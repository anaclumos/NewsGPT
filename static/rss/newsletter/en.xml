<ul>
<li>Disney has requested a Florida court to dismiss a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jeffrey Piccolo, whose wife died from anaphylaxis after dining at Raglan Road Irish Pub in Disney Springs.</li>
<li>Disney cited an arbitration waiver in the Disney+ terms and conditions, which Piccolo reportedly agreed to in 2019, arguing that disputes must be resolved through arbitration.</li>
<li>Piccolo&#39;s attorneys argue that the arbitration agreement is unreasonable and does not apply to Tangsuan&#39;s estate, calling Disney&#39;s motion &quot;preposterous.&quot; Disney declined to comment.</li>

<h2><a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/sweep-and-prune/">Sort, sweep, and prune: Collision detection algorithms (2023)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sweep-and-prune is highlighted as an efficient algorithm for collision detection in video games, reducing time complexity from O(n¬≤) to O(n log n + m).</li>
<li>The post is divided into two parts, with Part 1 covering a simplified version and Part 2 delving into more sophisticated versions, both with visual comparisons and code examples.</li>
<li>Sorting objects by their minimum x-coordinate allows skipping unnecessary collision checks, significantly improving performance over the naive approach.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41241942">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The author recommends using insertion sort for collision detection due to the nearly sorted nature of object movements between frames, despite faster algorithms like mergesort or quicksort.</li>
<li>Modern algorithms such as Pattern Defeating Quicksort and Glidesort are also efficient for these cases.</li>
<li>Alternatives to sorting include looser indexing structures or spatial partitioning methods to identify potential collisions.</li>

<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41181871">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS) is a phenomenon where individuals feel compelled to buy multiple items out of fear they might become unavailable or break.</li>
<li>This behavior spans various hobbies, such as photography and music, and can even extend to everyday items like shoes, often leading to regret when items become obsolete.</li>
<li>GAS is driven by fear of missing out, the allure of new gear, and the belief that better equipment will enhance skills, but it often results in clutter and financial strain without significantly improving abilities.</li>

<ul>
<li>Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors have been experiencing instability issues, potentially due to physical degradation, with some failure rates reported as high as 50%.</li>
<li>Intel plans to release a microcode patch by mid-August to prevent further degradation, though it won&#39;t reverse existing damage.</li>
<li>Puget Systems has experienced fewer issues due to their conservative power management approach and plans to validate Intel&#39;s update, extend warranties, and upgrade affected customers if necessary.</li>

<li>Puget Systems reports a 2-4% failure rate in Intel CPUs, which some users consider high, with failures often linked to overclocking or specific models like the AMD Ryzen 5950x.</li>
<li>Intel&#39;s recent CPU issues are attributed to manufacturing errors, and aggressive motherboard settings may worsen the problem.</li>
<li>Data indicates higher CPU failure rates in data centers and during summer months, emphasizing the complexity of diagnosing failures and the influence of overclocking and environmental factors.</li>

<ul>
<li>CU Boulder Classics scholars have discovered significant new fragments of two lost tragedies by the Greek playwright Euripides.</li>
<li>The fragments, from the plays Polyidus and Ino, were identified after months of study by Yvona Trnka-Amrhein and John Gibert.</li>
<li>This discovery, considered the most significant in over fifty years, will be presented at the Ninth Fountain Symposium on the CU Boulder campus.</li>

<ul>
<li>Cortex A73 addresses power and thermal issues in Arm‚Äôs early 64-bit cores, focusing on efficiency and the smartphone CPU market.</li>
<li>A unique out-of-order retirement mechanism allows the CPU to calculate results without waiting for instruction execution confirmation, preserving the illusion of in-order execution.</li>
<li>The A73 can handle 50 in-flight loads but only 11 in-flight stores after an unresolved branch, showing a regression from A72, yet it achieves competitive performance at lower power by balancing IPC (Instructions Per Cycle) and clock speed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41156474">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The discussion revolves around the Cortex A73&#39;s reordering capacity and various CPU architecture concepts, including register allocation and out-of-order (OoO) execution.</li>
<li>Key points include the idea of integrating Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) with registers to reduce read/write port needs, and the challenges of register renaming and operand forwarding in modern CPUs.</li>
<li>The conversation also touches on alternative architectures like the Mill architecture and Processing in Memory, highlighting ongoing innovations and debates in CPU design.</li>

<ul>
<li>A software engineer named Hazel managed to keep nearly 7,500 tabs open in Firefox for two years, showcasing the browser&#39;s capability to handle extensive tab usage.</li>
<li>Despite initial issues, Hazel restored her tabs using Firefox&#39;s profile cache, with the session file being only around 70MB, indicating minimal memory impact.</li>
<li>Mozilla confirmed that having many tabs open consumes &quot;practically no memory&quot; and announced upcoming tab management tools expected later in 2024, enhancing user experience.</li>

<li>A Firefox user maintained 7,500 open tabs for two years, using them as a form of history and bookmarks, highlighting a common practice among users.</li>
<li>Browsers have adapted by unloading inactive tabs to manage memory usage, and extensions like &quot;Tab Session Manager&quot; and &quot;OneTab&quot; assist in managing large numbers of tabs.</li>
<li>There is a suggestion to merge tabs, history, bookmarks, and tab groups into a single feature to streamline user experience and improve efficiency.</li>
