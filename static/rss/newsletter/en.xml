<li>A vulnerability in the eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) Linux kernel was discovered and fixed, highlighting the importance of the eBPF verifier in preventing kernel crashes.</li>
<li>eBPF verifier bugs are significant but often don&#39;t affect platforms where unprivileged code can&#39;t load eBPF programs, making them more manageable in server environments.</li>
<li>Despite its complexity, eBPF is widely used and supported by large tech companies due to its flexibility and ability to solve problems that would otherwise require custom kernel patches.</li>

<h2><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-superconductor-microprocessor-yields-a-substantial-boost-in-efficiency">Superconducting Microprocessors? Turns Out They&#39;re Ultra-Efficient (2021)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A 2.5 GHz superconducting microprocessor prototype has been developed, using 80 times less energy than traditional semiconductor microprocessors, even when accounting for cooling.</li>
<li>The MANA microprocessor, based on Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP) technology, contains over 20,000 superconductor Josephson junctions.</li>
<li>This is the first adiabatic superconducting microprocessor, marking a significant advancement in energy-efficient computing technology.</li>

<ul>
<li>Researchers in Japan are developing ultra-efficient superconducting microprocessors that operate adiabatically, theoretically avoiding energy loss or gain during computation.</li>
<li>This technology challenges Landauer&#39;s principle, which states that erasing information requires energy, by using reversible computing with special logic gates like the Toffoli gate to minimize energy expenditure.</li>
<li>Despite its promising efficiency, practical implementation faces significant challenges, particularly in cooling and scaling for practical use, and still requires energy to set initial bits and manage environmental noise.</li>

<h2><a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/crowdstrike-bug-hit-banks-hard/">Why the CrowdStrike bug hit banks hard</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>On July 19th, a configuration bug in CrowdStrike Falcon, an endpoint monitoring software, caused catastrophic failures in Windows systems, severely impacting the banking sector and other industries.</li>
<li>The bug led to widespread operational disruptions, including idling tellers and bankers, and even caused some banks to run out of physical cash, highlighting vulnerabilities in financial infrastructure.</li>
<li>U.S. banking regulators indirectly influenced the adoption of such security tools, which, while intended for protection, can introduce significant vulnerabilities due to their high privileges and widespread use.</li>

<ul>
<li>A CrowdStrike bug caused significant disruptions in banks due to an automatic update that bypassed existing controls.</li>
<li>The incident has sparked debates about the risks of relying on single vendors and the necessity for better update strategies.</li>
<li>Despite the widespread issues, some users experienced minimal impact, showcasing the resilience of certain systems.</li>

<h2><a href="https://coldwar-ct.com/Home_Page_S1DO.html">Construction of the AT&amp;T Long Lines &quot;Cheshire&quot; underground site</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The Cheshire ATT facility, built in 1966, is an underground complex designed for critical military communications, featuring a hardened analog L4 carrier cable and an AUTOVON 4-wire switch.</li>
<li>The facility includes extensive infrastructure for air filtration, power generation, and blast protection, ensuring operational continuity during nuclear events.</li>
<li>The site also served as a metropolitan junction for Hartford and New Haven, connecting to various other critical communication paths and facilities.</li>

<li>The AT&amp;T Long Lines &quot;Cheshire&quot; underground site was an AUTOVON switching center, built to endure a nuclear war using Western Electric&#39;s 1ESS technology.</li>
<li>These centers were strategically located away from major cities and military targets, featuring redundant links, hardened structures, and cooling and contamination protection for workers.</li>
<li>The infrastructure, developed during the Cold War, included extensive microwave point-to-point links and used both 1ESS and Number 5 Crossbar switches, highlighting its resilience and complexity.</li>

<h2><a href="https://eos.org/science-updates/how-great-was-the-great-oxidation-event">How great was the Great Oxidation Event?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Scientists are uncertain when Earth&#39;s atmosphere had enough oxygen to support early animal life, despite extensive research.</li>
<li>New findings from Rio Tinto, Spain, suggest that sufficient oxygen for animal evolution might have been present nearly 2 billion years before animals appeared.</li>
<li>Recent research indicates that fluctuating ocean oxygen levels, food scarcity, or genetic development time, rather than oxygen levels, might have delayed animal evolution.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) marked a significant rise in Earth&#39;s atmospheric oxygen due to photosynthetic microbes over at least 400 million years.</li>
<li>This increase in oxygen enabled the development of complex life forms and the possibility of fire but caused a mass extinction of anaerobic organisms.</li>
<li>The GOE is crucial for astrobiology, as high oxygen levels on exoplanets can indicate potential biological activity, with ongoing research continually refining our understanding.</li>
