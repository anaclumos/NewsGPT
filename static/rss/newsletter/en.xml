<h2><a href="https://www.buzl.uk/2024/08/24/reddit.html">Reddit banned me for developing Geddit</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In August 2024, the developer of Geddit, a non-commercial, open-source Reddit client, was permanently banned from Reddit.</li>
<li>The issue began in June 2023 when Reddit introduced new API pricing, charging $12,000 per 50 million requests, which threatened non-commercial apps like Geddit.</li>
<li>Despite Geddit&#39;s popularity, with over 25k downloads, Reddit misunderstood its non-commercial nature, leading to the developer pausing the project and receiving no further communication from Reddit.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>BMW surpassed Tesla in European electric vehicle (EV) sales for the first time in July 2024, but this is a misleading headline as Tesla remains ahead year-to-date (YTD).</li>
<li>The increase in BMW registrations was marginal, with only about 300 more cars registered in July, and this occurred during a period when Tesla had fewer cars available for sale due to their production and shipping schedule.</li>
<li>The metric used, car registrations, may not perfectly reflect actual sales, as it can be influenced by various factors such as dealer inventory and timing of consumer purchases.</li>
