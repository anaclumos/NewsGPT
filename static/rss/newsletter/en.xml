<ul>
<li>The Witcher 3 has successfully run on a RISC-V PC, marking the first AAA game to do so, thanks to advancements in Box64, Wine, and DXVK.</li>
<li>Significant progress has been made in the RISC-V backend, including fixing RV64 DynaRec bugs and adding new x86 instructions, facilitated by new hardware like the Milk-V Pioneer and VisionFive 2.</li>
<li>Despite challenges such as the lack of 16-byte atomic instructions and lower translation efficiency compared to other architectures, The Witcher 3 runs at up to 15 fps in-game on RISC-V.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41364549">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Box64 is an emulator enabling x86-64 applications to run on non-x86-64 architectures, such as RISC-V, by using native system libraries for better performance.</li>
<li>Running The Witcher 3 on RISC-V involves translating x86-64 instructions to RISC-V, which is challenging due to differences in instruction sets and the need for efficient GPU translation.</li>
<li>RISC-V&#39;s open and flexible nature, despite lacking some features like SIMD optimizations, makes it a promising alternative to proprietary architectures like x86-64 and ARM, with ongoing efforts to enhance its performance and compatibility.</li>

<h2><a href="https://transactional.blog/blog/2024-erasure-coding">Erasure Coding for Distributed Systems</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Erasure coding enhances storage efficiency and fault tolerance by splitting data into chunks and adding parity chunks, allowing data reconstruction even if some chunks are lost.</li>
<li>Key applications include storage systems (reducing costs and increasing durability) and quorum systems (improving read performance with some write limitations).</li>
<li>Popular libraries for implementing erasure codes are Jerasure and Intel ISA-L, with adaptive schemes like HRaft adjusting based on available replicas.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41361281">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The discussion centers around erasure coding, a method for data protection in distributed systems, highlighting its use in various technologies like Ceph and RaptorQ.</li>
<li>Erasure coding is praised for its efficiency in data recovery and fault tolerance, but it also has complexities and limitations, such as inelasticity in updating coding parameters and computational intensity.</li>
<li>The conversation includes references to specific implementations and algorithms, such as Luby Transform Code, RaptorQ, and Wirehair, and touches on potential patent issues and practical applications in real-world systems.</li>

<h2><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/2u-edx-bankruptcy/">The Triple Failure of 2U, EdX, and Axim</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In 2021, 2U acquired edX for $800 million, leading to financial strain and eventual bankruptcy by 2024.</li>
<li>The acquisition added $42 million in annual interest expenses, and efforts to reduce costs and unify operations under the edX brand failed.</li>
<li>Axim Collaborative, the non-profit holding the $800 million from the sale, has shown minimal impact on the edtech space, becoming primarily a grant-giving organization.</li>

<h2><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2024/08/25/telegram-is-not-really-an-encrypted-messaging-app/">Is Telegram really an encrypted messaging app?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Telegramâs CEO Pavel Durov was recently arrested by French authorities for insufficient content moderation, highlighting concerns about the platform&#39;s security practices.</li>
<li>Telegram is often labeled as an âencrypted messaging app,â but it does not offer default end-to-end encryption, requiring users to manually activate âSecret Chatsâ for private conversations, which is not available for group chats.</li>
<li>Despite its growth, Telegram has not improved its encryption usability, and its marketing as a secure messenger is misleading, posing risks to users who believe their conversations are private.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41350530">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The discussion questions whether Telegram is truly an encrypted messaging app, focusing on its end-to-end encryption (E2EE) capabilities.</li>
<li>The &quot;mud puddle test&quot; is mentioned, suggesting that if you can recover old messages on a new device, law enforcement might also access them, indicating potential security flaws.</li>
<li>Telegram&#39;s privacy policies and its ability to comply with law enforcement requests are debated, with some arguing it is a trust-based app rather than a cryptographically secure one.</li>

<ul>
<li>In August 2024, the developer of Geddit, a non-commercial, open-source Reddit client, was permanently banned from Reddit.</li>
<li>The issue began in June 2023 when Reddit introduced new API pricing, charging $12,000 per 50 million requests, which threatened non-commercial apps like Geddit.</li>
<li>Despite Geddit&#39;s popularity, with over 25k downloads, Reddit misunderstood its non-commercial nature, leading to the developer pausing the project and receiving no further communication from Reddit.</li>

<ul>
<li>BMW surpassed Tesla in European electric vehicle (EV) sales for the first time in July 2024, but this is a misleading headline as Tesla remains ahead year-to-date (YTD).</li>
<li>The increase in BMW registrations was marginal, with only about 300 more cars registered in July, and this occurred during a period when Tesla had fewer cars available for sale due to their production and shipping schedule.</li>
<li>The metric used, car registrations, may not perfectly reflect actual sales, as it can be influenced by various factors such as dealer inventory and timing of consumer purchases.</li>

<ul>
<li>Didier RÃ©my&#39;s 1988 algorithm for type generalization in OCaml enhances type inference speed by avoiding inefficient environment scans, using levels to track type dependencies.</li>
<li>RÃ©my&#39;s method, akin to generational garbage collection, ensures type variables are only quantified when their defining region is inactive, preventing unsound generalization.</li>
<li>OCaml&#39;s type checker implements this algorithm, using levels to manage type variables and enforce scope discipline, significantly improving type inference efficiency.</li>
