<ul>
<li>The federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that geofence warrants are &quot;categorically prohibited by the Fourth Amendment,&quot; aligning with the EFF&#39;s arguments against general, exploratory searches.</li>
<li>The case, United States v. Smith, involved police using a geofence warrant to obtain location data from Google during a 2018 armed robbery investigation, which the court found violated individuals&#39; reasonable expectation of privacy.</li>
<li>Despite ruling geofence warrants unconstitutional, the court allowed the evidence in this case due to police reliance on the technology in good faith, emphasizing the need for strict Fourth Amendment protections.</li>

<ul>
<li>Base 3 computing, or ternary, uses three digits (0, 1, 2) and is more efficient than binary, as two ternary &quot;trits&quot; can represent nine numbers compared to four numbers by two binary bits.</li>
<li>Ternary computing has a lower radix economy for large numbers, making it the most economical integer base, and can answer questions with three possible outcomes, reducing the number of queries needed.</li>
<li>Despite its efficiency, ternary computing never gained widespread use due to the dominance of binary hardware and software, but recent advancements suggest potential applications in cybersecurity with lower error rates.</li>

<h2><a href="https://news.alvaroduran.com/p/cringey-but-true-how-uber-tests-payments">How Uber tests payments in production</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Uber tests its payment systems directly in production to catch unknown issues quickly, a method that contrasts with the more common use of staging environments.</li>
<li>This approach involves incremental rollouts in small, representative regions and uses tools like Cerberus and Deputy for transparency and monitoring.</li>
<li>Uber&#39;s strategy focuses on resilience and quick rollbacks, ensuring high-quality software by addressing real-world issues, as demonstrated by their successful GooglePay rollout in Portugal.</li>

<li>Uber is testing payments in production using real cards and API endpoints because testing APIs are often inadequate for catching certain bugs.</li>
<li>This practice, though common, involves using corporate cards and faces legal and procedural challenges, highlighting the need for careful management to avoid fraud and compliance issues.</li>
<li>While companies like Stripe provide robust sandbox environments, transitioning to production can still present unforeseen issues, making real-world testing crucial for accuracy.</li>

<h2><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1910322">Jeremy Rowley resigns from DigiCert due to mass-revocation incident</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>DigiCert identified a DNS-based validation issue with CNAME records lacking an underscore prefix, potentially leading to certificate mis-issuance, affecting 83,267 certificates and 6,807 subscribers.</li>
<li>The root cause was a system update error due to siloed teams and insufficient compliance checks; immediate actions included revoking all affected certificates and planning to open-source their domain validation system.</li>

<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41181871">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS) is a phenomenon where individuals feel compelled to buy multiple items out of fear they might become unavailable or break.</li>
<li>This behavior spans various hobbies, such as photography and music, and can even extend to everyday items like shoes, often leading to regret when items become obsolete.</li>
<li>GAS is driven by fear of missing out, the allure of new gear, and the belief that better equipment will enhance skills, but it often results in clutter and financial strain without significantly improving abilities.</li>
