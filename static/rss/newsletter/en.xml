<h2><a href="https://www.circle-lang.org/draft-profiles.html">Why Safety Profiles Failed</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Safety Profiles, introduced in 2015 to enhance memory safety in C++ code, failed due to incorrect assumptions about the sufficiency of existing code information for ensuring safety.- Unlike Rust, which uses lifetime parameters and borrow checking, C++ lacks necessary aliasing, lifetime, and safeness information, making compile-time memory safety unachievable.- The failure of Safety Profiles highlights the need for C++ to adopt explicit aliasing, lifetime, and safeness properties, potentially integrating Rust&#39;s safety model to improve security and interoperability.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41939967">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>C++ faces challenges with memory safety due to its use of iterators, which can lead to aliasing issues, whereas the D language uses arrays with defined lengths to mitigate these problems.</li>
<li>Safety profiles in C++ are debated as potentially being more of a distraction than a solution, as they do not fully ensure memory safety, unlike Safe C++ which aims for complete memory safety by default.</li>
<li>The complexity of C++ makes implementing safety difficult without major changes, and while Rust offers a safer alternative, transitioning existing C++ codebases remains a significant challenge.</li>
