<li>The European &quot;cookie law&quot; requires informed consent for tracking, but does not specifically mandate the use of cookie banners; companies opt for banners to comply.</li>
<li>A common issue is companies incorrectly implementing consent by setting tracking cookies by default and providing banners without a clear reject option, which is non-compliant.</li>
<li>The law&#39;s intent is to protect consumer rights, but companies often engage in &quot;malicious compliance&quot; to frustrate users, suggesting stricter enforcement and potential browser-based consent settings as solutions.</li>
