<li>Traditional RAG often loses context by splitting documents into smaller chunks; Contextual Retrieval addresses this by prepending chunk-specific explanatory context before embedding and creating the BM25 index.</li>

<li>Anthropic has introduced prompt caching to improve the cost-effectiveness of their Contextual Retrieval process, which is a method to enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) results by expanding chunks using a Large Language Model (LLM).</li>
<li>Prompt caching allows developers to save costs by storing the state after running a large document through a model, rather than regenerating each chunk every time, making it a significant update for those working with RAG workflows.</li>
<li>The post highlights that while the cookbook provides a guide for a specific RAG workflow, the real innovation lies in the cost-saving feature of prompt caching, which was introduced a month ago.</li>

<ul>
<li>OpenAI has released two new models, o1-preview and o1-mini, codenamed &quot;strawberry,&quot; which offer improved reasoning capabilities through a chain of thought prompting pattern.</li>
<li>These models are reserved for tier 5 accounts ($1,000+ on API credits) and introduce &quot;reasoning tokens&quot; that are billed but not visible in the API response, sparking some dissatisfaction due to lack of transparency.</li>
<li>The new models can handle complex prompts better and have increased output token allowances, expanding the potential tasks solvable by large language models (LLMs).</li>

<ul>
<li>OpenAI&#39;s new o1 chain-of-thought models still produce hallucinations, such as non-existent libraries and functions, and often provide incorrect facts.</li>
<li>Users observe that while reasoning capabilities have improved, the models still fail to verify the factual accuracy of their outputs, necessitating user double-checking.</li>
<li>Some users liken the models to naive but intelligent interns, suggesting they can be useful with proper guidance, though they lack the ability to ask clarifying questions or admit uncertainty, impacting their reliability.</li>
