<h2><a href="https://danluu.com/ballmer/">Steve Ballmer was an underrated CEO</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The narrative that Microsoft was failing under Steve Ballmer and saved by Satya Nadella is overly simplistic, as Ballmer&#39;s tenure included strong financials and strategic investments.- Significant achievements during Ballmer&#39;s era, such as launching Azure and Office 365, and building a strong enterprise sales arm, contributed to Microsoft&#39;s current success.- While Ballmer faced criticism for projects like Bing and Windows Phone, these were part of a broader strategy that laid the groundwork for future achievements under Nadella&#39;s leadership.</li>

<h2><a href="https://expressionstatement.com/html-form-validation-is-heavily-underused">HTML Form Validation is underused</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML Form Validation is often underutilized, despite offering powerful features through attributes like &quot;required&quot;, &quot;email&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, and &quot;pattern&quot;.</li>
<li>The setCustomValidity method allows for complex validation logic but is less adopted due to its cumbersome nature and lack of an attribute equivalent.</li>
<li>A proposed declarative approach with a customValidity attribute could simplify complex validations, potentially influencing future updates to the HTML Specification.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41976529">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>HTML form validation is frequently underused because browsers like Chrome and Firefox restrict custom styling of validation messages, causing design inconsistencies.- Native validation lacks flexibility, such as displaying multiple errors per field or managing form-wide errors, prompting developers to use custom validation for consistency.- Despite its limitations, native validation can be advantageous if implemented carefully to prevent user confusion and accessibility problems.</li>
