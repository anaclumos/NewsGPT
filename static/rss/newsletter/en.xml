<h2><a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/redis-postgresql/">Do you need Redis? PostgreSQL does queuing, locking, and pub/sub (2021)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The blog post by Chris Farber examines if Redis is essential for web applications or if PostgreSQL can fulfill the same roles.- It highlights three Redis use cases: job queuing, application locks, and Pub/Sub, and explains how PostgreSQL can manage these tasks using SKIP LOCKED, advisory locks, and LISTEN/NOTIFY statements, respectively.- The discussion suggests that while Redis is superior in caching, PostgreSQL&#39;s capabilities might reduce the need for Redis, potentially lowering operational costs and complexity.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42036303">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The debate centers on whether Redis is necessary when PostgreSQL can manage queuing, locking, and publish/subscribe (pub/sub) functionalities.</li>
<li>Redis is praised for its speed and performance, especially when running on the same machine as the application, offering advantages over PostgreSQL&#39;s disk-based operations.</li>
<li>The choice between Redis and PostgreSQL should be based on specific use cases, such as the need for high-speed operations, shared memory, or persistence, with consideration for the complexity of distributed architectures.</li>
