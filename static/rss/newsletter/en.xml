<ul>
<li>The DEA and TSA have been collaborating to seize travelers&#39; money by targeting those carrying large amounts of cash, using informers and TSA checkpoints to identify individuals and claiming they &quot;consent&quot; to searches.</li>
<li>This practice, which extends to Amtrak trains with the help of US Customs and Border Protection, involves &quot;civil forfeiture&quot; where money is seized without a warrant, often ignoring passengers&#39; refusal to consent.</li>
<li>An ongoing class-action lawsuit highlights the frequency of these illegal searches, with plaintiffs arguing that the volume of records indicates a systemic issue, despite the DEA and TSA&#39;s resistance to disclosing these records.</li>

<li>Meta&#39;s Llama 3.1 models can generate multilingual text, but the current implementation in C is still buggy and requires further refinement.</li>
<li>The project involves quantizing the model to 8-bit, which can degrade the output quality, humorously referred to as &quot;brain damage.&quot;</li>
<li>The community is actively contributing to improving the implementation, with discussions around optimal quantization methods and extending context length using new scaling techniques.</li>

<li>In 1976, MIT-AI used &quot;at&quot; instead of the @ symbol for email addresses due to the absence of DNS (Domain Name System).</li>
<li>Early computer scientists preferred clear date formats like &quot;dd MON yy&quot; and discussed early network file systems and protocols such as MLDEV and SUPDUP.</li>
<li>Emacs, a text editor initially written in TECO, evolved with contributions from developers like James Gosling, who created a Unix version in 1981.</li>

<h2><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02383-9">You got a null result. Will anyone publish it?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Researchers face challenges in publishing null results, which show no significant relationship between variables, leading to a bias favoring positive findings.</li>
<li>This publication bias distorts the scientific record and wastes resources, as seen in evolutionary biologist Natalie Pilakouta&#39;s inconclusive study on fish preferences in Iceland&#39;s hot springs.</li>
<li>Efforts to address this issue include journals encouraging pre-registered reports, but slow adoption and the perception that null results indicate flawed research remain significant hurdles.</li>

<ul>
<li>The discussion highlights the challenges and lack of incentives for publishing null results in scientific research, despite their potential value.</li>
<li>A significant portion of scientists are willing to publish null results, but very few are able to do so due to systemic barriers and lack of demand from high-tier journals.</li>
<li>Suggestions include creating dedicated journals for null results, integrating null results as appendices to main publications, and improving the peer review process to include pre-registration of methods.</li>
