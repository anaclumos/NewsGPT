<ul>
<li>13ft is a self-hosted alternative to 12ft.io, developed by GitHub user wasi_master, and has gained unexpected popularity despite being a proof of concept.</li>
<li>The project involves setting the user agent header to Googlebot, which has sparked discussions on its effectiveness, potential issues like IP verification, and ethical considerations of bypassing paywalls.</li>
<li>Users have suggested alternatives such as browser extensions or using archive services, highlighting the ongoing debate about supporting journalism in the digital age.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://eric-fritz.com/articles/sourcegraph-went-dark/">Sourcegraph went dark</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sourcegraph transitioned to a private company on August 19, 2024, moving away from its open-source origins.</li>
<li>The change has led to the sourcegraph/sourcegraph repository becoming private, affecting references in engineering blogs and necessitating the use of a public snapshot or personal forks.</li>
<li>To maintain the integrity of his references, the author created a Go program to scrape pull request data, extracted relevant commits, and automated the process of updating links using bash scripts.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Sourcegraph has made its main internal codebase private to improve product development, citing complexity, abuse of their AI tool Cody, and confusion between open-source and enterprise versions.</li>

<h2><a href="https://maxschmitt.me/posts/toasts-bad-ux">Toasts Are Bad UX</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Toast notifications often appear far from the user&#39;s focus, causing usability issues, such as on YouTube where the toast appears in the bottom left while the user is focused on a modal in the center.</li>
<li>Suggested solutions include displaying playlists beneath the button instead of in a modal and using loading indicators to imply action completion, eliminating the need for toasts.</li>
<li>Examples from Gmail and clipboard actions show that toasts can be redundant, as other forms of feedback (like removing an email from the list or button confirmations) can effectively communicate success.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41298794">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The debate centers on whether toasts (small, temporary notifications) are bad UX (User Experience) due to their redundancy and potential to distract users.</li>
<li>Proponents argue that toasts provide essential feedback, especially for actions that are not immediately visible, and can include undo options, enhancing usability.</li>
<li>Critics highlight issues such as toasts disappearing too quickly, being inaccessible to screen magnifier users, and causing distractions, suggesting alternatives like in-context feedback or message logs.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://zarar.dev/anatomy-of-a-mental-breakdown/">The anatomy of a 2AM mental breakdown</a></h2>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>The Gervais Principle, derived from &quot;The Office,&quot; categorizes employees into Sociopaths, Clueless, and Losers, offering a new theory of management.</li>
<li>Sociopaths drive the organization, Clueless individuals are promoted over-performing Losers, and Losers trade long-term potential for short-term stability.</li>
<li>This principle explains character dynamics in &quot;The Office&quot; and aligns with Gareth Morgan’s metaphor of organizations as psychic prisons.</li>
