<h2><a href="http://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2024/05/monetagium.html">Monetagium – monetary extortion in feudal Europe</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Monetagium was a medieval practice where the public paid a fee to avoid the debasement of coinage, which would cause inflation and financial instability.</li>
<li>Introduced to England by William the Conqueror, it evolved into a triennial renewal of coinage, which was unpopular and eventually abolished by Henry I.</li>
<li>Similar practices existed in Denmark with the &quot;plough tax,&quot; and modern democracies face analogous revenue challenges, though they rely on taxes instead of debasement.</li>

<ul>
<li>The post discusses the historical context and impact of monetary debasement, highlighting examples from ancient Rome and the Byzantine Empire.</li>
<li>It draws parallels between historical debasement and modern practices, such as the removal of silver from U.S. coins and the Federal Reserve&#39;s balance sheet adjustments.</li>
<li>The conversation extends to contemporary issues like the role of Bitcoin in addressing monetary debasement and the implications of deflationary currencies on the economy.</li>
