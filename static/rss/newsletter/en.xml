<li>Lori Emerson&#39;s book, &quot;Other Networks: A Radical Technology Sourcebook,&quot; highlights the largely undocumented history of barbed wire fence telephone networks, which were crucial in rural U.S. and Canada during the early- to mid-20th century.</li>
<li>Barbed wire, initially patented for fencing livestock, was repurposed by farmers for informal telephone networks, especially after the end of Alexander Graham Bell&#39;s patent monopoly in 1893-94, allowing rural communities to communicate without central exchanges or monthly bills.</li>
<li>Despite weather-related issues, these networks thrived and were used into the 1970s, providing essential communication for emergencies, weather updates, and social interaction in cooperative farming areas.</li>

<h1>2024-08-28</h1>
<h2><a href="https://gamengen.github.io">Diffusion models are real-time game engines</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Researchers introduced GameNGen, a neural model-powered game engine capable of real-time interaction, demonstrated by simulating the game DOOM at over 20 frames per second on a single TPU.</li>
<li>GameNGen uses a two-phase training process involving an RL-agent for data collection and a diffusion model for next frame prediction, achieving a PSNR of 29.4, comparable to lossy JPEG compression.</li>
<li>The model&#39;s architecture includes conditioning augmentations and fine-tuning of a pre-trained auto-encoder to ensure stable long-term generation and improved image quality, making it difficult for human raters to distinguish between real and simulated game clips.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41375548">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Diffusion models generate frames based on past frames and user actions but do not support real-time user input for dynamic adjustments.</li>
<li>Trained on a large dataset of DOOM gameplay, these models produce frames conditioned on current frames and user actions, resembling a neural recording rather than an interactive simulation.</li>
<li>While the technology is impressive, it faces limitations like inconsistent maintenance of internal game state, highlighting both its potential and challenges for game simulation.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://josephg.com/blog/crdts-go-brrr/">Faster CRDTs (2021)</a></h2>

<li>Tinyboxes, a high-performance computing device, now feature a &quot;buy it now&quot; button, making them more accessible for purchase.</li>
<li>The device, priced at $15k for Radeon and $25k for Nvidia, requires significant power (3200W) and may need two separate circuits in residential settings.</li>
<li>Concerns have been raised about its networking capabilities (64GB/s over PCIe) and suitability for fine-tuning large machine learning models, such as LLama 3.1 / 70B, due to VRAM limitations and interconnect bandwidth.</li>

<ul>
<li>Malicious hackers are exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2024-39717) in Versa Director, a software used by many Internet and IT service providers.</li>
<li>The cyber espionage group Volt Typhoon, linked to China, is suspected of targeting critical U.S. networks through this flaw, which allows attackers to upload files to vulnerable systems.</li>
<li>Versa has urged customers to patch the vulnerability with Versa Director 22.1.4 or later, while researchers from Black Lotus Labs identified a web-based backdoor on several systems and attributed the activity to Volt Typhoon with medium confidence.</li>

<li>A RAND report indicates that 80% of AI projects fail due to misunderstandings about the problems AI should address, inadequate data, and poor infrastructure.</li>
<li>Successful AI projects require early involvement of data scientists and machine learning (ML) engineers to ensure meaningful impact and bridge the gap between technical and domain experts.</li>
<li>Many AI initiatives are driven by hype rather than actual needs, leading to costly failures, with management issues and unrealistic expectations hindering AI&#39;s potential.</li>

<ul>
<li>Startup Deep Fission proposes a 30-inch wide nuclear reactor placed a mile underground to address economic and safety issues in nuclear power.</li>
<li>The reactor, based on a conventional pressurized water reactor (PWR), operates at 160 atmospheres and 315 °C (600 °F), using a passive cooling system and the water column&#39;s weight for pressurization.</li>
<li>This design eliminates the need for costly civil engineering and containment structures, and the reactor can be retrieved for inspection or servicing within hours; currently, Deep Fission is in the pre-application review process with the Department of Energy.</li>

<ul>
<li>Japan is facing rice shortages and rising prices despite normal crop yields due to a long-standing acreage reduction policy aimed at controlling market prices.</li>
<li>This policy, in place for over 50 years, incentivizes farmers to switch to other crops, leading to tightly managed rice production and vulnerability to demand fluctuations.</li>
<li>Experts suggest abolishing the policy, increasing rice production, and boosting exports to enhance food security and benefit consumers.</li>

<li>Japan is experiencing rice shortages despite normal crop yields due to government policies incentivizing farmers to reduce production to maintain high prices.</li>
<li>This 60-year-old policy limits supply, causing even minor demand increases, such as from tourism, to result in shortages and higher prices.</li>
<li>Critics suggest that Japan should abandon this policy to increase production, potentially becoming a major rice exporter and improving food security.</li>
