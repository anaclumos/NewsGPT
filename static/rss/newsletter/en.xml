<h2><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/10/01/terminal-colours/">Terminal colours are tricky</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Configuring terminal colors can be difficult due to readability issues and the lack of standardization in the shades of the 16 ANSI colors.- Users can adjust terminal colors through terminal emulator settings or shell scripts, and tools like iTerm2 offer features such as &quot;minimum contrast&quot; to enhance readability.- Synchronizing terminal and Vim themes can prevent color mismatches, with solutions like Base16-shell and base16-vim being popular, though not universally perfect.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Terminal colors can be difficult to manage due to differences in screen setups and limited support in some consoles, with light themes being more affected than dark themes.- To ensure compatibility with basic consoles, use fallback themes when using tools like <code>fd</code> or <code>exa</code>, and customize terminal emulator color schemes for better readability.- Avoid command-line interface (CLI) tools that override user color preferences with 8bit or 24bit colors; instead, use ANSI colors for consistency and adhere to accessibility guidelines for color contrast.</li>

<ul>
<li>A 25-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes became the first person to produce her own insulin after a stem cell transplant, remaining insulin-free for over a year.</li>
<li>The stem cells were reprogrammed from her own body and injected into her abdominal muscles, leading to stable blood glucose levels within two-and-a-half months.</li>
<li>This pioneering trial, led by Deng Hongkui from Peking University, marks a significant advancement in diabetes treatment, with further trials planned to replicate the results.</li>

<ul>
<li>California has enacted AB 2426, the first law to ban deceptive sales of &quot;disappearing media,&quot; requiring clear disclosure when digital goods are temporary licenses rather than outright purchases.</li>
<li>The law, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom and sponsored by Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, aims to protect consumers from unexpectedly losing access to digital content like books, movies, and video games.</li>
<li>Prompted by incidents with Ubisoft and Sony, the law mandates clear labeling and prohibits hiding disclosures in terms of service, with exceptions for goods advertised as licenses and subscription services.</li>

<h2><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-the-us-cant-build-icebreaking">Why the U.S. can&#39;t build icebreaking ships</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. has only two operational icebreakers, the Polar Star and Healy, and hasn&#39;t built a new heavy icebreaker since 1976, despite significant interests in polar regions.</li>
<li>The Polar Security Cutter program, initiated in 2013 to build new icebreakers, faces delays and cost overruns, with the first ship now expected by 2029 at a cost of $1.7-1.9 billion per ship.</li>
<li>U.S. shipyards lack experience in building icebreakers, and protectionist laws requiring domestic construction hinder the potential for more efficient and cost-effective foreign-built ships.</li>

<li>The U.S. faces challenges in building icebreaking ships due to uncompetitive shipbuilders and potentially overly ambitious government requirements.</li>
<li>High costs and low production rates have left the U.S. shipbuilding industry struggling, similar to Canada, which also lacks recent experience in building specialized icebreakers.</li>
<li>Collaborating with countries like Finland, which have expertise in icebreaker construction, could help, but protectionist laws like the Jones Act complicate purchasing foreign-built ships.</li>

<ul>
<li>&quot;small3dlib&quot; is a public domain 3D software rasterizer designed for resource-limited computers, using only 32-bit integer math and no dependencies, making it extremely portable.</li>
<li>It offers various features like perspective correction, different drawing strategies, and flexibility in pixel rendering, but lacks advanced features like shaders, collision detection, and antialiasing.</li>
<li>The library is ideal for quick 3D projects without the complexity of OpenGL or Vulkan, and is highly customizable, though it does not prioritize backward compatibility.</li>
