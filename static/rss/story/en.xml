      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Despite being declared &quot;dead&quot; in 1992, Cobol has persisted and outlasted many fourth-generation programming languages (4GLs), demonstrating its resilience and continued relevance.</li>
<li>The Y2K problem played a significant role in reviving Cobol by creating a demand for programmers familiar with the language, highlighting its importance in legacy systems.</li>
<li>The narrative suggests caution in labeling programming languages as &quot;dead,&quot; especially those with a substantial user base, as they may continue to have practical applications and influence.</li>

<li>Social media platforms often alter terms or introduce paid plans unexpectedly, as seen with Twitch&#39;s &quot;Boost&quot; program and OnlyFans&#39; near-ban on adult content, posing risks for content creators.- The main advice is to avoid building a business solely on external platforms; instead, prioritize developing your own website, mailing list, and intellectual property.- Creators should use social media to gain followers but ensure they redirect them to their own platforms, maintaining control over their audience and content despite platform changes.</li>

<li>The author discusses the challenge of reducing the default installation size of NixOS, a server operating system, which initially takes up about 900MB of disk space.- Efforts to minimize NixOS involved removing unnecessary components like Nix, Perl, Python, and certain services, achieving a reduction of approximately 300MB.- Despite these reductions, the author concludes that creating a minimal NixOS system is complex and suggests that a dedicated &quot;fork&quot; of NixOS for server scenarios might be more effective.</li>

<li>The strong version of Goodhart&#39;s law suggests that over-optimizing a proxy measure can lead to worse outcomes in the actual goal, as seen in standardized testing and machine learning overfitting.</li>
<li>This concept is applicable across various fields, including politics, economics, and health, indicating the broad relevance of the phenomenon.</li>
<li>Mitigation strategies from machine learning, such as aligning proxy goals with desired outcomes, adding regularization penalties, injecting noise, and using early stopping, can help manage these issues.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Discord initially used MongoDB for message storage but switched to Cassandra for better scalability and fault tolerance, which later led to performance and maintenance issues.</li>
<li>In 2022, Discord migrated from Cassandra to ScyllaDB, a more efficient, C++-based, Cassandra-compatible database, reducing nodes from 177 to 72 and significantly improving latency and performance.</li>
<li>The migration involved dual-writing new data and using a Rust-based migrator for historical data, resulting in fewer issues and better handling of increased traffic during major events like the World Cup.</li>

<li>Wafris, an open-source web application firewall company, is transitioning its Rails middleware client from Redis to SQLite to address deployment issues and improve performance.</li>
<li>SQLite was chosen for its reduced network latency and better performance in read-heavy operations, showing a 3x speed improvement over Redis in local benchmarks.</li>
<li>The new architecture simplifies deployment, enhances user experience, and scales better by syncing databases to each compute instance, while handling writes asynchronously to mitigate SQLite&#39;s limitations in write-heavy tasks.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Users have reported that Uber fares appear higher when using credits, such as those from American Express or Uber gift cards, compared to paying out-of-pocket.</li>
<li>Instances include a $20 ride increasing to $30 when credits are applied, while the same ride remains $20 on a different phone without credits.</li>
<li>This suggests Uber might be experimenting with higher pricing for users with credits, raising concerns about potential overcharging.</li>
</ul>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The iPhone 16 introduces significant repairability improvements, including a new battery adhesive that debonds with an electrical current, a hard steel battery case for the Pro model, and a dual-entry design for easier repairs.</li>
<li>iOS 18’s Repair Assistant aims to eliminate parts pairing software barriers, making component pairing and calibration seamless.</li>
<li>The iPhone 16 earns a repairability score of 7 out of 10, an improvement from last year, due to better repair manuals, the new battery procedure, and the dual-entry design.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Restricting high-emitting vehicles in cities leads to cleaner air and quieter streets, prompting the creation of clean air zones in over 300 areas across Europe.</li>
<li>London&#39;s ultra-low emissions zone resulted in 2 out of 5 students switching to walking or biking to school, positively impacting children&#39;s health and academic performance, according to a study by the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University.</li>
<li>Replicating such zones in the U.S. faces legal challenges, but improving infrastructure for walking and biking, along with discouraging car travel, can be effective strategies.</li>
</ul>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>CEOs and mainstream media advocate for a return to office work, citing productivity concerns, but the underlying issue is the debt on empty office buildings.</li>
<li>Remote work has shown to be equally productive, offering employees fewer distractions and better work-life balance.</li>
<li>The push to return to offices is driven by a financial crisis in commercial real estate, with $1.2 trillion in loans on office towers at risk, potentially leading to broader financial instability.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article compares two main types of CO2 sensors: NDIR (Non-Dispersive Infrared) and photo-acoustic sensors, highlighting their performance differences.</li>
<li>NDIR sensors, like the SenseAir S8, are accurate and perform well both indoors and outdoors, while photo-acoustic sensors, such as the Sensirion SCD40/41, are smaller but struggle with outdoor measurements due to environmental variations.</li>
<li>The conclusion suggests that the SenseAir S8 is reliable for all conditions, whereas the Sensirion SCD4x is best suited for indoor use only.</li>
</ul>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>At HotChips 2024, Tesla announced the open-sourcing of the Tesla Transport Protocol over Ethernet (TTPoE) and its membership in the Ultra Ethernet Consortium (UEC) to standardize a new high-speed/low-latency fabric for AI, ML, and datacenters.</li>
<li>TTPoE, akin to TCP, ensures complete data transmission despite packet loss and replays, and operates entirely in hardware without requiring a CPU or OS, initially deployed for Tesla Dojo v1.</li>
<li>The GitHub repository includes the TTPoE Transport Header, specification details, a Linux kernel software model, unit tests, a packet generation utility, and example sessions demonstrating the protocol&#39;s functionality.</li>
</ul>
