<li>On July 19, 2024, a CrowdStrike software update caused the largest IT outage in history, impacting 8.5 million Windows computers, including critical systems in hospitals, banks, and airlines.</li>
<li>The outage led to a significant reduction in air traffic for major airlines, with Delta experiencing a 46% reduction in flights, United 36%, and American 16%, while Southwest Airlines remained unaffected.</li>
<li>The prolonged recovery for Delta was due to the absence of a proper disaster recovery plan, highlighting the importance of robust contingency strategies in mitigating such disruptions.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Fabien Sanglard&#39;s exploration of the Super Nintendo (SNES) video system highlights the design decisions made by Nintendo engineers in 1989 to ensure compatibility with CRT TVs and NTSC standards.</li>
<li>The SNES used a master clock of 21.47727MHz, divided to achieve a dot clock of 5.3693175MHz, resulting in 341 dots per line and a 60.098Hz refresh rate, with horizontal and vertical blanking periods to avoid artifacts.</li>
<li>The SNES supported both NTSC and PAL standards, providing composite and S-Video outputs, and could double vertical and horizontal resolutions for specific applications, despite challenges like flickering.</li>
</ul>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Tools like clang-tidy and PVS-Studio may flag <code>push_back</code> as &quot;bad style&quot; and suggest <code>emplace_back</code>, but this change is not always beneficial.</li>
<li><code>emplace_back</code> should be used to avoid creating temporary objects, but it is not related to move semantics and can still result in copies if not used correctly.</li>
<li>Prefer <code>push_back</code> for simplicity and faster compile times, using <code>emplace_back</code> only when necessary for non-movable types or to avoid temporary objects.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Higher-kinded polymorphism, which abstracts over type constructors, is crucial for generic operations over collections and embedding typed Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs).</li>
<li>OCaml doesn&#39;t natively support higher-kinded polymorphism due to type aliasing issues, but it can be simulated using functors, defunctionalization, and initial algebras.</li>
<li>Various methods, including functor abstraction and reducing to ordinary polymorphism, allow achieving higher-kinded polymorphism in OCaml, though sometimes it may not be necessary.</li>

<li>Dr. Teresa Belton, an education expert, asserts that allowing children to experience boredom is crucial for fostering creativity, as constant activity can hinder imagination.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>SQLite reads and writes small blobs (e.g., thumbnail images) 35% faster than using individual files on disk, and uses about 20% less disk space.</li>
<li>The efficiency is attributed to fewer open() and close() system calls and tighter data packing, with performance expected to improve in future versions.</li>
<li>Tests show SQLite generally outperforms direct file I/O, especially on Windows with anti-virus software enabled, though performance can vary based on hardware and OS.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Switzerland has passed a law requiring government agencies to use open-source software (OSS) and publish new government code under open-source licenses, known as the &quot;Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Government Tasks&quot; (EMBAG).</li>
<li>This initiative aims to improve transparency, security, and efficiency by making non-personal, non-security-sensitive government data publicly accessible.</li>
<li>Switzerland&#39;s move aligns with similar European initiatives and could potentially inspire further adoption of OSS in Europe and the U.S.</li>

<li>Intel’s 13th and 14th Gen CPUs have a crashing issue due to elevated voltages and manufacturing defects, which cannot be fixed if damage has already occurred.</li>
<li>A patch to prevent future issues is expected in mid-August, but damaged CPUs will need to be replaced; Intel will not recall or extend warranties.</li>
<li>Affected users should update their BIOS and contact Intel Customer Support, as the issue potentially affects any 13th or 14th Gen desktop processor consuming 65W or more power.</li>

<li>The DEA and TSA have been collaborating to seize travelers&#39; money by targeting those carrying large amounts of cash, using informers and TSA checkpoints to identify individuals and claiming they &quot;consent&quot; to searches.</li>
<li>This practice, which extends to Amtrak trains with the help of US Customs and Border Protection, involves &quot;civil forfeiture&quot; where money is seized without a warrant, often ignoring passengers&#39; refusal to consent.</li>

<li>Despite its necessity, Pin introduces significant complexity for users due to its lack of syntactic sugar and support, leading to issues like reborrowing, pinned projections, and interactions with the Drop trait.</li>

<li>The author has been exploring and discussing the foundations of ChatGPT and other Generative AIs, aiming to provide realistic perspectives against the prevailing hype.</li>
<li>A key insight is that ChatGPT does not truly summarize content but merely shortens it, often missing essential details and proposals, as evidenced by a comparison with a human-generated summary of a 50-page paper.</li>
<li>This limitation arises because summarizing requires understanding, which ChatGPT lacks, leading to skepticism about the reliability of LLMs (Large Language Models) for practical business applications.</li>

<li>Sharing sex tech code on platforms like GitHub can help establish best practices, but developers should be cautious with explicit media and consider self-hosting sensitive materials.</li>
<li>The Buttplug project emphasizes safety, autonomy, and human rights, encouraging responsible behavior and education in its mission statement.</li>

<li>Jeff Johnson reported a surge of fake reviews for top paid apps in the U.S. Mac App Store, affecting 8 out of the top 40 paid apps between June 11 and July 19, 2024.</li>
<li>The fake reviews, often 5-star with generic or nonsensical text, were likely intended to boost app ratings, with suspicions that a single developer might be behind them to obscure their own app&#39;s fake reviews.</li>
<li>Despite reports to Apple, the issue remains unaddressed, with developers of BetterSnapTool and Vinegar acknowledging and reporting the problem to Apple.</li>

<li>Over the past decade, trench collapses have resulted in over 250 worker fatalities in the U.S., many of which could have been prevented with adherence to basic safety regulations.</li>
<li>Despite OSHA&#39;s (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) regulations and fines, many companies continue to violate safety standards with minimal consequences, as criminal charges are rare and fines are often reduced or ignored.</li>
<li>An investigation by NPR, Texas Public Radio, and 1A underscores the urgent need for stricter enforcement and accountability to prevent future tragedies.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Macintosh file system featured two forks: a data fork and a resource fork, with the latter storing structured data like icons, dialogs, and code chunks.</li>
<li>Apple’s ResEdit, a resource editor last updated in 1994, allowed users to customize system files, dialogs, and keyboard layouts, but posed security risks as malware often exploited resource forks.</li>
<li>With Mac OS X, resource forks transitioned to extended attributes, and app resources are now organized into bundles, with modern apps being locked down by signatures, preventing the extensive customizations once possible with ResEdit.</li>
