<li>Greppability, the ease of searching for code elements, is an important but often overlooked metric in code maintenance.</li>
<li>Key practices to enhance greppability include avoiding dynamic identifier construction, using consistent naming conventions across the stack, and preferring flat over nested structures.</li>
<li>These practices help prevent frustration and errors when navigating and maintaining unfamiliar codebases.</li>

<li>The author describes the &quot;Hydra Project Effect,&quot; where solving one challenge in a project leads to new challenges, creating a cycle of unfinished work.</li>
<li>To break this cycle, the author suggests strategies such as defining &quot;done&quot; from the start, embracing Minimum Viable Product (MVP), time-boxing, and celebrating completions.</li>
<li>The focus is on building habits that increase the likelihood of completing projects, thus fostering real skill growth and reducing the mental weight of unfinished tasks.</li>

<li>Diffusion models and autoregressive models share similarities, with diffusion models performing approximate autoregression in the frequency domain.</li>
<li>Diffusion models generate images from coarse to fine details, analyzed using spectral analysis, showing that natural image spectra follow a power law.</li>
<li>The corruption process in diffusion models filters out high-frequency information, making the generative process similar to autoregression in frequency space, suggesting potential future integration of both paradigms for multimodal data.</li>

<li>The study, published in Nature Neuroscience, showed that the brain can compress up to 15 unrelated experiences into sub-second frames, improving network capacity and efficiency.</li>
<li>Findings revealed a serial position effect, where the first and most recent experiences had the strongest representations, offering insights into memory formation and cognitive processes.</li>

<li>DOjS is a JavaScript programming environment designed for MS-DOS, FreeDOS, or DOS-based Windows, featuring an integrated editor, graphics, sound output, and input support for mouse, keyboard, and joystick.</li>
<li>It offers compatibility with p5js, allowing scripts to be written and run from a DOS command prompt, and supports various multimedia and networking functionalities, including 2D/3D graphics, audio sampling, and IPX/TCP/IP networking.</li>
<li>DOjS can run in DOSBox, real hardware, or virtual machines, requiring at least a 386 with 4MB RAM, though a Pentium class machine with 32MB RAM is recommended for optimal performance.</li>

<li>Lori Emerson&#39;s book, &quot;Other Networks: A Radical Technology Sourcebook,&quot; highlights the largely undocumented history of barbed wire fence telephone networks, which were crucial in rural U.S. and Canada during the early- to mid-20th century.</li>
<li>Barbed wire, initially patented for fencing livestock, was repurposed by farmers for informal telephone networks, especially after the end of Alexander Graham Bell&#39;s patent monopoly in 1893-94, allowing rural communities to communicate without central exchanges or monthly bills.</li>
<li>Despite weather-related issues, these networks thrived and were used into the 1970s, providing essential communication for emergencies, weather updates, and social interaction in cooperative farming areas.</li>

<li>The author shares the bug online due to the lack of a feedback option from Apple, reassuring that the visual distortion is not a vision problem.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author was initially frustrated by an academic paper&#39;s inefficient implementation of their algorithm, leading to incorrect performance claims.</li>
<li>This frustration led to the exploration and optimization of CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types), which enable real-time collaborative editing without a central server.</li>
<li>The author&#39;s optimized CRDT implementation, Diamond, significantly outperforms popular CRDTs like Automerge by using simpler data structures and advanced indexing techniques, achieving over 5000x speed improvements.</li>

<li>Tesla introduced TTPoE (Tesla Transport Protocol over Ethernet) at Hot Chips 2024, aiming to replace TCP for low latency applications in their Dojo supercomputer.</li>
<li>TTPoE offers microsecond-scale latency and hardware offload, simplifying TCP’s state machine to reduce latency and improve data throughput for high IO bandwidth tasks like video training.</li>
<li>TTPoE uses a brute force approach for congestion control, with a 1 MB transmit SRAM buffer and a cost-efficient &quot;Dumb-NIC&quot; called Mojo, designed to enhance the Dojo supercomputer&#39;s performance.</li>

<li>Startup Deep Fission proposes a 30-inch wide nuclear reactor placed a mile underground to address economic and safety issues in nuclear power.</li>
<li>The reactor, based on a conventional pressurized water reactor (PWR), operates at 160 atmospheres and 315 °C (600 °F), using a passive cooling system and the water column&#39;s weight for pressurization.</li>
<li>This design eliminates the need for costly civil engineering and containment structures, and the reactor can be retrieved for inspection or servicing within hours; currently, Deep Fission is in the pre-application review process with the Department of Energy.</li>

<li>Japan is facing rice shortages and rising prices despite normal crop yields due to a long-standing acreage reduction policy aimed at controlling market prices.</li>
<li>This policy, in place for over 50 years, incentivizes farmers to switch to other crops, leading to tightly managed rice production and vulnerability to demand fluctuations.</li>
<li>Experts suggest abolishing the policy, increasing rice production, and boosting exports to enhance food security and benefit consumers.</li>

<li>Telegram’s CEO Pavel Durov was recently arrested by French authorities for insufficient content moderation, highlighting concerns about the platform&#39;s security practices.</li>
<li>Telegram is often labeled as an “encrypted messaging app,” but it does not offer default end-to-end encryption, requiring users to manually activate “Secret Chats” for private conversations, which is not available for group chats.</li>
<li>Despite its growth, Telegram has not improved its encryption usability, and its marketing as a secure messenger is misleading, posing risks to users who believe their conversations are private.</li>

<li>Nunley has completed the lexer and part of the parser, with basic typechecking and code generation, and plans to create a cargo equivalent and establish a process to compile rustc and cargo.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Pavel Durov, founder and CEO of Telegram, was arrested at Le Bourget airport in Paris due to a French search warrant citing serious charges including terrorism, drug trafficking, and more.</li>
<li>French authorities allege that Telegram, under Durov’s leadership, facilitated organized crime through its encrypted messaging services, leading to his detention and potential 20-year prison sentence if convicted.</li>
<li>The arrest has caused a significant impact on Toncoin, Telegram&#39;s associated cryptocurrency, which dropped over 15%, and may influence future regulations on digital platforms and cryptocurrencies.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Defenders often use lists to protect assets, but attackers exploit the interconnected nature of networks, which are better represented as graphs.</li>
<li>Effective defense requires visualizing the network as a graph, reducing unnecessary connections, minimizing admin privileges, using two-factor authentication, and regularly rotating credentials.</li>
<li>Adopting a graph-based mindset helps defenders better protect their networks, as attackers study the real network, not outdated diagrams or incomplete inventories.</li>

<li>Facebook permanently banned a developer for creating &quot;Unfollow Everything,&quot; a tool that helps users unfollow all friends, groups, and pages to reduce time spent on the platform.</li>
<li>The tool received positive feedback for allowing users to enjoy Facebook&#39;s benefits while avoiding its addictive elements, but Facebook issued a cease-and-desist letter and disabled the developer&#39;s accounts.</li>
<li>This ban also disrupted a University of Neuchâtel study on the News Feed&#39;s impact, highlighting how platforms use terms of service to limit user control and suppress empowering tools.</li>
