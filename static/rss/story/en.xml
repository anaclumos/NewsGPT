            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Lord Rayleigh estimated the size of a single molecule using a simple experiment with oil, water, and a pen, inspired by Benjamin Franklin&#39;s observations from the 1770s.</li>
<li>Rayleigh&#39;s calculation of an oil molecule&#39;s length (1.63 nanometers) was remarkably close to modern measurements (1.67 nanometers), demonstrating the power of basic scientific methods.</li>
<li>This historical experiment underscores how straightforward techniques can lead to significant scientific discoveries, as detailed in Charles Tanford&#39;s book, &quot;Ben Franklin Stilled the Waves.&quot;</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>In the mid-1990s, a conservation project in Costa Rica used 12,000 tonnes of waste orange peel to transform a barren pasture into a lush forest.</li>
<li>The project, led by Princeton researchers, was halted due to a lawsuit but rediscovered in 2013, revealing a dense jungle with richer soil and diverse tree species.</li>
<li>The success of this project, published in Restoration Ecology, suggests potential for similar conservation efforts, though the exact mechanisms remain unclear.</li>

<li>Ken Shirriff&#39;s blog post explores ferroelectric RAM (FRAM), a nonvolatile memory technology known for its durability and rapid writing capabilities.</li>
<li>Despite its advantages, FRAM&#39;s high manufacturing costs and complexity have limited its use to niche applications, with Ramtron&#39;s 1999 FRAM chip as a case study.</li>
<li>The blog details the history, structure, and operation of FRAM, noting that while promising, its widespread adoption has been hindered, and Ramtron was eventually acquired by Cypress Semiconductor.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article compares two main types of CO2 sensors: NDIR (Non-Dispersive Infrared) and photo-acoustic sensors, highlighting their performance differences.</li>
<li>NDIR sensors, like the SenseAir S8, are accurate and perform well both indoors and outdoors, while photo-acoustic sensors, such as the Sensirion SCD40/41, are smaller but struggle with outdoor measurements due to environmental variations.</li>
<li>The conclusion suggests that the SenseAir S8 is reliable for all conditions, whereas the Sensirion SCD4x is best suited for indoor use only.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The iPhone 16 introduces JPEG XL, a next-generation image format that offers better quality and smaller file sizes compared to standard JPEGs.</li>
<li>JPEG XL supports wide-gamut and HDR images, offers up to 32 bits per channel, and can reduce file sizes by up to 55% while maintaining visual quality.</li>
<li>Despite its advantages, JPEG XL is not widely adopted yet, with limited support from major browsers, but Apple’s inclusion in the iPhone 16 Pro may encourage broader adoption.</li>

<li>Researchers introduced SCoRe, a multi-turn online reinforcement learning (RL) method to enhance self-correction in large language models (LLMs) using self-generated data.</li>
<li>SCoRe addresses the limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by training under the model&#39;s own distribution, improving self-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% on MATH and HumanEval benchmarks, respectively.</li>
<li>This advancement is significant as it reduces the need for multiple models or external supervision, making self-correction more efficient and effective.</li>

<li>Post-2021 language data is unreliable because of the influx of AI-generated content, which skews word frequencies, such as ChatGPT&#39;s overuse of certain words.</li>
<li>Access to previously free sources like Twitter and Reddit now incurs high costs, and the field of natural language processing (NLP) has shifted focus to generative AI, raising ethical concerns and diminishing interest in traditional text data collection.</li>

<li>The Double Irish Dutch Sandwich, a tax evasion strategy, has largely faded due to changes in tax agreements and reforms.</li>
<li>Irish tax reforms in 2015 and the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made this strategy ineffective, leading to a significant increase in royalty payments from Irish companies to American parent companies.</li>
<li>The shift in royalty payments highlights the ongoing evolution of tax strategies and underscores the costs, including loss of government revenue and diversion of talent to tax evasion.</li>

<li>CoT enables constant-depth transformers to solve inherently serial problems, which are typically challenging for these models, by allowing them to perform computations that would otherwise require deeper architectures.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Google has officially removed cache links, a feature introduced 25 years ago to access saved versions of web pages.</li>
<li>The removal was confirmed by Google’s Search Liaison Danny Sullivan, who cited improved web stability as the reason.</li>
<li>Although users can still view cached pages by typing &quot;cache:&quot; before the URL, this feature will also be phased out, with potential future collaboration with the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine as an alternative.</li>
</ul>

<li>Emily F. Gorcenski has curated and deleted a significant portion of her 40,000 lifetime tweets, inspired by the ethical notion of forgetting and controlling her digital legacy.</li>
<li>The process involved coding a script to expedite deletions, manually preserving tweets of historical value, and dealing with the emotional and physical strain of revisiting past interactions.</li>
<li>Gorcenski has moved on from Twitter to platforms like Bluesky, which offers a more promising environment with open APIs and better moderation tools, while also retiring from activism to focus on personal growth and health.</li>
