<li>The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15, a gaming laptop, uses a thermal interface material (TIM) for cooling, with recent models incorporating liquid metal TIM for better performance.</li>
<li>Liquid metal TIM, while effective, is electrically conductive and can move, posing risks; Asus mitigates this with a silicone seal and foam barrier.</li>
<li>Replacing the liquid metal TIM with Honeywell’s PTM7950 phase-change TIM, which is solid at room temperature and liquifies at operating temperature, resolved thermal throttling issues and improved cooling performance.</li>

<li>Similar practices existed in Denmark with the &quot;plough tax,&quot; and modern democracies face analogous revenue challenges, though they rely on taxes instead of debasement.</li>

<li>A security vendor, ClownStrike, hypothetically disrupts their Windows install base with a faulty update, sparking discussions on the feasibility of disconnecting systems from the internet for security.</li>
<li>Disconnecting systems from the internet is impractical for modern businesses due to the need for real-time communication, maintenance, updates, and monitoring.</li>
<li>Enhancing security within connected environments through restrictive network policies and designing software with offline capabilities is a more effective approach than complete disconnection.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article discusses the challenges of implementing Movable Tree CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) in collaborative environments and how Loro addresses these issues, including sorting child nodes.</li>
<li>Loro&#39;s implementation uses the algorithm from &quot;A highly-available move operation for replicated trees&quot; and integrates the Fractional Index algorithm for sorting, handling conflicts with unique PeerIDs and jitter.</li>
<li>Loro&#39;s approach supports real-time collaboration and historical version checkouts, showing high performance in various scenarios, making it suitable for production use in collaborative applications.</li>
</ul>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>LeanDojo introduces Lean Copilot, enabling Language Models (LLMs) to assist in Lean proof automation by suggesting tactics and searching for proofs.</li>
<li>The ReProver model, using an encoder-decoder Transformer, retrieves premises from the math library and generates the next tactic, outperforming Lean&#39;s built-in proof automation.</li>
<li>LeanDojo&#39;s dataset includes extensive benchmarks and fine-grained annotations, ensuring models can generalize to theorems with novel premises and discover new proofs.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Cloudflare Images&#39; mixed billing model, combining prepaid storage and post-paid delivery, led to unexpectedly high and confusing invoices for EphemeraSearch, sometimes exceeding $400 instead of the expected $110.</li>
<li>Despite multiple contacts with Cloudflare support over eight months, no resolution was provided, prompting a switch to more cost-effective solutions like S3 or dedicated servers.</li>
<li>This experience underscores the importance of efficient spending for indie projects with low revenue, highlighting that while Cloudflare Images offers quality service, its billing model may not be suitable for all users.</li>
</ul>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Fabien Sanglard&#39;s exploration of the Super Nintendo (SNES) video system highlights the design decisions made by Nintendo engineers in 1989 to ensure compatibility with CRT TVs and NTSC standards.</li>
<li>The SNES used a master clock of 21.47727MHz, divided to achieve a dot clock of 5.3693175MHz, resulting in 341 dots per line and a 60.098Hz refresh rate, with horizontal and vertical blanking periods to avoid artifacts.</li>
<li>The SNES supported both NTSC and PAL standards, providing composite and S-Video outputs, and could double vertical and horizontal resolutions for specific applications, despite challenges like flickering.</li>
</ul>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Tools like clang-tidy and PVS-Studio may flag <code>push_back</code> as &quot;bad style&quot; and suggest <code>emplace_back</code>, but this change is not always beneficial.</li>
<li><code>emplace_back</code> should be used to avoid creating temporary objects, but it is not related to move semantics and can still result in copies if not used correctly.</li>
<li>Prefer <code>push_back</code> for simplicity and faster compile times, using <code>emplace_back</code> only when necessary for non-movable types or to avoid temporary objects.</li>
</ul>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Higher-kinded polymorphism, which abstracts over type constructors, is crucial for generic operations over collections and embedding typed Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs).</li>
<li>OCaml doesn&#39;t natively support higher-kinded polymorphism due to type aliasing issues, but it can be simulated using functors, defunctionalization, and initial algebras.</li>
<li>Various methods, including functor abstraction and reducing to ordinary polymorphism, allow achieving higher-kinded polymorphism in OCaml, though sometimes it may not be necessary.</li>
</ul>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Dr. Teresa Belton, an education expert, asserts that allowing children to experience boredom is crucial for fostering creativity, as constant activity can hinder imagination.</li>
<li>Interviews with creatives like author Meera Syal and artist Grayson Perry reveal that boredom played a significant role in their creative development, with Perry describing it as a &quot;creative state.&quot;</li>
<li>Dr. Belton emphasizes that society&#39;s expectation of constant stimulation prevents children from developing internal creativity, advocating for &quot;stand-and-stare&quot; time away from screens to stimulate imagination.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>SD Cards use NAND MLC (Multi-Level Cell) or SLC (Single-Level Cell) flash memory, abstracting complexities like block erases and wear leveling.</li>
<li>The card detects whether to use SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) or SD bus upon voltage supply and initiates the appropriate software stack, completing the boot process when the software enters the transfer state.</li>
<li>A translation layer maps virtual to physical addresses, optimizing write performance with contiguous writes and managing overhead for random writes across Allocation Units (AUs), typically 4MB in size.</li>
</ul>
