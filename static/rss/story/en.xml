<li>The U.S. Copyright Office has ruled that it is legal to repair McDonald&#39;s ice cream machines, marking a victory for the Right to Repair movement.- This decision enables owners to bypass digital locks on commercial food equipment, potentially reducing the need for expensive service calls.- Despite this progress, the ruling does not allow the sharing or selling of repair tools, and broader exemptions for industrial equipment were denied, indicating ongoing challenges in the movement for wider repair rights.</li>

<li>Safety Profiles, introduced in 2015 to enhance memory safety in C++ code, failed due to incorrect assumptions about the sufficiency of existing code information for ensuring safety.- Unlike Rust, which uses lifetime parameters and borrow checking, C++ lacks necessary aliasing, lifetime, and safeness information, making compile-time memory safety unachievable.- The failure of Safety Profiles highlights the need for C++ to adopt explicit aliasing, lifetime, and safeness properties, potentially integrating Rust&#39;s safety model to improve security and interoperability.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The US Federal Aviation Administration mandates that Boeing 787s be rebooted every 51 days to prevent the display of misleading data to pilots.- This directive aims to avert catastrophic failures, such as network switch crashes and the display of stale data affecting critical flight information like airspeed and altitude.- The issue is due to the 787&#39;s common core system failing to filter out stale data after 51 days, necessitating a complete power down of the aircraft before this period is reached; similar problems have been noted in other aircraft, such as the Airbus A350.</li>

<li>The blog post explores the integration of row polymorphism into the Damas-Hindley-Milner type system, specifically within Scrapscript&#39;s Algorithm J, enhancing the system&#39;s ability to handle records.</li>
<li>It introduces rows as a method to model records, mapping names to types and including a &quot;rest&quot; field for additional fields, and discusses the straightforward process of unifying rows by equating types.</li>
<li>The post revisits let polymorphism, which allows functions to be generic over type variables, and notes that Scrapscript avoids handling duplicate labels due to the lack of a masking operation.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Martin Kleppmann criticizes the Redlock algorithm for distributed locking on Redis, highlighting its unsuitability for scenarios demanding correctness due to its dependence on timing assumptions and absence of fencing tokens.</li>
<li>He advises using a single Redis instance for efficiency locks and a consensus system like ZooKeeper for locks requiring correctness, as Redlock&#39;s timing assumptions can lead to vulnerabilities such as network delays and process pauses.</li>
<li>Kleppmann emphasizes the importance of understanding Redis&#39;s limitations and selecting the right tools for specific locking requirements.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Linux kernel&#39;s CPU scheduler is introducing &quot;lazy preemption,&quot; a new concept designed to simplify scheduling and improve system performance.</li>
<li>Lazy preemption aims to replace existing modes PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY with PREEMPT_LAZY, using a new flag, TIF_NEED_RESCHED_LAZY, to allow tasks to run longer unless immediate preemption is necessary.</li>
<li>This change seeks to make the kernel smaller and simpler, with more predictable latencies, though it requires extensive testing and adjustments before full implementation.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The proposal suggests that C++ should officially require an 8-bit byte, aligning with current hardware and software practices.</li>
<li>Historically, the CHAR_BIT macro allowed for varying byte sizes, but most systems and mainstream compilers like GCC, LLVM, and MSVC now use 8-bit bytes by default.</li>
<li>Aligning C++ with the 8-bit byte standard would simplify language and library support, as non-8-bit architectures are mostly irrelevant to modern C++ development.</li>

<li>Cloudflare&#39;s Bot Fight Mode and AI scraper blocking features can inadvertently block legitimate RSS readers, affecting their functionality.- Users can whitelist RSS readers by identifying their user agent or IP address in Cloudflare&#39;s dashboard, though this process is cumbersome and unreliable.- Open RSS, a nonprofit, suggests donations to support their service, highlighting the need for Cloudflare to improve its system to prevent blocking RSS readers.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Two vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-6778 and CVE-2024-5836, were discovered in the Chromium web browser, allowing a sandbox escape from a browser extension and enabling execution of shell commands on a user&#39;s PC.</li>
<li>The vulnerabilities were found in Chromium&#39;s WebUI and enterprise policy systems, involving manipulation of the chrome://policy page and the Browser Switcher feature, as well as bypassing restrictions using the chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow API.</li>
<li>Google classified these vulnerabilities as high severity, rewarded the researcher $20,000, and implemented fixes, emphasizing the need for thorough security checks of old code and undocumented features.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The report is the first public analysis of WeChat&#39;s MMTLS encryption protocol, identifying significant security weaknesses due to custom cryptographic modifications.- Issues such as deterministic Initialization Vectors (IVs) and lack of forward secrecy are highlighted, indicating a failure to adopt cryptographic best practices in Chinese apps.- The authors recommend transitioning to standard encryption protocols like TLS or QUIC+TLS for enhanced security and provide tools and documentation for further research on WeChat&#39;s security.</li>
