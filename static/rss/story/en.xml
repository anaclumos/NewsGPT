<li>In the U.S., police are legally allowed to use deception during interrogations, which has resulted in false confessions and wrongful convictions, as seen in the case of Ted Bradford.</li>
<li>While some states have prohibited lying to juveniles, there is a push for a broader ban on deceptive interrogation tactics, with Washington state considering a bill to make such statements inadmissible in court.</li>
<li>Critics of deception argue it erodes trust, and some countries have adopted alternative methods that focus on building rapport during interrogations.</li>

<li>Virologist Beata Halassy used lab-grown viruses to treat her own breast cancer, raising ethical questions about self-experimentation.</li>
<li>Halassy&#39;s use of oncolytic virotherapy (OVT) with measles and vesicular stomatitis viruses resulted in her tumor shrinking, and she has remained cancer-free for four years.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>SQLite does not perform checksums by default, which means it cannot detect disk corruption, leaving it vulnerable to data issues from even a single bit flip.</li>
<li>Although SQLite uses checksums for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) frames, it ignores corrupt frames without raising errors, potentially leading to undetected data corruption.</li>
<li>The Checksum VFS Shim can be used to add checksum functionality, but it requires a reserve bytes value of exactly 8, limiting its compatibility with certain extensions.</li>

<li>The blog post by Elizabeth Klinc, KE8FMJ, explains WSPR (Weak Signal Propagation Reporter), a protocol for weak-signal radio communication used by amateur radio operators.- WSPR, developed by Joe Taylor, K1JT, allows low-power transmissions to test medium frequency (MF) and high frequency (HF) propagation paths, using a compressed data format with strong error correction.- The post highlights that WSPR operates effectively at low signal-to-noise ratios and requires a radio and a computer with internet access, inviting readers to ask questions and stay updated on amateur radio topics.</li>

<li>The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can truly unlearn unwanted behaviors, such as copyrighted or private content, without retraining.- It reveals that quantization, a process of reducing the precision of a model&#39;s weights, can restore a significant portion of &quot;forgotten&quot; information, with unlearned models retaining up to 83% of forgotten knowledge after 4-bit quantization.- The authors propose a quantization-robust unlearning strategy to effectively address the issue of incomplete unlearning in LLMs.</li>

<li>Kevin Boone highlights the challenges systemd presents for embedded Linux systems, noting its resource-heavy nature compared to traditional alternatives like SystemV init.</li>
<li>Systemd&#39;s components, such as the init process and logging daemon, increase memory usage and boot times, making it less ideal for devices like the Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li>Boone advocates for supporting Linux distributions that do not rely on systemd and developing alternatives to ensure flexibility and effectiveness in embedded environments.</li>

<li>The blog post by Chris Farber examines if Redis is essential for web applications or if PostgreSQL can fulfill the same roles.- It highlights three Redis use cases: job queuing, application locks, and Pub/Sub, and explains how PostgreSQL can manage these tasks using SKIP LOCKED, advisory locks, and LISTEN/NOTIFY statements, respectively.- The discussion suggests that while Redis is superior in caching, PostgreSQL&#39;s capabilities might reduce the need for Redis, potentially lowering operational costs and complexity.</li>

<li>Robert Crumb, an artist known for underground comics, designed the iconic album cover for Janis Joplin&#39;s &quot;Cheap Thrills,&quot; despite not being a fan of the band or psychedelic music.</li>
<li>Crumb&#39;s comic strip design, not initially the first choice, gained legendary status and brought him fame, although he remained critical of the hippie movement.</li>
<li>Despite his success in album art, Crumb preferred the music of the 1920s and 1930s and later played in the Cheap Suit Serenaders Band without pursuing a full music career.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>OpenZFS 2.3.0 introduces &quot;Fast Dedup,&quot; an enhancement over traditional deduplication, addressing high memory usage and performance issues.</li>
<li>Despite improvements, deduplication is not recommended for general-purpose workloads due to overhead and infrequent duplicate blocks; block cloning from OpenZFS 2.2 is a simpler alternative.</li>
<li>Fast Dedup optimizes memory usage and efficiency by refining the deduplication table and adding a deduplication log, but is best for specific workloads with high data duplication.</li>
</ul>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The paper explores how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, typically beneficial for large language models, can actually decrease performance in specific tasks.- It identifies tasks such as implicit statistical learning and visual recognition where verbal thinking, akin to CoT, negatively impacts both human and model performance.- The study links cognitive psychology with CoT evaluations, providing insights into when CoT should be avoided in favor of zero-shot methods, which do not rely on prior examples or reasoning steps.</li>

<li>Independent websites are experiencing a significant decline in visibility on Google search results, despite adhering to guidelines, with Shepherd.com reporting an 86% drop in traffic over 16 months.</li>
<li>This trend is affecting numerous websites, leading to substantial traffic losses and financial difficulties, while other search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo are ranking independent content more favorably.</li>
<li>The call to action is for Google to improve its search engine algorithms and enhance communication with website owners to protect the independent web.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A new experimental proposal suggests that detecting gravitons, the theoretical particles responsible for gravity, might be more achievable than previously believed.</li>
<li>The approach leverages advancements in gravitational wave understanding and quantum technology, potentially enabling detection in a modest laboratory setting within a few years.</li>
<li>Although the experiment may not definitively prove the existence of gravitons, it represents a significant advancement in the study of quantum gravity, similar to how light was shown to be quantized into photons.</li>

<li>Modest Proposals, an activist group, used parody to critique the environmental and human impact of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) industry by creating a satirical fake company, Repaer.- The parody site, which included logos of real LNG companies, faced legal threats from TotalEnergies and Equinor, leading to its temporary removal.- The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) defended the site as noncommercial activism, resulting in the site being moved to a new host, with the companies remaining silent after the pushback.</li>

<li>Probability-generating functions (PGFs) encode sequences of probabilities into a single polynomial, aiding in understanding probability distributions like card draws or coin flips.</li>
<li>PGFs allow for the calculation of expectations and variances through derivatives and can be multiplied to find distributions of sums of independent random variables.</li>
<li>The article also mentions characteristic functions, related to PGFs, which involve complex numbers and have applications in probability theory, though they require advanced analysis for deeper understanding.</li>
