<li>The initiative aims to democratize nanofabrication by creating DIY versions of nanofabrication tools and speeding up integrated circuit prototyping, similar to 3D printing, through open-source hardware.</li>
<li>The project, inspired by Sam Zeloof and started by Elio Bourcart, Alexander Hakim, and Sam Zeloof at Carnegie Mellon University, encourages contributions from individuals without prior nanofabrication experience, using accessible and modifiable low-cost hardware.</li>
<li>The project is supported by a community on Discord, with documentation transitioning to Gitbook, and operates under open-source licenses, including CERN-OHL-W for hardware and MPL v2.0 for software.</li>

<li>Stanford Medicine researchers have created a molecule that induces cancer cell self-destruction by linking two proteins, activating cell death genes.</li>
<li>This innovative method targets diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by connecting the BCL6 protein, which inhibits cell death, to CDK9, an enzyme that triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death).</li>
<li>The research, published in Science, is undergoing further testing in mice and may lead to clinical trials, with funding from institutions like the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the National Institutes of Health.</li>

<li>The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can truly unlearn unwanted behaviors, such as copyrighted or private content, without retraining.- It reveals that quantization, a process of reducing the precision of a model&#39;s weights, can restore a significant portion of &quot;forgotten&quot; information, with unlearned models retaining up to 83% of forgotten knowledge after 4-bit quantization.- The authors propose a quantization-robust unlearning strategy to effectively address the issue of incomplete unlearning in LLMs.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The blog post by Chris Farber examines if Redis is essential for web applications or if PostgreSQL can fulfill the same roles.- It highlights three Redis use cases: job queuing, application locks, and Pub/Sub, and explains how PostgreSQL can manage these tasks using SKIP LOCKED, advisory locks, and LISTEN/NOTIFY statements, respectively.- The discussion suggests that while Redis is superior in caching, PostgreSQL&#39;s capabilities might reduce the need for Redis, potentially lowering operational costs and complexity.</li>

<li>Robert Crumb, an artist known for underground comics, designed the iconic album cover for Janis Joplin&#39;s &quot;Cheap Thrills,&quot; despite not being a fan of the band or psychedelic music.</li>
<li>Crumb&#39;s comic strip design, not initially the first choice, gained legendary status and brought him fame, although he remained critical of the hippie movement.</li>

<li>In 2023, Shopify optimized Ruby&#39;s garbage collector by implementing out-of-band garbage collection to reduce latency, though initial heuristics were not fully effective.- By March 2024, a proof of concept was developed to disable major garbage collections during request cycles, leading to the introduction of a new method, GC.config(rgengc_allow_full_mark: true/false), in Ruby 3.4.0-preview2.- Implementing this method on 50% of Shopify&#39;s servers resulted in significant latency improvements, with modest capacity gains, and future efforts will focus on optimizing minor collections.</li>

<li>Modest Proposals, an activist group, used parody to critique the environmental and human impact of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) industry by creating a satirical fake company, Repaer.- The parody site, which included logos of real LNG companies, faced legal threats from TotalEnergies and Equinor, leading to its temporary removal.- The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) defended the site as noncommercial activism, resulting in the site being moved to a new host, with the companies remaining silent after the pushback.</li>

<li>Google Research engineers have developed a model that converts handwritten photos into digital ink, capturing pen strokes without needing specialized equipment, a process known as derendering.</li>
<li>This method differs from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) by preserving the style and dynamics of handwriting, allowing for editable and realistic digital representations of handwritten notes.</li>
<li>The model uses a multi-task training setup, vision-language model, and data augmentation, making it robust, scalable, and effective without requiring paired training data, with performance comparable to human-generated digital ink.</li>

<li>Cursor, a fork of Visual Studio Code, integrates Large Language Model (LLM) features, offering both free and subscription tiers, with key features like tab completion, inline editing, a chat sidebar, and a composer for cross-codebase refactors.- Tab completion aids in automating repetitive tasks and refactoring, though it may occasionally suggest incorrect completions; inline editing and chat features enhance code modifications.- The .cursorrules file can guide the LLM with coding standards, and Cursor has altered workflows by reducing reliance on external libraries and encouraging the use of unfamiliar languages.</li>

<li>The cr.yp.to blog critiques Meredith Whittaker&#39;s NDSS 2024 talk, which links the liberalization of encryption in 1999 to increased corporate surveillance, by examining historical evidence.</li>
<li>The blog argues that Internet commerce and corporate databases were expanding before 1999, challenging the claim that cryptographic export controls were solely responsible for surveillance issues.</li>
<li>It emphasizes the importance of actively opposing mass surveillance and questions the notion that efforts against one form of surveillance inherently support another.</li>

<li>Setting expectations for software engineers is complex due to diverse company needs, structures, and cultures, requiring managers to align these with new team members.- The concept of &quot;10x engineers&quot; is often misleading, as high output can negatively impact team morale and code quality.- A good engineer is defined by their ability to consistently deliver quality solutions, communicate effectively, understand processes, and adapt to organizational norms, while also having a growth mindset and being a team player.</li>

<li>Microsoft successfully reduced the size of their Javascript monorepo, 1JS, from 178GB to 5GB, a 94% reduction, by addressing inefficiencies in git&#39;s handling of CHANGELOG files.</li>
<li>The solution involved using a new git repack method and configuration, which is now available in Microsoft&#39;s git fork and will be integrated into the upstream git.</li>
<li>This development is significant for those managing large monorepos, as it offers strategies to effectively manage and reduce repository growth.</li>

<li>A previously unknown Chopin waltz has been discovered at the Morgan Library &amp; Museum in New York, marking the first such find in over 50 years.</li>
<li>The manuscript, believed to be from the 1830s, was authenticated by experts and performed by pianist Lang Lang, noted for being shorter and more dynamic than typical Chopin waltzes.</li>
<li>The discovery contributes to Chopin&#39;s legacy, who composed approximately 250 pieces, primarily for solo piano, despite some skepticism in the classical music community.</li>

<li>Open Source software is not a standalone solution to counter Big Tech&#39;s dominance due to its lack of comprehensive support and infrastructure.- Significant investment in support, training, and resources is necessary for Open Source to be effective, as demonstrated by the European Parliament&#39;s unsuccessful attempt with Nextcloud.- Competing with Big Tech requires Open Source to have comparable investment in services and support, emphasizing that successful IT changes need careful planning and resources, regardless of the software&#39;s nature.</li>

<li>The author predicts that by 2024, writing skills will decline significantly due to the increasing reliance on AI for writing tasks, which reduces the necessity for individuals to learn and practice writing.</li>
<li>This decline in writing skills could lead to a societal divide between those who can write and those who cannot, potentially impacting critical thinking abilities, as writing is closely linked to clear and structured thought.</li>
<li>The author warns that, unlike other skills that have become obsolete, writing is essential for critical thinking, and its decline could pose a danger to society by diminishing individuals&#39; ability to think critically.</li>
