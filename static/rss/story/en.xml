      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>g1 is an early prototype using Llama-3.1 70b to enhance large language model (LLM) reasoning through o1-like chains, showing all reasoning tokens and using an open-source model.</li>
<li>The system achieves ~70% accuracy on the Strawberry problem, significantly outperforming Llama-3.1-70b (0%) and ChatGPT-4o (30%) without prompting, by creating dynamic reasoning chains and providing step-by-step logical problem-solving.</li>
<li>The prompt strategy involves instructing the LLM to explain reasoning in JSON format, emphasizing multiple reasoning steps, exploring alternative answers, and re-examining solutions.</li>

<li>Emily F. Gorcenski has curated and deleted a significant portion of her 40,000 lifetime tweets, inspired by the ethical notion of forgetting and controlling her digital legacy.</li>
<li>The process involved coding a script to expedite deletions, manually preserving tweets of historical value, and dealing with the emotional and physical strain of revisiting past interactions.</li>
<li>Gorcenski has moved on from Twitter to platforms like Bluesky, which offers a more promising environment with open APIs and better moderation tools, while also retiring from activism to focus on personal growth and health.</li>

<li>Harvard will still face trial over its handling of the case, despite confirming misconduct by professor Francesca Gino, who is on administrative leave and may lose tenure.</li>
<li>The court ruled that evidence-backed conclusions are not defamation, fully clearing the Data Colada team due to their cautious, evidence-based approach.</li>

<li>Tens of thousands of Boeing machinists voted overwhelmingly to strike after rejecting a contract offer, with 96% support from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751.</li>
<li>The strike, which began outside Boeing’s Washington state plants, could cost the company an estimated $1 billion per week and disrupt its recovery from financial and safety challenges.</li>
<li>Despite a proposed 25% pay increase over four years and enhanced benefits, the deal fell short of other union demands; Boeing is ready to return to negotiations, and the Biden administration is monitoring the situation.</li>

<li>Voyager 1, launched in 1977 and currently 15.14 billion miles from Earth, continues to provide valuable data from beyond the solar system.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated an antitrust trial against Google on September 9, 2024, in Virginia, focusing on Google&#39;s dominance in ad tech.</li>
<li>DOJ lawyer Julia Tarver Wood claimed Google has manipulated ad auctions, resulting in lower earnings for publishers and higher costs for advertisers.</li>
<li>The trial could be more damaging than previous cases, with the DOJ aiming to divest Google&#39;s Ad Manager suite, potentially leading to the separation of Google&#39;s search and advertising businesses.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Gartner&#39;s AI chief Erick Brethenoux claims that AI techniques requiring specialist hardware, such as GPUs, are &quot;doomed&quot; and represent a &quot;brute force&quot; phase that will end as programming techniques improve.</li>
<li>Brethenoux argues that generative AI is overhyped, suitable for only five percent of workloads, and suggests organizations can benefit from AI without relying heavily on it.</li>
<li>Gartner&#39;s Bern Elliot advises against over-relying on generative AI, recommending its use primarily for content generation and conversational interfaces, and suggests using non-generative AI to verify results.</li>

<li>AT Protocol, developed by Bluesky, is designed for open social networking, focusing on decentralized backend engineering.</li>
<li>Traditional web backends face scalability issues with SQL databases, leading to the adoption of NoSQL clusters and stream processing architectures.</li>
<li>AT Protocol decentralizes high-scale backends by using public APIs for internal services and establishing a shared data model called the &quot;user data repository,&quot; which contains cryptographically signed JSON documents.</li>

<li>The article explains the hibernation process in Linux, focusing on version 6.9.9, from initiating hibernation to synchronizing filesystems to disk.</li>
<li>Key entry points for controlling sleep and hibernation modes are <code>/sys/power/state</code> and <code>/sys/power/disk</code>, with specific values written to these files to initiate sleep states.</li>
<li>The hibernation process involves several steps, including kernel configuration, availability checks, compression checks, lock acquisition, console preparation, power management notifications, and filesystem synchronization.</li>

<li>This post is part of a series focused on reducing cognitive load in web projects by using simpler web development practices, specifically HTMX, Raku, and Cro for backend HTML assembly and RESTful APIs, eliminating the need for JavaScript in dynamic content.</li>
<li>HTMX is versatile for most projects but not suitable for complex web apps; Pico CSS is recommended for styling due to its emphasis on semantic HTML, which simplifies the development process.</li>
<li>The post includes code examples using Pico CSS to rebuild HTMX examples for Raku/Cro, with the final code available on GitHub, and highlights Pico CSS&#39;s built-in dark mode.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The paper surveys research on accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) using various hardware accelerators, such as FPGA, ASIC, In-Memory, and GPU.</li>
<li>It compares frameworks based on speedup, energy efficiency, performance (GOPs), and energy efficiency (GOPs/W), addressing the challenge of different process technologies.</li>
<li>The study extrapolates performance and energy efficiency results to the same technology for fair comparison, implementing parts of LLMs on various FPGA chips.</li>

<li>Cosmopolitan Libc enables &quot;compile once, run everywhere&quot; for C++ applications by detecting the host machine at runtime, simplifying cross-platform deployment.</li>
<li>Cristian Adam demonstrated running Qt Creator with Cosmopolitan Libc on macOS and Linux, though faced challenges on Windows, particularly with native platform integration and WebSockets support.</li>
<li>The Cosmopolitan Qt Creator binary is approximately 230 megabytes, and Adam encourages further contributions and issue reporting to enhance support.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Asynchronous IO (non-blocking IO) allows applications to handle many IO operations without blocking the calling OS thread or creating multiple threads, addressing the C10K problem of handling increasing internet traffic.</li>
<li>Despite its benefits, asynchronous IO introduces complexity, especially for operations like file IO on Linux, which always blocks, requiring alternative strategies like io_uring.</li>
<li>The author questions if the focus on asynchronous IO over the past 20 years was a mistake, suggesting that improving OS thread efficiency might have been a better approach, potentially eliminating the need for complex asynchronous IO techniques.</li>

<li>The essay recounts Danny Hillis&#39;s experience working with Richard Feynman on the development of the Connection Machine, a parallel computer with a million processors.</li>
<li>Feynman initially dismissed the idea as &quot;dopey&quot; but became deeply involved, contributing significantly to the project&#39;s technical and organizational aspects.</li>
<li>Feynman&#39;s unique approach, including his analysis of the router and his work on algorithms, showcased his ability to simplify complex problems and make groundbreaking contributions to computer science.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The debate between precise and conservative garbage collection (GC) centers on efficiency and performance, with conservative GC sometimes resulting in faster systems despite common beliefs favoring precise GC.</li>
<li>Conservative GC can avoid run-time overhead, reduce stack frame sizes, and eliminate the need for stack maps, potentially leading to better compiler performance and smaller binaries.</li>
<li>Anecdotal evidence, such as the Conservative Immix paper and practices by Apple’s JavaScriptCore and V8, suggests that conservative stack scanning can outperform precise scanning in certain scenarios.</li>

<li>The author focuses on accessibility and functionality without JavaScript, emphasizing the importance of page load time and HTML minification.</li>
<li>The main challenge is reducing traffic and latency through compression, with Brotli being more efficient but slower than gzip; however, GitHub Pages does not support Brotli.</li>
<li>A potential solution involves using brotli-dec-wasm (200 KB) or tiny-brotli-dec-wasm (71 KiB) for client-side decompression, balancing between gzip (92 KiB) and Brotli (37 + 71 KiB).</li>
