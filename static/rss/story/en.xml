<li>Dan Davies introduces the concept of &quot;accountability sinks,&quot; where organizations obscure the consequences of decisions, making it difficult to hold anyone accountable.- These accountability sinks are prevalent in industries like hospitality, health insurance, airlines, and government agencies, where decision origins become unclear, breaking feedback loops.- The use of AI can worsen accountability sinks by further obscuring responsibility, highlighting the need for new strategies to ensure organizations remain accountable for their decisions.</li>

<li>The study &quot;QUIC is not Quick Enough over Fast Internet&quot; reveals that QUIC&#39;s data rate can be up to 45.2% lower than the traditional TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 on high-speed networks.- The performance gap between QUIC and TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 increases with higher bandwidth, impacting file transfers, video streaming, and web browsing.- The paper identifies high receiver-side processing overhead as the root cause, due to excessive data packets and user-space acknowledgments (ACKs) in QUIC, and provides recommendations for improvement.</li>

<li>Martin Kleppmann criticizes the Redlock algorithm for distributed locking on Redis, highlighting its unsuitability for scenarios demanding correctness due to its dependence on timing assumptions and absence of fencing tokens.</li>
<li>He advises using a single Redis instance for efficiency locks and a consensus system like ZooKeeper for locks requiring correctness, as Redlock&#39;s timing assumptions can lead to vulnerabilities such as network delays and process pauses.</li>
<li>Kleppmann emphasizes the importance of understanding Redis&#39;s limitations and selecting the right tools for specific locking requirements.</li>

<li>The Linux kernel&#39;s CPU scheduler is introducing &quot;lazy preemption,&quot; a new concept designed to simplify scheduling and improve system performance.</li>
<li>Lazy preemption aims to replace existing modes PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY with PREEMPT_LAZY, using a new flag, TIF_NEED_RESCHED_LAZY, to allow tasks to run longer unless immediate preemption is necessary.</li>
<li>This change seeks to make the kernel smaller and simpler, with more predictable latencies, though it requires extensive testing and adjustments before full implementation.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Why don't we use awnings anymore (2022)]]></title>
            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Awnings were historically used to block solar heat gain, providing passive heating in winter and cooling in summer, but fell out of favor with the advent of air conditioning in the mid-20th century.</li>
<li>The decline in awning use was due to low energy costs and a focus on insulation, leading to their current use primarily for signage and patio coverings.</li>
<li>Rising energy prices may lead to a resurgence in awning popularity as a cost-effective method to reduce heating and cooling expenses.</li>

<li>The project is based on a 2014 paper by Yue et al., and the code is available under the MIT license, encouraging others to create their own versions.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Eating less can lead to a longer life: study in mice shows why]]></title>
            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A comprehensive study on nearly 1,000 mice indicates that reduced calorie intake can extend lifespan, but not primarily due to weight loss or metabolic changes.- The research found that factors such as immune health, genetics, and stress resilience are more crucial in determining lifespan extension than metabolic improvements.- This study challenges the traditional belief that metabolic changes directly correlate with longer life, emphasizing the complexity of dietary restriction&#39;s impact on longevity.</li>

<li>The 1/8th Sleep is a DIY project that serves as a cost-effective alternative to the expensive Eight Sleep self-cooling mattress.- The homemade cooling system costs $382 and includes a mattress topper, fish tank cooler, pump, and smart plug, offering customization options like adding ice for extra cooling.- While it lacks the aesthetics, heating capability, and built-in sleep tracking of the Eight Sleep, the author uses an Apple Watch for sleep tracking, making it suitable for those with a DIY mindset.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[The Quiet Art of Attention]]></title>
            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The concept of attention emphasizes controlling the mind by focusing on the present and observing thoughts without judgment, which leads to intentional responses rather than impulsive reactions.</li>
<li>Lasting change is achieved through small, deliberate actions rather than dramatic shifts, promoting clarity, peace, and freedom.</li>
<li>Mindful engagement, akin to tending a garden, enriches experiences and slows the perception of time, encouraging a focus on what truly matters.</li>
</ul>
