<li>The study by Hunter Ng investigates &quot;ghost hiring,&quot; where employers post job ads without the intention of filling them, using data from Glassdoor and LLM-BERT analysis.- It reveals that up to 21% of job ads could be ghost jobs, particularly in specialized industries and larger companies, contributing to job market issues such as the Beveridge Curve disconnect.- The study suggests that policymakers should address ghost hiring as it leads to job fatigue and distorts market signals.</li>

<li>Shae and collaborator mclare faced technical challenges but calculated a truck factor of 12 for the Linux kernel, suggesting a decline from the original study&#39;s 80, indicating bus factors have worsened over time.</li>

<li>MIT engineers found that exercise aids nerve healing by releasing myokines during muscle contractions, which significantly promote neuron growth.- Neurons exposed to myokines grew four times farther than those not exposed, and physical stretching of neurons also stimulated growth, mimicking muscle contractions.- The study suggests exercise-related therapies could be crucial for nerve repair, potentially leading to treatments for nerve injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.</li>

<li>Parts produced using the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process exhibit anisotropic strength due to imperfect layer adhesion, affecting their structural integrity.- An expired Stratasys patent from 1997 provides a method to mitigate this issue, yet it has not been adopted in open-source slicers despite being in the public domain since 2017.- A 2023 patent appears to replicate the 1997 claims, potentially granted in error, highlighting an opportunity to enhance print strength for users.</li>

<li>A study from Australia and the Netherlands indicates that prolonged standing may be as detrimental as sitting all day, both elevating the risk of circulatory diseases.- Analysis of data from 83,013 adults found no correlation between standing time and decreased cardiovascular disease risk, with standing over two hours daily increasing risk by 11% per additional half hour.- The study highlights the necessity of integrating movement into daily routines, as merely standing is not an effective remedy for sedentary lifestyles.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>SQLite does not perform checksums by default, which means it cannot detect disk corruption, leaving it vulnerable to data issues from even a single bit flip.</li>
<li>Although SQLite uses checksums for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) frames, it ignores corrupt frames without raising errors, potentially leading to undetected data corruption.</li>
<li>The Checksum VFS Shim can be used to add checksum functionality, but it requires a reserve bytes value of exactly 8, limiting its compatibility with certain extensions.</li>

<li>The author self-published a book on Web Typography, with the ebook version achieving greater success than the physical copies.- The author attempted to replicate the print design in the ebook using HTML and CSS but faced rendering issues in Apple Books, particularly with headings being separated from their paragraphs.- Despite existing CSS solutions for such issues, browser support is inadequate, especially in Safari and Firefox, and the annual Interop arrangement for browser priorities did not select breaking controls for 2024, highlighting the need for better typographic support in ebooks.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>FFmpeg developers have achieved up to 94 times performance improvements by using handwritten AVX-512 assembly code, enhancing video processing speeds significantly.</li>
<li>This optimization is beneficial for users with AVX-512-capable hardware, such as AMD&#39;s Ryzen 9000-series CPUs, although Intel&#39;s recent processors have AVX-512 disabled.</li>
<li>The FFmpeg project highlights the potential of hand-optimized assembly code in performance-critical applications, despite ongoing debates about its relevance.</li>

<li>The initiative aims to democratize nanofabrication by creating DIY versions of nanofabrication tools and speeding up integrated circuit prototyping, similar to 3D printing, through open-source hardware.</li>
<li>The project, inspired by Sam Zeloof and started by Elio Bourcart, Alexander Hakim, and Sam Zeloof at Carnegie Mellon University, encourages contributions from individuals without prior nanofabrication experience, using accessible and modifiable low-cost hardware.</li>
<li>The project is supported by a community on Discord, with documentation transitioning to Gitbook, and operates under open-source licenses, including CERN-OHL-W for hardware and MPL v2.0 for software.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A study led by Ben-Gurion University underscores the significance of blood sugar control in decelerating brain aging, highlighting the Mediterranean diet&#39;s benefits.- The DIRECT PLUS Brain MRI trial found that better blood sugar levels correlate with positive changes in brain regions impacted by aging, suggesting dietary changes could mitigate cognitive decline.- The research involved 300 participants over 18 months, using MRI to monitor brain health, and found that the Green Mediterranean diet, high in polyphenols, may support brain health and reduce age-related cognitive decline.</li>

<li>A new static web app, IMDb SQL Best Movie Finder, has been developed, enabling users to query a database of 1.5 million IMDb titles using SQL directly in their browser.- The app operates entirely on the client-side, meaning all data processing occurs locally on the user&#39;s machine, enhancing privacy and performance.- This tool is significant for users interested in exploring IMDb data without server-side dependencies, offering a unique and efficient way to interact with large datasets.</li>
