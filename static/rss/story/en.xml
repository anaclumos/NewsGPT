<li>Scientists at the University of Rochester Medical Center have restored the brain&#39;s waste-clearing process in aging mice, potentially offering new treatments for Alzheimer&#39;s and Parkinson&#39;s using existing drugs.</li>
<li>The research, published in Nature Aging, demonstrates that restoring cervical lymph vessel function can significantly improve the brain&#39;s ability to remove toxic waste, which slows with age.</li>
<li>The team used prostaglandin F2α, a drug aiding smooth muscle contraction, to revive the lymphatic system in older mice, enhancing cerebrospinal fluid flow and waste removal to levels seen in younger mice.</li>

<li>Google has transitioned Chrome&#39;s extension support from Manifest V2 to V3, disabling the popular ad blocker uBlock Origin for over 30 million users.</li>
<li>The new policy, aimed at enhancing security, prevents extensions from using remotely hosted code, but users can temporarily enable uBlock Origin via settings before it is fully disabled.</li>
<li>A new version, uBlock Origin Lite, complies with Manifest V3 but lacks some features of the original, prompting users to consider switching browsers or finding alternative ad blockers.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Efficient and accurate filtering of polygonal shapes can be achieved using closed-form solutions based on Green&#39;s theorem with piecewise-polynomial filters, such as box, bilinear, and bicubic.</li>
<li>This method involves breaking polygons into smaller clipped polygons and evaluating the filter integral directly, which can be implemented on the GPU, as demonstrated in WebGPU.</li>
<li>Alpenglow provides CPU and WebGPU implementations for hierarchically clipping polygons into smaller pieces, facilitating efficient rasterization and reducing visual artifacts in anti-aliasing.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Syndicated Actor model addresses challenges in programming interactive systems by integrating Actors with Tuplespace-like shared state and using eventually-consistent state replication.</li>
<li>The Syndicate Domain-Specific Language (DSL) extends programming languages to express syndicated actor and conversational concurrency concepts, emphasizing secure state replication and observation using object capabilities and Macaroons.</li>
<li>This model and DSL aim to improve upon existing models like Actors, Tuplespaces, and Publish/Subscribe by offering better fault-tolerance, consistency, and support for stateful conversations.</li>

<li>The federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that geofence warrants are &quot;categorically prohibited by the Fourth Amendment,&quot; aligning with the EFF&#39;s arguments against general, exploratory searches.</li>
<li>The case, United States v. Smith, involved police using a geofence warrant to obtain location data from Google during a 2018 armed robbery investigation, which the court found violated individuals&#39; reasonable expectation of privacy.</li>
<li>Despite ruling geofence warrants unconstitutional, the court allowed the evidence in this case due to police reliance on the technology in good faith, emphasizing the need for strict Fourth Amendment protections.</li>

<li>The post demonstrates how to generate an example of Simpson&#39;s Paradox using the Z3 Theorem Prover, a tool for solving logical formulas.</li>
<li>Simpson&#39;s Paradox is illustrated with a baseball scenario where one player has a better overall batting average, but the other player has better averages against both left-handed and right-handed pitchers.</li>
<li>The key insight is that the players faced different sets of pitchers, which explains the paradoxical results.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>π² (approximately 9.87) and the acceleration due to gravity, g (9.81 m/s²), are intriguingly close in value, but not exactly equal.</li>
<li>The discrepancy arises from historical changes in the definition of the meter, which has evolved from human-based measurements to a precise scientific standard based on the speed of light.</li>
<li>The near-equality of π² and g is not a mere coincidence but a result of historical and scientific developments in measurement standards.</li>

<li>A Subaru Crosstrek owner received a warning for driving on a 4WD-only road in Canyonlands National Park, highlighting the difference between AWD and 4WD.</li>
<li>AWD is suitable for light off-roading but lacks the off-road traction of 4WD systems with locking differentials, which are necessary for challenging trails.</li>
<li>The National Park Service enforces these restrictions to ensure visitor safety, with penalties for violations including fines up to $5,000 and imprisonment.</li>

<li>Base 3 computing, or ternary, uses three digits (0, 1, 2) and is more efficient than binary, as two ternary &quot;trits&quot; can represent nine numbers compared to four numbers by two binary bits.</li>
<li>Ternary computing has a lower radix economy for large numbers, making it the most economical integer base, and can answer questions with three possible outcomes, reducing the number of queries needed.</li>
<li>Despite its efficiency, ternary computing never gained widespread use due to the dominance of binary hardware and software, but recent advancements suggest potential applications in cybersecurity with lower error rates.</li>

<li>The astronauts&#39; stay at the International Space Station (ISS) could extend into next year, with NASA considering launching the next Crew Dragon with only two astronauts to accommodate Williams and Wilmore for a six-month stay.</li>
<li>Boeing has faced multiple setbacks with the Starliner program, including a $125 million write-off, and NASA&#39;s decision on the matter is expected by mid-August, with the Crew Dragon launch delayed to no earlier than Sept. 24.</li>

<li>The Kubernetes PersistentVolume (PV) controller code is intentionally verbose and follows a &quot;space shuttle style&quot; to ensure every condition is accounted for, similar to NASA&#39;s coding practices.</li>
<li>This design emphasizes the bi-directional relationship between PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), which is crucial for maintaining consistent behavior in a transactionless system.</li>
<li>The code includes detailed comments and explicit branches to help future maintainers understand the complexities of the binding behavior, ensuring robust and reliable volume management.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Oroville Dam spillway damage in 2017 highlighted the importance of effective drainage systems to prevent structural damage from water pressure.</li>
<li>French drains, named after Henry French, are subsurface systems using gravel-filled trenches and perforated pipes to manage water flow and prevent soil erosion.</li>
<li>Properly designed French drains use filters like geotextile fabric to prevent clogging and are crucial for structures such as dams, retaining walls, and agricultural fields.</li>
</ul>

<li>In April 2024, the Phylum Research Team identified a surge of spam packages in npm linked to the Tea protocol, which rewards developers in cryptocurrency for open-source contributions.</li>
<li>Approximately 70% of new npm packages published between February and August 2024 were identified as Tea-related spam, posing risks such as skewed AI training and obscured malicious packages.</li>
<li>Despite efforts by the Tea protocol and npm to address the issue, the rate of spam package publication remains high, prompting ongoing research and mitigation efforts by Phylum.</li>

<li>Uber tests its payment systems directly in production to catch unknown issues quickly, a method that contrasts with the more common use of staging environments.</li>
<li>This approach involves incremental rollouts in small, representative regions and uses tools like Cerberus and Deputy for transparency and monitoring.</li>
<li>Uber&#39;s strategy focuses on resilience and quick rollbacks, ensuring high-quality software by addressing real-world issues, as demonstrated by their successful GooglePay rollout in Portugal.</li>

<li>DigiCert identified a DNS-based validation issue with CNAME records lacking an underscore prefix, potentially leading to certificate mis-issuance, affecting 83,267 certificates and 6,807 subscribers.</li>
<li>The root cause was a system update error due to siloed teams and insufficient compliance checks; immediate actions included revoking all affected certificates and planning to open-source their domain validation system.</li>
<li>As a result, DigiCert&#39;s compliance head resigned, and a task force was established to enhance technical compliance controls.</li>
