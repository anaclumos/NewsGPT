<li>Meta&#39;s FAIR team has introduced SAM 2, an advanced model for visual segmentation in both images and videos, extending the capabilities of the original SAM model.</li>
<li>SAM 2 employs a transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time processing and includes a model-in-the-loop data engine, resulting in the creation of the SA-V dataset, the largest video segmentation dataset to date.</li>
<li>The model demonstrates strong performance across various tasks and domains, with different configurations available, such as sam2_hiera_tiny and sam2_hiera_large, each offering varying levels of performance and speed.</li>

<li>On July 19, 2024, a CrowdStrike software update caused the largest IT outage in history, impacting 8.5 million Windows computers, including critical systems in hospitals, banks, and airlines.</li>
<li>The outage led to a significant reduction in air traffic for major airlines, with Delta experiencing a 46% reduction in flights, United 36%, and American 16%, while Southwest Airlines remained unaffected.</li>
<li>The prolonged recovery for Delta was due to the absence of a proper disaster recovery plan, highlighting the importance of robust contingency strategies in mitigating such disruptions.</li>

<li>Tools like clang-tidy and PVS-Studio may flag <code>push_back</code> as &quot;bad style&quot; and suggest <code>emplace_back</code>, but this change is not always beneficial.</li>
<li><code>emplace_back</code> should be used to avoid creating temporary objects, but it is not related to move semantics and can still result in copies if not used correctly.</li>
<li>Prefer <code>push_back</code> for simplicity and faster compile times, using <code>emplace_back</code> only when necessary for non-movable types or to avoid temporary objects.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Higher-kinded polymorphism, which abstracts over type constructors, is crucial for generic operations over collections and embedding typed Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs).</li>
<li>OCaml doesn&#39;t natively support higher-kinded polymorphism due to type aliasing issues, but it can be simulated using functors, defunctionalization, and initial algebras.</li>
<li>Various methods, including functor abstraction and reducing to ordinary polymorphism, allow achieving higher-kinded polymorphism in OCaml, though sometimes it may not be necessary.</li>

<li>Dr. Teresa Belton, an education expert, asserts that allowing children to experience boredom is crucial for fostering creativity, as constant activity can hinder imagination.</li>
<li>Interviews with creatives like author Meera Syal and artist Grayson Perry reveal that boredom played a significant role in their creative development, with Perry describing it as a &quot;creative state.&quot;</li>
<li>Dr. Belton emphasizes that society&#39;s expectation of constant stimulation prevents children from developing internal creativity, advocating for &quot;stand-and-stare&quot; time away from screens to stimulate imagination.</li>

<li>Intel&#39;s hyper-threading is a form of SMT, duplicating processor architecture state to make one physical processor appear as two logical processors to the operating system.</li>

<li>SQLite reads and writes small blobs (e.g., thumbnail images) 35% faster than using individual files on disk, and uses about 20% less disk space.</li>
<li>The efficiency is attributed to fewer open() and close() system calls and tighter data packing, with performance expected to improve in future versions.</li>
<li>Tests show SQLite generally outperforms direct file I/O, especially on Windows with anti-virus software enabled, though performance can vary based on hardware and OS.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Intel’s 13th and 14th Gen CPUs have a crashing issue due to elevated voltages and manufacturing defects, which cannot be fixed if damage has already occurred.</li>
<li>A patch to prevent future issues is expected in mid-August, but damaged CPUs will need to be replaced; Intel will not recall or extend warranties.</li>
<li>Affected users should update their BIOS and contact Intel Customer Support, as the issue potentially affects any 13th or 14th Gen desktop processor consuming 65W or more power.</li>

<li>A Type 1 diabetic developed a Windows Forms application with OxyPlot charts to better visualize and manage insulin and carbohydrate intake.</li>
<li>The individual used GeneticSharp, a genetic algorithm library, to optimize insulin dosages, successfully stabilizing glucose levels.</li>
<li>The approach shows promise for personalized diabetes management, though further simulation and adjustments for long-acting insulin are needed.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Google is now the only search engine that can display recent Reddit results, making Reddit content exclusive to Google.</li>
<li>Other search engines like Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Qwant cannot show recent Reddit results, with DuckDuckGo providing limited links without descriptions.</li>
<li>This situation underscores Google&#39;s near monopoly on search, affecting competition and drawing criticism over search quality, with speculation of a multi-million dollar deal allowing Google to scrape Reddit for AI training.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Travelers can opt out of airport facial recognition by standing away from the camera, presenting their ID, and stating, “I opt out of biometrics.”</li>
<li>The Algorithmic Justice League’s “Freedom Flyers” campaign aims to raise awareness of this right, especially as TSA plans to expand facial recognition to all US airports.</li>
<li>Facial recognition poses risks such as data breaches, misidentification, AI bias, and the normalization of surveillance, with significant privacy concerns over the retention and use of biometric data.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The DEA and TSA have been collaborating to seize travelers&#39; money by targeting those carrying large amounts of cash, using informers and TSA checkpoints to identify individuals and claiming they &quot;consent&quot; to searches.</li>
<li>This practice, which extends to Amtrak trains with the help of US Customs and Border Protection, involves &quot;civil forfeiture&quot; where money is seized without a warrant, often ignoring passengers&#39; refusal to consent.</li>
<li>An ongoing class-action lawsuit highlights the frequency of these illegal searches, with plaintiffs arguing that the volume of records indicates a systemic issue, despite the DEA and TSA&#39;s resistance to disclosing these records.</li>

<li>EMACS, a text editor, was developed at the MIT AI Lab in 1976, with Richard Stallman (RMS) becoming the main developer by the end of that year.</li>
<li>RMS named &quot;E&quot; and &quot;EMACS&quot; and played a crucial role in transforming TECO macros into a powerful editor, with initial help from Guy Steele, David Moon, and John Kulp.</li>
<li>The early user community, including Moon, contributed to key bindings and command names, highlighting the collaborative and community-driven nature of EMACS&#39;s development.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Researchers face challenges in publishing null results, which show no significant relationship between variables, leading to a bias favoring positive findings.</li>
<li>This publication bias distorts the scientific record and wastes resources, as seen in evolutionary biologist Natalie Pilakouta&#39;s inconclusive study on fish preferences in Iceland&#39;s hot springs.</li>
<li>Efforts to address this issue include journals encouraging pre-registered reports, but slow adoption and the perception that null results indicate flawed research remain significant hurdles.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>MPPP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-4-propionoxypiperidine) is a designer drug first reported in 1947, intended as a painkiller but found to be no better than existing options.</li>
<li>In 1976, Barry Kidston synthesized MPPP and developed Parkinson’s-like symptoms due to an impurity, MPTP, which selectively kills cells crucial for motor control.</li>
<li>The 1982 outbreak of Parkinson’s symptoms linked to MPTP-contaminated synthetic heroin led to significant scientific insights into Parkinson’s disease and highlighted the dangers of amateur drug synthesis.</li>

<li>Micromouse is a robotics competition where small autonomous robots solve a 16×16 maze, originating in the late 1970s and popular in several countries including the UK, U.S., and Japan.</li>
<li>Robots use algorithms like Bellman flood-fill, Dijkstra&#39;s, and A* for navigation, with top speeds exceeding three meters per second; the current world record is 3.921 seconds by Ng Beng Kiat.</li>
<li>Recent advancements include using fans for additional downforce, enabling accelerations over 2.5g, and a variant called Half-Size Micromouse uses a 32×32 maze with smaller dimensions.</li>
