            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The GPU market has experienced a significant price drop, with H100 GPUs decreasing from $8/hr to under $2/hr due to oversupply and changing demand dynamics.- Factors contributing to this shift include reserved compute resales, open model fine-tuning, and a reduction in new foundation model companies, making renting GPUs more favorable than purchasing.- The emergence of open-weight models and more affordable alternatives, such as AMD and Intel GPUs, is influencing the market, with a growing emphasis on AI inference and fine-tuning, supported by platforms like Featherless.AI offering cost-effective AI solutions.</li>

<li>Malte Skarupke discusses his experience learning CUDA, noting that it is essentially C++ with additional features for parallel computing.</li>
<li>Key lessons for optimizing CUDA performance include memory coalescing, understanding various memory types, and maximizing parallelism by using many threads and separating tasks into different kernels.</li>
<li>Skarupke emphasizes that writing CUDA is akin to solving a puzzle, where the primary focus should be on running tasks in parallel before optimizing for speed.</li>

<li>Despite Rust&#39;s excellent tooling, the author is cautious about investing in it for personal projects, though they might consider it for single-threaded C replacements.</li>

<li>The post explores the computational view of time, suggesting that time is the universe&#39;s ongoing computation, and due to computational irreducibility, we cannot predict the future or &quot;jump ahead&quot; in time.</li>
<li>It discusses how our perception of time as linear is due to our computational limits, while fundamentally, time may be multithreaded, and our experience is shaped by our bounded exploration of the ruliad, a concept representing the entangled limit of all computations.</li>
<li>The conclusion challenges traditional concepts like time travel, aligning the computational view of time with the Second Law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or disorder, tends to increase over time.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The CAP Theorem in distributed systems posits that a system can only achieve two out of three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.- Consistency ensures that any read after a write returns the latest value, Availability guarantees responses from non-failing nodes, and Partition Tolerance allows operation despite network message losses.- The theorem, proven by Gilbert and Lynch, demonstrates that a system cannot maintain all three properties simultaneously, as network partitions can lead to inconsistencies.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Agbogbloshie Scrapyard in Accra, Ghana, was a major site for processing e-waste, handling 15,000 tons annually, and attracting workers like Emmanuel Akatire seeking economic opportunities despite health risks.</li>
<li>A photojournalism project titled &quot;E-Waste in Ghana: Tracing Transboundary Flows&quot; sheds light on the dual nature of e-waste as both a danger and an economic opportunity, highlighting the informal recycling economies and the exposure to harmful chemicals faced by workers.</li>
<li>The project aims to raise awareness about the global e-waste issue, emphasizing the impact on communities and the challenges posed by lax enforcement of international laws against non-functional e-waste trafficking.</li>

<li>htmx is presented as a simpler alternative to complex single-page applications (SPAs) like those built with React, combining elements of traditional multi-page and single-page apps to create hypermedia-driven applications.</li>
<li>The author built a todo list app using htmx and service workers, which allows for offline functionality and persistent data storage via IndexedDB, though it faces challenges like limited developer tool support and ES module compatibility issues in Firefox.</li>
<li>While htmx facilitates dynamic content loading and interaction, it is not essential for fully client-side apps, where frameworks like React might offer more straightforward data and UI synchronization.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Cloudflare successfully defended itself against Sable Networks, a company often labeled as a &quot;patent troll,&quot; which sued Cloudflare in 2021 over outdated patents.</li>
<li>Unlike other companies that settled, Cloudflare contested the lawsuit and won, invalidating Sable&#39;s patent by demonstrating prior art.</li>
<li>As a result, Sable agreed to pay Cloudflare $225,000, provide a royalty-free license, and abandon its patents, showcasing Cloudflare&#39;s dedication to challenging baseless patent claims.</li>

<li>Private equity firms have acquired numerous American emergency rooms, focusing on profit maximization at the expense of patient care quality.- This acquisition has led to reduced doctor hours, increased patient costs, and pressured doctors to make quick, potentially harmful decisions.- Although the No Surprises Act was introduced to shield patients from unexpected bills, existing loopholes necessitate patients to be informed about their rights and opt for in-network care.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The U.S. Department of Energy is investing $1.5 billion to improve electric grid reliability, funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</li>
<li>This investment will support four transmission projects, adding nearly 1,000 miles of new transmission lines and 7,100 megawatts of capacity across several states, creating 9,000 jobs.</li>
<li>A National Transmission Planning study indicates that expanding the transmission system could result in savings of $270 billion to $490 billion by 2050.</li>

<li>The Kekz Headphones use chips called &quot;Kekz&quot; or &quot;Cookies&quot; to play audio stories without requiring an internet connection.</li>
<li>A reverse-engineering effort revealed that the headphones contain a Jieli chip, NFC reader, and an SD card with encrypted files, allowing for the cloning of cookies and decryption of content.</li>
<li>The accompanying app collects user data, including geolocation, without transparent disclosure, and the company has not responded to security concerns raised by the researcher.</li>

<li>Excessive screen time, defined as more than two hours daily outside of work, can negatively impact adult brain health, causing issues like eye strain, neck pain, and mental health problems.- Studies indicate that it may lead to thinning of the cerebral cortex, reduced gray matter volume, hindered sleep, and increased risk of brain-related diseases such as dementia.- Experts advise minimizing screen time, particularly in the morning, and suggest engaging in activities like exercise, social interaction, and stress management to promote brain health.</li>

<li>Researchers from Poland and the UK have developed MiraGe, a novel image editing system that uses Gaussian Splatting to convert 2D image parts into 3D space for manipulation.</li>
<li>Unlike generative AI models such as Adobe&#39;s Firefly, MiraGe employs Gaussian Mesh Splatting (GaMeS) instead of Latent Diffusion Models, enabling detailed and flexible edits by interpreting images as CGI meshes.</li>
<li>MiraGe integrates with Blender and uses external physics engines for realistic transformations, outperforming previous methods in image quality tests, and its full code is accessible on GitHub.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Juno for YouTube, a web view app that modified YouTube&#39;s website for a &quot;visionOS&quot; look, was removed from the App Store on October 1, 2024, due to guideline violations claimed by YouTube.</li>
<li>The app&#39;s removal was a result of unresolved disagreements between the developer and YouTube, with no plans for further escalation from the developer.</li>
<li>Existing users can continue using Juno until potential future updates from YouTube render it non-functional, and the developer expressed gratitude for the support from Vision Pro users.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author discusses the challenge of reducing the default installation size of NixOS, a server operating system, which initially takes up about 900MB of disk space.- Efforts to minimize NixOS involved removing unnecessary components like Nix, Perl, Python, and certain services, achieving a reduction of approximately 300MB.- Despite these reductions, the author concludes that creating a minimal NixOS system is complex and suggests that a dedicated &quot;fork&quot; of NixOS for server scenarios might be more effective.</li>
