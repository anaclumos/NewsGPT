<li>Shipping projects in big tech involves more than just coding; it requires prioritization, comprehensive understanding, and effective communication.</li>
<li>Successful project shipping demands anticipating problems, creating fallback plans, and deploying early and often to identify issues.</li>
<li>The ultimate goal of shipping is to satisfy company leadership, requiring courage, focus, and maintaining leadership trust.</li>

<li>YubiKey is allegedly selling older stock with firmware susceptible to the EUCLEAK attack, rather than discarding them, as reported by a reader of Fefe&#39;s Blog.</li>
<li>The EUCLEAK attack is a security vulnerability that could potentially compromise the integrity of the YubiKey devices.</li>

<li>Despite the widespread integration of digital devices in classrooms, the anticipated academic improvements have not been realized, with global test scores in math, science, and reading declining.- Studies indicate that frequent computer use in schools often leads to poorer learning outcomes, primarily due to the encouragement of multitasking, which hinders effective learning.- Some regions, such as Europe and Southeast Asia, are shifting back to traditional teaching methods, suggesting that American schools might also benefit from reducing digital reliance in education.</li>

<li>Shae Erisson&#39;s blog explores a GitHub plugin concept to calculate a project&#39;s &quot;bus factor,&quot; which indicates how many team members can leave before a project is jeopardized.</li>
<li>The idea was inspired by a 2015 layoff experience, but there are concerns it could be misused by management to identify expendable employees.</li>
<li>Shae and collaborator mclare faced technical challenges but calculated a truck factor of 12 for the Linux kernel, suggesting a decline from the original study&#39;s 80, indicating bus factors have worsened over time.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>MIT engineers found that exercise aids nerve healing by releasing myokines during muscle contractions, which significantly promote neuron growth.- Neurons exposed to myokines grew four times farther than those not exposed, and physical stretching of neurons also stimulated growth, mimicking muscle contractions.- The study suggests exercise-related therapies could be crucial for nerve repair, potentially leading to treatments for nerve injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.</li>

<li>Apple initially refused a refund or replacement, citing Uber&#39;s confirmation of delivery, leading the customer to file a police report and contact Apple again.</li>
<li>After escalating the issue by emailing Apple&#39;s CEO, a team member began investigating, but Apple Retail Executive Relations maintained their decision, prompting the customer to pursue a chargeback.</li>

<li>&quot;Grim Fandango,&quot; developed by Tim Schafer at LucasArts and released in 1998, is notable for its unique combination of Mexican folklore and film noir aesthetics, along with its engaging story and characters.- The game faced criticism for its complex puzzles and awkward controls, which affected the overall gameplay experience, despite being developed with the new 3D engine, GrimE.- Although the 2015 remastered version addressed some gameplay issues, the original&#39;s flaws highlight the challenges faced by adventure games during their decline in popularity.</li>

<li>The initiative aims to democratize nanofabrication by creating DIY versions of nanofabrication tools and speeding up integrated circuit prototyping, similar to 3D printing, through open-source hardware.</li>
<li>The project, inspired by Sam Zeloof and started by Elio Bourcart, Alexander Hakim, and Sam Zeloof at Carnegie Mellon University, encourages contributions from individuals without prior nanofabrication experience, using accessible and modifiable low-cost hardware.</li>
<li>The project is supported by a community on Discord, with documentation transitioning to Gitbook, and operates under open-source licenses, including CERN-OHL-W for hardware and MPL v2.0 for software.</li>

<li>A study led by Ben-Gurion University underscores the significance of blood sugar control in decelerating brain aging, highlighting the Mediterranean diet&#39;s benefits.- The DIRECT PLUS Brain MRI trial found that better blood sugar levels correlate with positive changes in brain regions impacted by aging, suggesting dietary changes could mitigate cognitive decline.- The research involved 300 participants over 18 months, using MRI to monitor brain health, and found that the Green Mediterranean diet, high in polyphenols, may support brain health and reduce age-related cognitive decline.</li>

<li>Stanford Medicine researchers have created a molecule that induces cancer cell self-destruction by linking two proteins, activating cell death genes.</li>
<li>This innovative method targets diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by connecting the BCL6 protein, which inhibits cell death, to CDK9, an enzyme that triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death).</li>
<li>The research, published in Science, is undergoing further testing in mice and may lead to clinical trials, with funding from institutions like the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the National Institutes of Health.</li>

<li>The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can truly unlearn unwanted behaviors, such as copyrighted or private content, without retraining.- It reveals that quantization, a process of reducing the precision of a model&#39;s weights, can restore a significant portion of &quot;forgotten&quot; information, with unlearned models retaining up to 83% of forgotten knowledge after 4-bit quantization.- The authors propose a quantization-robust unlearning strategy to effectively address the issue of incomplete unlearning in LLMs.</li>

<li>The blog post by Chris Farber examines if Redis is essential for web applications or if PostgreSQL can fulfill the same roles.- It highlights three Redis use cases: job queuing, application locks, and Pub/Sub, and explains how PostgreSQL can manage these tasks using SKIP LOCKED, advisory locks, and LISTEN/NOTIFY statements, respectively.- The discussion suggests that while Redis is superior in caching, PostgreSQL&#39;s capabilities might reduce the need for Redis, potentially lowering operational costs and complexity.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article reviews the evolution of the Finite Element Method (FEM) over 80 years, highlighting its significance in engineering and scientific modeling, particularly in solid mechanics.- FEM&#39;s development is categorized into four periods: early years (1941-1965), golden age (1966-1991), industrial applications and materials modeling (1992-2017), and the present and future.- It emphasizes FEM&#39;s integration with modern computational techniques like machine learning, its impact on industries, and its role in advancing engineering education and software development.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>In 2023, Shopify optimized Ruby&#39;s garbage collector by implementing out-of-band garbage collection to reduce latency, though initial heuristics were not fully effective.- By March 2024, a proof of concept was developed to disable major garbage collections during request cycles, leading to the introduction of a new method, GC.config(rgengc_allow_full_mark: true/false), in Ruby 3.4.0-preview2.- Implementing this method on 50% of Shopify&#39;s servers resulted in significant latency improvements, with modest capacity gains, and future efforts will focus on optimizing minor collections.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The guide introduces Ractor, a Rust library for actor-based programming, covering key concepts like messaging, installation, and creating actors.</li>
<li>It explains the &quot;cast&quot; (fire-and-forget) and &quot;call&quot; (wait for reply) messaging schemes, similar to Erlang, and provides code examples for creating and running actors.</li>
<li>The guide also details how to add state to actors and use <code>RpcReplyPort</code> for inter-actor communication, with examples of stateful actor implementation.</li>
</ul>
