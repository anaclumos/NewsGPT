            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated an antitrust trial against Google on September 9, 2024, in Virginia, focusing on Google&#39;s dominance in ad tech.</li>
<li>DOJ lawyer Julia Tarver Wood claimed Google has manipulated ad auctions, resulting in lower earnings for publishers and higher costs for advertisers.</li>
<li>The trial could be more damaging than previous cases, with the DOJ aiming to divest Google&#39;s Ad Manager suite, potentially leading to the separation of Google&#39;s search and advertising businesses.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Gartner&#39;s AI chief Erick Brethenoux claims that AI techniques requiring specialist hardware, such as GPUs, are &quot;doomed&quot; and represent a &quot;brute force&quot; phase that will end as programming techniques improve.</li>
<li>Brethenoux argues that generative AI is overhyped, suitable for only five percent of workloads, and suggests organizations can benefit from AI without relying heavily on it.</li>
<li>Gartner&#39;s Bern Elliot advises against over-relying on generative AI, recommending its use primarily for content generation and conversational interfaces, and suggests using non-generative AI to verify results.</li>

<li>Asynchronous IO (non-blocking IO) allows applications to handle many IO operations without blocking the calling OS thread or creating multiple threads, addressing the C10K problem of handling increasing internet traffic.</li>
<li>Despite its benefits, asynchronous IO introduces complexity, especially for operations like file IO on Linux, which always blocks, requiring alternative strategies like io_uring.</li>
<li>The author questions if the focus on asynchronous IO over the past 20 years was a mistake, suggesting that improving OS thread efficiency might have been a better approach, potentially eliminating the need for complex asynchronous IO techniques.</li>

<li>John Graham-Cumming&#39;s post about Steve Ballmer&#39;s binary search interview question has sparked interest on Hacker News.</li>
<li>Ballmer argues the game has a negative expected value, but John counters that with random number selection, the expected value is positive: $0.20.</li>
<li>Using mathematical optimization and scipy’s solver, a mixed strategy can be devised to ensure a positive expected value, making the game potentially profitable.</li>

<li>A recent court decision has reinstated non-compete agreements, reversing the FTC&#39;s ban and limiting job mobility and salary growth for employees.</li>
<li>District Court Judge Ada Brown ruled that the FTC overstepped its authority, emphasizing that only Congress or states can regulate non-compete clauses.</li>
<li>The decision reflects a conservative shift limiting federal agency powers, influenced by the Supreme Court&#39;s recent Loper Bright decision, which restricts agency power and leaves policy interpretation to judges.</li>

<li>In June 2023, Red Hat altered the distribution of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source code, sparking controversy and uncertainty for downstream rebuilds like Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, and Oracle Linux.</li>
<li>The open-source community criticized Red Hat&#39;s decision, with some considering a switch to Debian, despite Debian&#39;s less comprehensive security measures compared to Red Hat&#39;s SELinux.</li>
<li>SELinux, used by Red Hat, offers robust security with default policies and Multi-Category Security (MCS) labels, whereas Debian&#39;s AppArmor is simpler but less comprehensive and relies on user-implemented policies.</li>

<li>Through various optimizations, including disabling locale support and floating-point formatting, the binary size of <code>{fmt}</code> has been reduced to just 14kB, eliminating the need for the C++ runtime.</li>
<li>These optimizations make <code>{fmt}</code> highly suitable for memory-constrained devices and retro computing environments.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>paraLLEl-GS is a new Vulkan compute-based emulator for the PlayStation 2 Graphics Synthesizer (GS), inspired by the success of paraLLEl-RDP for the N64.</li>
<li>Unlike previous attempts, paraLLEl-GS focuses on high performance and avoiding obvious graphical issues, though it does not aim for bit-accuracy.</li>
<li>The project addresses the unique challenges of PS2 GS emulation, such as high fill-rate, quirky pixel pipeline features, and complex texturing and framebuffer operations.</li>
</ul>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A New York Times investigation revealed that Acadia Healthcare, a major chain of psychiatric hospitals, has been detaining patients against their will to maximize insurance payouts.</li>
<li>Authorities in at least 12 of the 19 states where Acadia operates have been alerted to these illegal detentions, with judges sometimes intervening to release patients.</li>
<li>Reports indicate that patients were often held without valid medical reasons, with employees pressured to exaggerate symptoms and extend stays, leading to severe ethical and legal concerns.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Lori Emerson&#39;s book, &quot;Other Networks: A Radical Technology Sourcebook,&quot; highlights the largely undocumented history of barbed wire fence telephone networks, which were crucial in rural U.S. and Canada during the early- to mid-20th century.</li>
<li>Barbed wire, initially patented for fencing livestock, was repurposed by farmers for informal telephone networks, especially after the end of Alexander Graham Bell&#39;s patent monopoly in 1893-94, allowing rural communities to communicate without central exchanges or monthly bills.</li>
<li>Despite weather-related issues, these networks thrived and were used into the 1970s, providing essential communication for emergencies, weather updates, and social interaction in cooperative farming areas.</li>
</ul>
