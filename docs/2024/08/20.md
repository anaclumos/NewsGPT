## [Toasts Are Bad UX](https://maxschmitt.me/posts/toasts-bad-ux)

- Toast notifications often appear far from the user's focus, causing usability issues, such as on YouTube where the toast appears in the bottom left while the user is focused on a modal in the center.
- Suggested solutions include displaying playlists beneath the button instead of in a modal and using loading indicators to imply action completion, eliminating the need for toasts.
- Examples from Gmail and clipboard actions show that toasts can be redundant, as other forms of feedback (like removing an email from the list or button confirmations) can effectively communicate success.
