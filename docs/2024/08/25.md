## [Defenders think in lists, attackers think in graphs (2015)](https://github.com/JohnLaTwC/Shared/blob/master/Defenders%20think%20in%20lists.%20Attackers%20think%20in%20graphs.%20As%20long%20as%20this%20is%20true%2C%20attackers%20win.md)

- Defenders often use lists to protect assets, but attackers exploit the interconnected nature of networks, which are better represented as graphs.
- Effective defense requires visualizing the network as a graph, reducing unnecessary connections, minimizing admin privileges, using two-factor authentication, and regularly rotating credentials.
- Adopting a graph-based mindset helps defenders better protect their networks, as attackers study the real network, not outdated diagrams or incomplete inventories.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41342637)

- Attackers focus deeply on a single mission, while defenders, such as SOC (Security Operations Center) teams, track multiple signals and prioritize threats based on regulations.
- Some experts suggest defenders should adopt graph-based thinking, similar to attackers, to better identify potential attack paths, with tools like BloodHound aiding in visualizing these paths in Active Directory (AD).
- Despite the potential benefits, defenders often face organizational constraints and compliance requirements, making it difficult to implement more dynamic, attacker-like strategies.
