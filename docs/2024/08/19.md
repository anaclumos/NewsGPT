## [Markov chains are funnier than LLMs](https://emnudge.dev/blog/markov-chains-are-funny/)

- Markov chains are simple statistical models predicting the next word based on context, unlike complex Large Language Models (LLMs) which use advanced vector math.
- LLMs, while accurate, often produce predictable and bland content, making them less effective for humor, which thrives on surprise and originality.
- The discussion suggests that a new type of language model might be needed to generate genuinely humorous content, highlighting a current limitation in LLMs.
