- PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modeling) doesn't cover all optimizations out-of-the-box, necessitating more sophisticated methods for larger design spaces.
- Tools like Nordic Semiconductor’s PPK II, Hall effect sensors, and shunt resistors are recommended for energy profiling and current measurement in battery projects.

## [Apple has reached its first-ever union contract with store employees in Maryland](https://apnews.com/article/apple-union-contract-maryland-store-f9884d978bf3129c37726dd7978392a5)

- The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers’ Coalition of Organized Retail Employees announced a three-year deal with Apple for employees at a Maryland store, increasing pay by an average of 10% and offering other benefits.
- The agreement, pending approval by about 85 employees, will be voted on Aug. 6, following a strike authorization in May due to unsatisfactory negotiations.
- This Maryland store is one of only two unionized Apple locations in the U.S., with the second in Oklahoma City still without a contract.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41089558)

- Apple has signed its first union contract with store employees in Maryland, marking a significant milestone in labor relations for the company.
- There is speculation that Apple may have agreed to the contract to avoid conflict, with some suggesting the company might close the store if unionization leads to problems, although closing a store solely due to unionization is illegal and hard to prove.
- The debate on the impact and necessity of unions persists, with arguments both for protecting workers' rights and against potential harm to businesses.

## [The irrational hungry judge effect revisited (2023)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/judgment-and-decision-making/article/irrational-hungry-judge-effect-revisited-simulations-reveal-that-the-magnitude-of-the-effect-is-overestimated/61CE825D4DC137675BB9CAD04571AE58)

- Online ordering is currently unavailable due to technical issues as of 10th July 2024; users are advised to check the website for updates.
- A study by Danziger, Levav, and Avnaim-Pesso (2011) found that Israeli judges' favorable parole decisions dropped significantly within a session but returned to initial levels after a break, suggesting mental depletion.
- Simulations indicate this effect might be overestimated and could be due to statistical artifacts, such as longer favorable rulings and rational time management by judges, necessitating further research.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41091803)

- The "irrational hungry judge effect" study, which claimed judges were more lenient after lunch, has been revisited and found to have significant flaws.
- The original research did not account for the non-random ordering of cases, with less severe cases being seen first and more severe ones later, affecting the outcomes.
- Critics suggest that randomizing case order could lead to more efficient and fair judicial decisions, raising broader questions about the impact of hunger on decision-making and the reliability of psychological studies.
