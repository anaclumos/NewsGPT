## [Asynchronous IO: the next billion-dollar mistake?](https://yorickpeterse.com/articles/asynchronous-io-the-next-billion-dollar-mistake/)

- Asynchronous IO (non-blocking IO) allows applications to handle many IO operations without blocking the calling OS thread or creating multiple threads, addressing the C10K problem of handling increasing internet traffic.
- Despite its benefits, asynchronous IO introduces complexity, especially for operations like file IO on Linux, which always blocks, requiring alternative strategies like io_uring.
- The author questions if the focus on asynchronous IO over the past 20 years was a mistake, suggesting that improving OS thread efficiency might have been a better approach, potentially eliminating the need for complex asynchronous IO techniques.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41471707)

- The discussion centers on the efficiency and practicality of asynchronous I/O (Input/Output) versus improving OS (Operating System) thread performance.
- Asynchronous I/O is argued to be more efficient because it minimizes the overhead associated with managing multiple threads, which each require their own stack and can lead to cache inefficiencies.
- The debate highlights that while asynchronous I/O is naturally suited for networking and other inherently asynchronous operations, improving OS thread performance could theoretically handle high concurrency but faces significant technical challenges.

## [Conservative GC can be faster than precise GC](https://wingolog.org/archives/2024/09/07/conservative-gc-can-be-faster-than-precise-gc)

- The debate between precise and conservative garbage collection (GC) centers on efficiency and performance, with conservative GC sometimes resulting in faster systems despite common beliefs favoring precise GC.
- Conservative GC can avoid run-time overhead, reduce stack frame sizes, and eliminate the need for stack maps, potentially leading to better compiler performance and smaller binaries.
- Anecdotal evidence, such as the Conservative Immix paper and practices by Appleâ€™s JavaScriptCore and V8, suggests that conservative stack scanning can outperform precise scanning in certain scenarios.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41473061)

- Conservative garbage collection (GC) can be faster than precise GC, but it may cause memory leaks by misinterpreting data as pointers.
- Go's switch from conservative to precise GC led to more allocations and potential performance hits, but optimizations have minimized latency and pauses.
- Amortized GC, which frees memory incrementally, might address issues of frequent allocations and deallocations that reduce throughput in precise GC.
