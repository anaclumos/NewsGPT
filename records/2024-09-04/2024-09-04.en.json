Bought it before \"Connect\" was a thing, so I don't have a subscription. But I cannot recommend it to anyone. There are better alternatives out there and MyDeepGuide (youtube) has reviewed them all better than I ever could. The software is moving too slowly and often in a wrong direction. Especially since they released the keyboard folio most updates were around typing (which is supar on any eink device)... and they generally made my experience as a pen user worse. I don't care if the new hardware is awesome, whenever mine breaks I will switch to a competitor. EDIT: the reviewer I mention is excited about the device https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkEg8WLeW4Q reply boomskats 3 hours agoparentI've owned a rm2 since xmas 2020 and really used to love it. I even brought an old obsidian plugin for it back from the dead. But the power button gave up 13 months in and they were dicks about it, and then when the pen nib holder disintegrated and they insisted it wasn't a known defect, I just gave up and it's been sat on my shelf ever since. For anyone still into them though, a Lamy EMR pen coupled with the Wacom felt pen nibs (pn ACK22213) is an incredible upgrade which makes it feel like a real fineliner. Similarly, I found the various titanium nibs that you can get off amazon made it feel like a real ballpoint [0]. [0]: https://reddit.com/r/RemarkableTablet/comments/1545mn9/excel... reply sp1rit 2 hours agorootparentThey absolutely know about this, given that the seemingly reworked markers for this tablet have a redesigned nib holder that doesn't look like it breaks as easily as the old ones. This is a common enough issue that there are people on ebay selling caps to replace the broken nib holder, but they seem to expensive for what amounts to a piece of 3D-printed plastic; I might just look into your solution with the lamy pen. It's just a shame that reMarkable is handling those issues so badly. They force you to buy a new pen for $130 because a little piece of broken plastic. reply juahan 1 hour agorootparentNot sure if country of residence makes any difference (I’m in EU), but at least I got a new pen from warranty when the nib holder broke. And I think it was even little over 2 years after the purchase. reply DavideNL 27 minutes agorootparentprev> \"But the power button gave up 13 months in\" I had the exact same issue on mine... you can just feel it's bad quality. reply dotancohen 4 hours agoparentprevI'm typing this on my Boox Note Air 2 Plus. I absolutely love this device. I usually use it without the backlight, but sometimes at night I'll use the backlight and the adjustable blue light filter is an absolute must. This is my fifth or sixth E-Ink device, and probably my favorite. It's an Android device, so everything that I was already using works on it. Notably Firefox when properly configured, and Ankidroid. reply paradox460 1 hour agorootparentI really do love mine too, and support has been rather good. I do worry about it reaching end of life, but only mildly. I do wish that boox would open source their android changes, they are arguably the best in class features for eink, and beat the pants off systems like the Kindle reply dotancohen 1 hour agorootparentI actually did love the E-Ink display algorithms, but maybe two months ago an update changed them and it is far worse. Lots of dithering, and I have a hard time configuring the \"Enhance dark colours\" and \"Enhance light colours\" settings to display apps as good as they were prior. Don't upgrade the OS! reply ajot 3 hours agorootparentprevAs I don't have an Android eink device (I do have an Android phone and a Kobo with KOReader, for the record), I would like to know: have you tried (and what are your opinions on) any apps designed specifically for eink screens? Thinking about EInkBro [0] as the browser or ReLaunchX [1] as the launcher, even KOReader as document reader. [0] https://github.com/plateaukao/einkbro [1] https://github.com/Leszek111/ReLaunchX reply dotancohen 1 hour agorootparentEInkBro is terrific. I filed a bug last year, the dev fixed it in less than a week. I use the stock launcher, but on an old Nook I used ReLaunchX, it was fine. On that device I only had two applications that I used anyway. I have not tried KOReader, but I can test it for you. What features do you use? reply bee_rider 4 hours agorootparentprevI just worry about using Android… this sort of e-ink device seems somehow even more personal than a laptop or cellphone (which are already quite personal); like a journal or something. I’d love one that had a community developed OS, like Linux or BSD. reply DavideNL 29 minutes agorootparent> \"I just worry about using Android…\" Exactly, I'm avoiding them for the same reason, I don't want to use a personal e-ink device running on an OS created by the biggest advertiser in the world. I was hoping Pocketbook would release something new this year running some Linux distro / with less tracking, and more privacy. PS. Also: i want a light sensor to automatically adjust brightness/night mode based on lighting conditions (previous Pocketbook models don't have this.) reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentprevBy now it is more than proven that devices with community developed OSes never take off to the amount to keep a sustainable business, and then there is the whole FOSS OS distribution politics on top. reply agentultra 4 hours agorootparentReMarkable2 is running on Gentoo iirc. reply pjmlp 2 hours agorootparentThey use their own in-house OS, based on Linux, Codex. reply eightysixfour 2 hours agorootparentprevEvery time I look at it I get turned off by Android 11 being so old. I don’t know the Google ecosystem as well, how much longer will that API version be supported? Does it get security updates? Can I unlock it and install something less Googled? reply dotancohen 1 hour agorootparentI don't believe that there are third-party Android builds for the Boox devices, simply because they've modified it to better fit E-Ink screens. reply gcr 4 hours agorootparentprevI have the slightly older Boox Note Air 2, and can second this comment. It’s a really nice device! reply xrd 5 hours agoparentprevI excitedly went to that channel. I'm overwhelmed! Can you tell me the top three devices he recommends so I can review those videos? Man, he makes a lot of stuff! reply funksta 4 hours agorootparentI believe he has said the Supernote A5X is his favourite. There's a newer A5X2 coming out later this year to update it (though it has repeatedly been delayed) reply ahci8e 43 minutes agorootparentI have a Supernote A5X! It's great! I got it to replace my old rm and never looked back. I also recently bought the Supernote A6X2. Not sure which I prefer size-wise. Sometimes the smaller A6X2 is great, especially for reading. Other times drawing on the A5X is more comfortable. One thing I don't like about the A6X2 is that there is a noticeable gap between the screen and the pen. This gap isn't there (or maybe is just way smaller) on the A5X. The screen on the A6X2 is also textured, I guess to try to mimic paper, but I grew to like the gel pen feel of the A5X screen. reply widowlark 4 hours agorootparentprevThe A6X2 is great as well, and fits a surprisingly small niche for smaller writing devices. I would also love a device that is the size of a pocket notepad someday reply vadansky 4 hours agorootparentprevLooking at the video there is a significant lag in the rendering. Is it noticeable when you're writing? Also looks like there is no pressure sensitivity so all the notes are come out in that ugly fat style. Maybe I'm just spoiled with my Wacom though! reply gpm 2 hours agorootparent> Looking at the video there is a significant lag in the rendering. Is it noticeable when you're writing? Speaking from my experience with a remarkable, not on that device. I think two factors contribute to this. One is that there are different rendering modes, and it uses a very fast one for updating pen strokes so there is less delay than you would guess by looking at larger updates. The other is that the stylus obscures the very end of the line anyways. reply NoahKAndrews 4 hours agorootparentprevI like my A5X reply laserbeam 4 hours agorootparentprevHe does have best-of videos. There's at least one at the end of each year, but there was also one a few days/weeks ago. reply wavemode 4 hours agoparentprevLast time I shopped for an e-ink device (as a gift for my brother), I considered the remarkable, and even purchased one. Ended up returning it. It's just too limited in too many unnecessary ways. I got a supernote instead. He couldn't be happier with it. reply _ph_ 4 hours agoparentprevWhich device would work better than the remarkable for its intended purpose of note taking? reply freilanzer 2 hours agorootparentFrom my searches, Supernote A5x or Samsung Tab 9 series. reply adastra22 2 hours agoparentprevEvery single update has made my reMarkable tablet worse. I’ve stopped using it as a result. I have absolutely no idea why they went all in on keyboard input, when the whole freaking point of the tablet was that you could write on it like paper. reply mancerayder 4 hours agoparentprevI've just ordered the Supernote Nomad. Small but my first experience with these things. Hopefully I haven't made a mistake! reply JeremyNT 4 hours agoparentprevI believe what you say is true for the average HN reader. I also believe the subscription is kind of ridiculous. However, I also believe there is a market out there for a device like this that is 1) extremely limited and 2) very focused on a few specific tasks (handwriting and document review workflow) Sometimes the other stuff is a distraction. My wife owns the remarkable 2 and it is really good for what she wants (\"just\" a replacement for paper). reply RyeCombinator 5 hours agoparentprevSupernote is a good choice! reply cubefox 2 hours agoprevSo according to the \"deep guide\" video review, this uses E Ink's \"Gallery 3\" e-paper screen. Which, unlike conventional displays, doesn't use additive subpixel color mixing. Instead it uses subtractive color mixing inside each pixel: It layers transparent cyan, magenta and yellow, and opaque white pigments, over each other. Which creates cyan, magenta, yellow and white as primary colors, and red, green, blue and black as secondary colors. Other shades are then created via dithering those eight base colors. So it works very similar to an inkjet printer. Since it doesn't use subpixels, the screen seems to have a similar brightness to greyscale E Ink displays, which is reasonably close to printed paper. However, the color saturation is clearly still not quite on the level of actual printed paper. Here is a comparison shot between Gallery 3 and Kaleido 3 (the latter uses conventional subpixels to create colors): https://assets.goodereader.com/blog/uploads/images/2023/03/2... And of course the reaction times are not as fast as LCD/OLED. As is well known, E Ink uses electrophoresis e-paper screens, where solid electrically charged pigments are moved around in a liquid, which is a slow process. It also still requires a \"deghosting\" refresh once the screen changes, but interestingly those refreshs are now only applied to the parts of the screen which actually have changed pixel values, which looks significantly less distracting in my opinion. reply freedomben 2 hours agoprevThere aren't many companies for whom I have love like Remarkable. All I've ever wanted is hardware that isn't needlessly closed or locked down, that is hacker friendly. Remarkable mostly delivered that. But it feels like they've been increasingly moving away from that, especially where the openness now competes with their cloud subscription. Given the amount of love the open source community has shown Remarkable, I think they could let the community build some amazing software for them. This would be doubly beneficial because the software is the weak point currently for the Remarkable. If they were to open source the existing software, even with a CLA copyright assignment, I bet there'd be a huge influx of people contributing. I hope with this new Paper Pro that they are moving in the direction of openness/hackability and not more closed like they did with the Remarkable 2. Would love to hear from people who have tried the Paper Pro about how that is. Side note: If you haven't gotten the RCU utility application, you definitely should! It's a great tool[1] [1]: https://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/ reply lidavidm 6 hours agoprevI had a reMarkable 2 and gave up it almost solely because it didn't support USB mass storage (like Kobo devices do), making it really annoying to transfer files. Also, their software update made the reader worse, since I went from being able to manually crop the page to fit the viewport to having to carefully pinch-zoom with a bunch of latency and really weird sensitivity. And they seem oddly insistent they're not a reading device anyways; if they supported ePub 3 (particularly ePub 3 fixed layout - again, Kobo supports this) that would have made it a nice comics machine, but no. (And their weird web interface choked if you tried to transfer \"large\" books.) 100K JPY too, which is in the range of an iPad Air. I hope some of these software issues get ironed out and maybe I'll consider it again... reply Terretta 5 hours agoparent> Remarkable 2 and gave up it almost solely because it didn't support USB mass storage, making it really annoying to transfer files We had hoped to buy these for all our paperless office employees, and gave it up almost solely because it was far too easy to transfer files. If they deliver a device with on-device encryption (as this claims) and sync or manual transfer tied (and locked) to company-owned storage, we'd buy them for all our Pro(fessionals). To your point, instead we give our professionals iPad Air with Paperlike™ for pencil-feel and a keyboard for on-the-go use. We'd rather (for reasons) give them Remarkable Pros if it was capable of meeting Professional data-loss-prevention (DLP) needs. reply donatj 5 hours agorootparentLet me ask you this in all seriousness and with minimal snark - do you confiscate employees paper notebooks when they leave the company? reply rkangel 4 hours agorootparentWe expect people to have a labbook per project. They are logged when handed out, and signed back in at the end of the project. For a science/engineering firm, this sort of arrangement isn't uncommon, because stuff you do in the lab leads to customer deliverables. Of course, people can also do things electronically, which they increasingly do. reply BadHumans 4 hours agorootparentprevI worked at company that required all paper notebooks to be handed in and destroyed. There are entire companies based on destroying sensitive paper documents. reply croes 1 hour agorootparentThey know that smartphone have cameras? reply smithcoin 1 hour agorootparentemployees often aren't allowed to have them onsite in these circumstances for this precise reason. reply lovecg 4 hours agorootparentprevIf you can transfer gigabytes of data with a paper notebook then I’m really impressed! But seriously this is similar to banning usb flash drives and the like, it’s not that unusual. reply lynndotpy 4 hours agorootparentprevThis isn't unreasonable or unheard of in some contexts, especially anywhere requiring a security clearance. reply jabroni_salad 4 hours agorootparentprevI used to work at a federal contractor. Any paper you bring to the building /never/ leaves again. I liked to keep notes in a legal pad and would just shred them. reply gadders 1 hour agorootparentprevNot the OP, but eInk tablets are banned at our work for the same reason, and paper notebooks don't get destroyed. I one of the reasons is it's easier for a malignant actor to get access to notes without you knowing when it's electronic. At least with a paper notebook you can tell if it's missing. reply samatman 3 hours agorootparentprevThere are jobs where producing a paper notebook is the primary deliverable. Fewer than there were, due to y'know, computers. But it still happens. It's odd to describe that as confiscation. A lab notebook belongs to the lab, not the researcher, this is understood by both parties. They may or may not have permission to leave the lab with it, but making personal copies of the pages would be espionage. It's perfectly reasonable to want comparable properties in a paper-replacing device. I can see where you might find that jarring if you haven't been exposed to work conditions where it's normal and expected. reply elric 5 hours agoparentprevSimilar experiences with the reMarkable 1. The USB interface really bugs me. It's nice for annotating and highlighting PDFs, but pretty bad for reading. Great for taking notes, but awful at extracting them, unless you get an expensive subscription to their \"cloud\" garbage, which feels extortionate considering how expensive the device is. reply _ph_ 5 hours agoparentprevYou can ssh into the remarkable and copy files via scp. reply tecleandor 4 hours agorootparentBut, afaik, they keep an index and some extra files in their own format to track them [0], so you can't \"just\" upload the files. You need a tool to do that additional work. I use RCU [1] for that. 0: https://remarkable.jms1.info/info/filesystem.html 1: https://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/ reply lidavidm 5 hours agorootparentprevYeah. Still way more effort than Kobo: plug it in, drag and drop. reply chickenimprint 4 hours agorootparentI've switched to exclusively using SSH on my Kobo, because I find it less effortful. The connection procedure consists of enabling wifi on the Kobo and clicking on the sftp bookmark in my file browser. reply whycome 4 hours agorootparentWait is this an official method? reply SSLy 3 hours agorootparentNo, it's KFmon stuff. reply MayeulC 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat's wrong with the USB web interface of the remarkable, though? It is quite spartan, but I haven't updated mine in ages, so I imagine they have improved it. The workflow is plug -> web browser -> remarkable IP -> drag and drop. reply lidavidm 4 hours agorootparentThat's still quite a bit more than just plug -> drag and drop, also especially because sometimes I had to manually bring up the interface, and remember some IP that I might only use every week or two at most. (I guess I could set up a bookmark, sure.) Also, it chokes on large-ish files (it would just never upload, no indication in the UI), so I had to split up books. Anyways, I think I could have dealt with it if it handled large books fine. reply heyflyguy 6 hours agoprevI love my Remarkable, it forces me to stay in creativity mode without jumping to the internet since it doesn't have a browser. That being said, the inability to simply put your own templates in the machine and have them persist through and update is so close to being a showstopper for me that I am not sure I would consider buying a new one. The RM2 template manager is great, but you have to update your templates after every firmware update and I hate that with a passion! reply pcl 6 hours agoparentI have scripted this (well, installation of some systemd units, but the workflow is the same). So I just plug my tablet into my laptop and run my script every time it updates. It’s not ideal, but not super tedious either. I’ve been planning to start charging via a raspberry pi so that the pi can automatically tend to the device whenever it’s connected, but haven’t gotten there yet. reply tjoff 5 hours agorootparentWhy not script it over ssh (wifi), preference or is not as simple as I imagine? (never used one but the ability to get shell and be able to rsync files is one of the reasons I consider a remarkable). I could be misinformed though, haven't researched it a lot. reply pcl 3 hours agorootparentFirmware updates blow away any customizations. So you need to bootstrap things again after each update. Updates can be deferred, so the process isn’t too disruptive. Edit: oh, yeah I see what you’re getting at. That direction could work, and I used to do that years ago, as it turns out, but these days I am frequently not on a familiar WiFi network when I’m using the tablet, so cabling has been more practical. reply tjoff 2 hours agorootparentAh, if I'm on the go I think I'd hotspot on my phone and sync via termux, but that is great to hear! reply pcl 1 hour agorootparentIME IP addresses handed out by my phone’s tethering mode aren’t stable, so it’s sorta more of a hassle than just fishing out the little cable and letting my script run. (The device assigns itself a stable IP address on the USB interface.) Although I haven’t looked at those addresses in some time; perhaps they are more stable now than they used to be. reply funksta 4 hours agoparentprevMany rM owners (myself included) work around the template limitations by using pdfs as \"templates\" and writing on them. This covers probably 95% of my use of the device, their notebooks feel very limited by comparison reply throwuxiytayq 4 hours agorootparentIf you do it this way, can you move pages around within the notebook, across different notebooks, add additional pages, delete pages, change the template for a specific page, etc? Seems like a rather crude workaround reply _benj 3 hours agoprevI had an iPad Air, which I changed for a reMarkable 2 and I couldn't be happier! I see a lot of people here commenting about the limitations of it, and I get it. For me personally those limitations are features. My needs are mostly note taking and reading technical PDFs, and for that the reMarkable is fantastic. I used it extensively while taking Calculus, which, it was great to use as many pages as I needed and to write as big as I wanted without worrying about \"wasting\" paper. I miss background light from time to time, which I think is a great addition. I'm not super familiar with alternatives so I can't say that is better than X or Y, but I personally have been moving as much as I can to single purpose electronic devices. That allows me to be more focus and not fight my device wanting to distract me. That takes out every eInk table that has android for me, I don't want a yet another multipurpose device that I need to develop discipline to use it! On that line, I love my kindle, but that spends about 90% of the time in airplane mode, because, again, the kindle is for readin, the reMarkable for taking notes and reading Datasheets and such... But, that's just me :-) reply freilanzer 2 hours agoparent> My needs are mostly note taking and reading technical PDFs, and for that the reMarkable is fantastic. I do both of those and I dislike the RM2. There's little space for notes above and below the PDF page, no infinite canvas. I have more space on the back of a printed PDF (to the left of the current text page) than in the RM2. So, all note taking in a PDF for me is just keywords, while I would much prefer to put text and drawing,s graphs, etc. all around the PDF page. So, for the last few months I have barely used the RM2 and have gone back to pen and paper. reply _benj 2 hours agorootparentMakes sense… my note taking is more like highlighting and such, since I later get those out into my project documentation reply beoberha 4 hours agoprevMy RM2 is sitting in a drawer. I really wanted to like it and build it into my daily workflow, but the software never made me feel I was being productive. Scrolling through notes is incredibly slow, so any attempt to reference a past note was just met with frustration and yearning for a paper notebook. reply nfriedly 4 hours agoparentPass it on to someone else then. It looks like you can get ~$300 for it on ebay: https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=remarkable+2&rt=nc&LH_S... reply beoberha 24 minutes agorootparentWoah I’m shocked! I’ll definitely be doing that. reply withinrafael 3 hours agoparentprevSame here, and PDFs are very slow to load and sometimes fail. It's also just a tad too heavy for one handed use. reply regularfry 5 hours agoprevThe things I don't like about my rm2 are: - how fast the nibs wear out - how inaccurate the screen is - the screen update rate - infinite pages It sounds like they might have fixed the nibs. The rest of it is up in the air. I think infinite pages might be workable if the update rate is better, but it's also got bad ergonomics. It's far too easy to accidentally trigger a scroll. It was bad enough when all you could do was accidentally zoom, but the infinite pages update really messed with it. reply jasone 46 minutes agoparentThe addition of infinite pages made my RM2 unusable. It's far too easy to accidentally scroll, and hugely disruptive. I checked for tuning improvements for a couple of software updates, then set it aside permanently. That such a \"simple\" change could doom the device made me decide to go back to real paper, in all likelihood forever. reply packetlost 5 hours agoparentprevThis is pretty much all of my concerns as well. The top like 2/3rds of mine is pretty accurate on the tip of the pencil when writing, but on the bottom 1/3rd it's off by about 2mm and it's freaking obnoxious. It makes me hate writing on it to the point where I've gone back to real paper. I do occasionally use it for reading papers and other page-sized PDFs, but it's really not worth the cost for writing. reply tr3ntg 49 minutes agorootparentSame. I can draw a straight line down my screen, and the drawn path deviates noticeably in certain areas, despite the pen moving in a straight path. Makes writing difficult. Have to sort of trust your hand movement, rather than watching your markings on the screen. Adjusting to the drawn marks will just lead you off slanted. reply AlanYx 4 hours agorootparentprevPen accuracy uniformity has always been one of the bigger issues with the RM2 in comparison to its e-ink competitors. It's beyond annoying to pick up the pen to dot an \"i\" and see the dot appear a mm away from the rest of the letter, especially if you're writing along the right edge of the device. This is probably one of the motivations why they're ditching EMR pens in this new device. reply packetlost 4 hours agorootparentIf the new pens fix the issue, that alone is worth an upgrade, but I think it's too late for me. 1 RM Pro vs a nice notebook, pencil, eraser, lead, and iPad Air for about the same cost is just... not happening. I'm not falling for it again. reply Solstinox 4 hours agorootparentprevUse the pen that comes with it, magnet side facing the screen and sweep across the areas that are misaligned or the whole screen. This fixes things for me. reply tr3ntg 48 minutes agorootparentI’ve heard this and tried and didn’t notice a difference. What’s supposed to happen here? I have the Marker Plus. reply packetlost 1 hour agorootparentprevI haven't heard this trick. I'll try it out! reply AlanYx 3 hours agorootparentprevMine actually usually has okay uniformity everywhere except about an inch from the right edge (particularly 1/3rd of the way from the top) and the magnet trick doesn't fix it for me there. reply freilanzer 2 hours agorootparentprevThis has never worked for me. Sometimes it's more than 1 mm off. reply regularfry 3 hours agorootparentprevNot for me. reply regularfry 4 hours agorootparentprevI use mine mostly for drawing diagrams and sketches, and the fact that I can barely predict the start point, end point, or route that a line I'm drawing will take means that it's rough sketches at best. Enough to capture an idea but I'm reminded how far from heaven we are when I go back to a propelling pencil on sketch paper. reply jks 6 hours agoprevWould be interesting to hear from someone who has compared this and https://daylightcomputer.com/ reply mattkevan 5 hours agoparentI’ve got a RM2 and a Daylight tablet. In ambient light the contrast is worse on the Daylight than the RM2 - the screen background is quite significantly darker. However, the Daylight has a backlight which increases the contrast enormously. And it’s usable in the dark which the RM2 is not. The much faster refresh rate also gives it a more fluid feel. What I didn’t anticipate is the difference the screen makes in how I use and perceive them: As the RM2 is so simple and static it feels more like a notebook or book reader that happens to be battery powered, whereas the Daylight is definitely a gadget. I’m more likely to use the RM2 to take notes or do some thinking and the Daylight as something to tinker with. reply DennisAleynikov 3 hours agorootparentGood point! The remarkable is a lot more like paper and has that simple feel. Daylight was created for the express purpose of being a portable computer you can use in direct sunlight. It can also just be your notebook but it does so much more than take notes. I may be a little bit biased but I'd personally prefer a non-laggy device with a little bit worse contrast. To each their own! reply funksta 4 hours agoparentprevI haven't used a Daylight (yet) but here's a side-by-side video of them being used in sunlight: https://x.com/daylightco/status/1808213555579441214 The reMarkable has better contrast, viewing angle, and resolution, the Daylight has a far better refresh rate. There are other tradeoffs between them of course, but display-wise, those are the main ones reply layer8 6 hours agoparentprevDC has even worse contrast than e-ink. reply mrzool 6 hours agorootparentSince when does e-ink have bad contrast? reply AlanYx 5 hours agorootparentDepends what your reference is. E-ink displays without a lot of layers (especially Carta 1250) have pretty good contrast, on par with matte paper. Some devices with a thick frontlight layer and a Wacom layer and a touch layer are less impressive. reply layer8 5 hours agorootparentprevHave you ever compared with actual printed paper? reply mrzool 5 hours agorootparentNever, and I’m not even sure about the ratio — I just never noticed poor contrast on my old Kindle, which I’ve been using for the last 10 years or so. reply layer8 4 hours agorootparentPrinted paper (black on white) has a contrast ratio of 1:50 to up to (for glossy paper) 1:200, significantly higher than e-ink. reply Rinzler89 6 hours agorootparentprevnext [11 more] [flagged] smith7018 5 hours agorootparentIt's not really a scam but rather a technology that's still in its infancy.

Community developed FOSS SW can sometimes be better quality and more functional than commercial SW. For example I see KDE as being far superior than whatever Microsoft is doing now on the Windows desktop side, where one is free developed by the community and the other costs money and is tailor made by a trillion dollar corp. Case in point, I had a Tolino(Kobo) ebook reader and the KOREADER PDF reader I sideloaded on it from github was way better than the tailor made one it shipped with.

First of all, you are comparing two desktop environments that have been around for almost the same amount of time. KDE is extremely mature, both because of its age and its popularity. This is not the case with some niche e-ink products. Secondly, you cannot even remotely compare the software needed for document rendering with the one for hand writing. The former is a very mature ecosystem and you can just write a UI on top of muPDF and port it to your platform to have a feature complete solution. The latter instead requires a wealth of expertise in how humans write and draw to develop both the drivers and the user land applications.

It was a ballpoint-pen with a little computer inside and a camera pointing down the tip of the pen. You'd use it with special notebooks that had very small dot-patterns printed on the paper, and the computer could decode that to get its position on the page. Then you'd plug it into your PC's USB port to upload a digital copy of your notes. There was surprisingly-good OCR to make it searchable and also the pen had a microphone that recorded what your professor was saying during any given penstroke. And that's in addition to having the physical notebook the ballpoint pen wrote on. Looks like they still exist but they haven't done much in the last 15 years. They used to make these high-quality leather-bound notebooks but now it seems they only have cheap spiral-bound ones. Worse, the pen still costs about $200 so it's not in anyway competitive with remarkable. I'm contemplating going to grad school and I might try to dig up my old livescribe pen if I can find it (I think I saw it a year or two ago in some box of assorted odds and ends) but the lack of high-quality journals is a disappointment and if I can't find my old livescribe pen I'd rather try out remarkable than spend 10x as much on a nearly-dead product that had far more potential but seems to be on life-support.

So, I settled on getting a Samsung Tablet with a S-Pen and using the \"Flexcil Notes & PDF Reader\" app. The tablet was not cheaper than ReMarkable but I had access to all the apps in the Android ecosystem.

(there's a specific duty category for tablets and e-readers) Sales tax is 13% in Ontario, so even with that, the exchange rate should be 1.35 * 1.13 = 1.53 not the 1.60 exchange rate they use. I'm assuming shipping is already included in the price in the US as well, and shipping cost in Canada shouldn't be that much different compared to the US. I guess if the cost of shipping is higher in Canada, then that explains the USD-CAD conversion jump from 1.53 to 1.60. reply DiggyJohnson 4 hours agoprevLove the hardware hate the software.

I got my first remarkable a few years ago and I was super excited, I thought it could be the bridge between my need to write and the digital world. I gave up, I also tried an iPad too but again I gave up. I ended up using a cheap fountain pen and the paper that I like its texture. I think the problem with all these devices is that from a product perspective they focus on the wrong things. I don’t care about colors and syncing with the cloud or whatever else. I care about emulating an as close as possible experience to natural writing and that means latency of the device and the tactile feeling I get when I touch the screen with the pen are the most important aspects. I haven’t seen much there happening and maybe these are just too hard problems to solve. Or maybe I’m just a member of a too niche group of people.

What’s the business plan? (I’m not rich enough to be in these meetings) I just don’t see how the returns will happen. Open source LLMs exist and will get better. Is it just that all these companies will vie for a winner-take-all situation where the “best” model will garner the subscription?

If AGI is actually reached, capital as we know it basically becomes worthless. The entire structure of the modern economy and the society surrounding it collapses overnight. I also don't think there's any way the governments of the world let real AGI stay in the hands of private industry. If it happens, governments around the world will go to war to gain control of it. SSI would be nationalized the moment AGI happened and there's nothing A16Z could do about it. reply throwawayk7h 44 minutes agoparentprevIf Ilya is sincere in his belief about safe superintelligence being within reach in a decade or so, and the investors sincerely believe this as well, then the business plan is presumably to deploy the superintelligence in every field imaginable. \"SSI\" in pharmaceuticals alone would be worth the investment. It could cure every disease humanity has ever known, which should give it at least a $2 trillion valuation. I'm not an economist, but since the valuation is $5bn, it stands to reason that evaluators believe there is at most a 1 in 400 chance of success? reply throwup238 33 minutes agorootparent> It could cure every disease humanity has ever known, which should give it at least a $2 trillion valuation. The lowest hanging fruit aren't even that pie in the sky. The LLM doesn't need to be capable of original thought and research to be worth hundreds of billions, they just need to be smart enough to apply logic to analyze existing human text. It's not only a lot more achievable than a super AI that can control a bunch of lab equipment and run experiments, but also fits the current paradigm of training the LLMs on large text datasets. The US Code and Code of Federal Regulations are on the order of 100 million tokens each. Court precedent contains at least 1000x as many tokens [1], when the former are already far beyond the ability of any one human to comprehend in a lifetime. Now multiply that by every jurisdiction in the world. An industry of semi-intelligent agents that can be trusted to do legal research and can be scaled with compute power would be worth hundreds of billions globally just based on legal and regulatory applications alone. Allowing any random employee to ask the bot \"Can I legally do X?\" is worth a lot of money.

And furthermore, if AGI is solved, the TMV of pretty much everything else drops to zero. The play here is to basically invest in all possible players who might reach AGI, because if one of them does, you just hit the infinite money hack. And maybe with SSI you've saved the world too. reply gigatexal 13 minutes agorootparentSo then the investment thesis hinges on what the investor thinks AGI’s chances are. 1/100 1/1M 1/1T? What if it never pans out is there infrastructure or other ancillary tech that society could benefit from? For example all the science behind the LHC, or bigger and better telescopes: we might never find the theory of everything but the tech that goes into space travel, the science of storing and processing all that data, better optics etc etc are all useful tech reply jedberg 7 minutes agorootparentIt's more game theory. Regardless of the chances of AGI, if you're not invested in it, you will lose everything if it happens. It's more like a hedge on a highly unlikely event. Like insurance. And we already seeing a ton of value in LLMs. There are lots of companies that are making great use of LLMs and providing a ton of value. One just launched today in fact: https://www.paradigmai.com/ (I'm an investor in that). There are many others (some of which I've also invested in).

Every. Single. One. It’s the same story with Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook/Meta, Microsoft, etc. etc. That’s the point of venture capital; making extremely risky bets spread across a wide portfolio in the hopes of hitting the power law lottery with 1-3 winners. Most funds will not beat the S&P 500, but again, that’s the point. Risk and reward are intrinsically linked. In fact, due to the diversification effects of uncorrelated assets in a portfolio (see MPT), even if a fund only delivers 5% returns YoY after fees, that can be a great outcome for investors. A 5% return uncorrelated to bonds and public stocks is an extremely valuable financial product. It’s clear that humans find LLMs valuable. What companies will end up capturing a lot of that value by delivering the most useful products is still unknown. Betting on one of the biggest names in the space is not a stupid idea (given the purpose of VC investment) until it actually proves itself to be in the real world. reply svnt 2 minutes agorootparent> Risk and reward are intrinsically linked There are innumerable ways to increase your risk without increasing your potential reward. reply gigatexal 7 minutes agorootparentprev> While I get the cynicism (and yes, there is certainly some dumb money involved), it’s important to remember that every tech company that’s delivered 1000X returns was also seen as ridiculously overhyped/overvalued in its early days.

It didn’t take a huge leap to think that bookstores on the web could scale. Nobody knew if it would be Amazon to pull it off, sure, but I mean ostensibly why not? (Yes, yes hindsight being what it is…) Apple — yeah the personal computer nobody fathomed but the immediate business use case for empowering accountants maybe should have been an easy logical next step. Probably why Microsoft scooped the makers of Excel so quickly. Google? Organizing the world’s data and making it searchable a la the phone book and then (maybe they didn’t think of that maybe Wall Street forced them to) monetizing their platform and all the eyeballs is just an ad play scaled insanely thanks to the internet. I dunno.

Nobody even knew what OpenAI was up to when they were gathering training data - they got away with a lot. Now there is precedent and people are paying more attention. Data that was previously free/open now has a clause that it can't be used for AI training. OpenAI didn't have to deal with any of that. Also OpenAI used cheap labor in Africa to tag training data which was also controversial. If someone did it now it would they'd be the ones to pay. OpenAI can always say \"we stopped\" like Nike said with sweat shops. A lot has changed. reply vidarh 1 hour agorootparentThere are at least 3 companies with staff in developed countries well above minimum wage doing tagging and creation of training data, and at least one of them that I have an NDA with pays at least some of their staff tech contractor rates for data in some niches and even then some of data gets processed by 5+ people before it's returned to the client. Since I have ended up talking to 3, and I'm hardly well connected in that space, I can only presume there are many more. Companies are willing to pay a lot for clean training data, and my bet is there will be a growing pile of training sets for sale on a non-exclusive basis as well.

Very interesting, thanks for sharing that detail. As someone who has tinkered with tokenizing/training I quickly found out this must be the case. Some people on HN don't know this.

Minus the urgency, scientific process, well-defined goals, target dates, public ownership, accountability... reply digging 3 hours agorootparentInteresting attributes to mention... The urgency was faked and less true of the Manhattan Project than it is of AGI safety. There was no nuclear weapons race; once it became clear that Germany had no chance of building atomic bombs, several scientists left the MP in protest, saying it was unnecessary and dangerous. However, the race to develop AGI is very real, and we also have no way of knowing how close anyone is to reaching it. Likewise, the target dates were pretty meaningless. There was no race, and the atomic bombs weren't necessary to end the war with Japan either. (It can't be said with certainty one way or the other, but there's pretty strong evidence that their existence was not the decisive factor in surrender.) Public ownership and accountability are also pretty odd things to say! Congress didn't even know about the Manhattan Project. Even Truman didn't know for a long time. Sure, it was run by employees of the government and funded by the government, but it was a secret project with far less public input than any US-based private AI companies today. reply jedberg 12 minutes agorootparent> The urgency was faked and less true of the Manhattan Project than it is of AGI safety.

More specifically: it is highly implausible that an AI system could learn to improve itself beyond human capability if it does not have long-term plasticity: how would it be able to reflect upon and extend its discoveries if it's not able to learn new things during its operation? reply scarmig 1 hour agorootparentAnterograde amnesia is a significant disruption of plasticity, and yet people who have it are still intelligent.

Either you are correct and the neural networks humans have are exactly the same or very similar to the programs in the LLMs. Then it will be relatively easy to verify this - just scale one LLN to the human brain neuron count and supposedly it will acquire consciousness and start rapidly learning and creating on its own without prompts. 2. Or what we call neural networks in the computer programs is radically different and or insufficient to create AI. I'm leaning to the second option, just from the very high level and rudimentary reading about current projects. Can be wrong of course. But I have yet to see any paper that refutes option 2, so it means that it is still possible. reply barrell 3 hours agorootparentI agree with your stance - that being said there aren’t two options, one being identical or radically different. It’s not even a gradient between two choices, because there are several dimensions involved and nobody even knows what Superintelligence is anyways. If you wanted to reduce it down, I would say there are two possibilities: 1. Our understanding of Neurel Nets is currently sufficient to recreate intelligence, consciousness, or what have you 2.

The back propagation math for a transformer is no different than for a multi-layer perception, yet a transformer is vastly more capable than a MLP.

The argument goes something like: 1. Humans have general intelligence. 2. Human brains use biological neurons. 3. Human biological neurons give rise to human general intelligence. 4. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are similar to human brains. 5. Therefore an ANN could give rise to artificial general intelligence. Many people are objecting to #4 here. However in writing this out, I think #3 is suspect as well: many animals who do not have general intelligence have biologically identical neurons, and although they have clear structural differences with humans, we don’t know how that leads to general intelligence. We could also criticize #1 as well, since human brains are pretty bad at certain things like memorization or calculation. Therefore if we built an ANN with only human capabilities it should also have those weaknesses. reply zeroonetwothree 2 hours agorootparentprevFor any technology we haven’t achieved yet there’s some probability we never achieve it (say, at least in the next 100 years).

There are only two fundamental possibilities why this could not be replicated in silicon: 1. There is a chemical-level nature to intelligence which prevents other elements like silicon from being used as a substrate for intelligence 2. There is a non material aspect to intelligence that cannot be replicated except by humans To my knowledge, there is no scientific evidence that either are true and there is already a large body of evidence that implies that intelligence happens at a higher level of abstraction than the individual chemical reactions of synapses, ie. the neural network, which does not rely on the existence of any specific chemicals in the system except in as much as they perform certain functions that seemingly could be performed by other materials. If anything, this is more like speculating that there is a way to create energy from sunlight using plants as an existence proof of the possibility of doing so. More specifically, this is a bet that an existing physical phenomenon can be replicated using a different substrate. reply mitthrowaway2 2 hours agorootparentprevI'd put decent odds on a $1B research project developing time travel if time travel were an ability that every human child was innately born with.

Basically, unless you can show humans calculating a non-Turing computable function, the notion that intelligence requires a biological system is an absolutely extraordinary claim. If you were to argue about conscience or subjective experience or something equally woolly, you might have a stronger point, and this does not at all suggest that current-architecture LLMs will necessarily achieve it. reply mitthrowaway2 1 hour agorootparentprevThere's a big difference between \"this project is like time travel or cold fusion; it's doubtful whether the laws of physics even permit it\" and \"this project is like heavier-than-air flight; we know birds do it somehow, but there's no way our crude metal machines will ever match them\".

But both of these \"sides\" feel like they miss the mark to me. On one hand, I think it's great that investors are willing to throw big chunks of money at hard (or at least expensive) problems. I'm pretty sure all the investors putting money in will do just fine even if their investment goes to zero, so this feels exactly what VC funding should be doing, rather than some other common \"how can we get people more digitally addicted to sell ads?\" play. On the other hand, I'm kind of baffled that we're still talking about \"AGI\" in the context of LLMs. While I find LLMs to be amazing, and an incredibly useful tool (if used with a good understanding of their flaws), the more I use them, the more that it becomes clear to me that they're not going to get us anywhere close to \"general intelligence\". That is, the more I have to work around hallucinations, the more that it becomes clear that LLMs really are just \"fancy autocomplete\", even if it's really really fancy autocomplete. I see lots of errors that make sense if you understand an LLM is just a statistical model of word/token frequency, but you would expect to never see these kinds of errors in a system that had a true understanding of underlying concepts. And while I'm not in the field so I may have no right to comment, there are leaders in the field, like LeCun, who have expressed basically the same idea. So my question is, has Sutskever et al provided any acknowledgement of how they intend to \"cross the chasm\" from where we are now with LLMs to a model of understanding, or has it been mainly \"look what we did before, you should take a chance on us to make discontinuous breakthroughs in the future\"? reply nilkn 2 hours agoparentThe argument about AGI from LLMs is not based on the current state of LLMs, but on the rate of progress over the last 5+ years or so. It wasn't very long ago that almost nobody outside of a few niche circles seriously thought LLMs could do what they do right now. That said, my personal hypothesis is that AGI will emerge from video generation models rather than text generation models. A model that takes an arbitrary real-time video input feed and must predict the next, say, 60 seconds of video would have to have a deep understanding of the universe, humanity, language, culture, physics, humor, laughter, problem solving, etc. This pushes the fidelity of both input and output far beyond anything that can be expressed in text, but also creates extraordinarily high computational barriers. reply hn_throwaway_99 2 hours agorootparent> The argument about AGI from LLMs is not based on the current state of LLMs, but on the rate of progress over the last 5+ years or so. And what I'm saying is that I find that argument to be incredibly weak. I've seen it time and time again, and honestly at this point just feels like a \"humans should be a hundred feet tall based on on their rate of change in their early years\" argument. While I've also been amazed at the past progress in LLMs, I don't see any reason to expect that rate will continue in the future. What I do see the more and more I use the SOTA models is fundamental limitations in what LLMs are capable of. reply nilkn 1 hour agorootparentExpecting the rate of progress to drop off so abruptly after realistically just a few years of serious work on the problem seems like the more unreasonable and grander prediction to me than expecting it to continue at its current pace for even just 5 more years. reply hn_throwaway_99 15 minutes agorootparentThe problem is that the rate of progress over the past 5/10/15 years has not been linear at all, and it's been pretty easy to point out specific inflection points that have allowed that progress to occur. I.e. the real breakthrough that allowed such rapid progress was transformers in 2017. Since that time, the vast majority of the progress has simply been to throw more data at the problem, and to make the models bigger (and to emphasize, transformers really made that scale possible in the first place). I don't mean to denigrate this approach - if anything, OpenAI deserves tons of praise for really making that bet that spending hundreds of millions on model training would give discontinuous results. However, there are loads of reasons to believe that \"more scale\" is going to give diminishing returns, and a lot of very smart people in the field have been making this argument (at least quietly). Even more specifically, there are good reasons to believe that more scale is not going to go anywhere close to solving the types of problems that have become evident in LLMs since when they have had massive scale. So the big thing I'm questioning is that I see a sizable subset of both AI researchers (and more importantly VC types) believing that, essentially, more scale will lead to AGI. I think the smart money believes that there is something fundamentally different about how humans approach intelligence (and this difference leads to important capabilities that aren't possible from LLMs). reply machiaweliczny 20 minutes agorootparentprevHappy to review this in 5 years reply ldjkfkdsjnv 1 hour agorootparentprev10 years of progress is a flash in the pan of human progress.

Compute scaling is not at all similar to biological scaling. reply ldjkfkdsjnv 1 hour agorootparentprevIf its true that predicting the next word can be turned into predict the next pixel. And that you could run a zillion hours of video feed into that, I agree. It seems that the basic algorithm is there. Video is much less information dense than text, but if the scale of compute can reach the 10s of billions of dollars, or more, you have to expect that AGI is achievable. I think we will see it in our lifetimes. Its probably 5 years away reply nilkn 1 hour agorootparentI feel like that's already been demonstrated with the first-generation video generation models we're seeing. Early research already shows video generation models can become world simulators. There frankly just isn't enough compute yet to train models large enough to do this for all general phenomena and then make it available to general users. It's also unclear if we have enough training data. Video is not necessarily less information dense than text, because when considered in its entirety it contains text and language generation as special cases. Video generation includes predicting continuations of complex verbal human conversations as well as continuations of videos of text exchanges, someone flipping through notes or a book, someone taking a university exam through their perspective, etc. reply petulla 2 hours agoparentprevIlya has discussed this question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEUclZdj_Sc reply hn_throwaway_99 1 hour agorootparentThank you very much for posting! This is exactly what I was looking for. On one hand, I understand what he's saying, and that's why I have been frustrated in the past when I've heard people say \"it's just fancy autocomplete\" without emphasizing the awesome capabilities that can give you. While I haven't seen this video by Sutskever before, I have seen a very similar argument by Hinton: in order to get really good at next token prediction, the model needs to \"discover\" the underlying rules that make that prediction possible. All that said, I find his argument wholly unconvincing (and again, I may be waaaaay stupider than Sutskever, but there are other people much smarter than I who agree). And the reason for this is because every now and then I'll see a particular type of hallucination where it's pretty obvious that the LLM is confusing similar token strings even when their underlying meaning is very different. That is, the underlying \"pattern matching\" of LLMs becomes apparent in these situations. As I said originally, I'm really glad VCs are pouring money into this, but I'd easily make a bet that in 5 years that LLMs will be nowhere near human-level intelligence on some tasks, especially where novel discovery is required. reply JamesSwift 1 hour agorootparentWatching that video actually makes me completely unconvinced that SSI will succeed if they are hinging it on LLM... He puts a lot of emphasis on the fact that 'to generate the next token you must understand how', when thats precisely the parlor trick that is making people lose their minds (myself included) with how effective current LLMs are. The fact that it can simulate some low-fidelity reality with _no higher-level understanding of the world_, using purely linguistic/statistical analysis, is mind-blowing. To say \"all you have to do is then extrapolate\" is the ultimate \"draw the rest of the owl\" argument. reply machiaweliczny 15 minutes agorootparentprevThey might never work for novel discovery but that probably can be handled by outside loop or online (in-context) learning.

One thing to emphasize, I'm not saying the \"understanding\" that humans seem to possess isn't just some lower level statistical process - I'm not \"invoking a soul\".

One might believe that Ilya's research was genuinely critical to OpenAI's current situation. If one takes that premise, three potential corollaries follow: (1) OpenAI will struggle to produce future research breakthroughs without Ilya; (2) OpenAI will struggle to materially move beyond its current product lineup and variations thereof without said future research breakthroughs; (3) a startup led by Ilya could overcome both (1) and (2) with time. An alternative sequence of reasoning places less emphasis on Ilya specifically and uses Ilya as an indicator of research health. Repeat (1), (2), and (3) above, but replace \"Ilya\" with something like \"strong and healthy fundamental research group\". In this version, Ilya's departure is taken as indication that OpenAI no longer has a strong and healthy fundamental research group but that the company is \"compromised\" by relentless feature roadmaps for current products and their variations. That does not mean OpenAI will fail, but in this perspective it might mean that OpenAI is not well positioned to capture future research breakthroughs and the products that they will generate. From my perspective, it's just about impossible to know how true these premises really are. And that's what makes it a bet or gamble rather than anything with any degree of assurance. To me, just as likely is the scenario where it's revealed that Ilya is highly ineffective as a generalist leader and that research without healthy tension from the business goes nowhere. reply m4rtink 3 hours agorootparentprevAdd that the tracks have not even been built &trains purchased and we are back at google old railway craze/bubble!

And I believe their only VC round before going public was an $8 investment from Kleiner Perkins. But they were a company who proved their viability early on, had a real product with rapid revenue growth before getting any VC $$. I’d say this SSI round is more similar to Webvan, who went public with a valuation of $4.8 billion, and at that time had done a grand total of $395K in sales, with losses over $50 million. I’m sure there are good investments out there for AI companies that are doing R&D and advancing the state of the art. However, a $1 billion investment at a $5 billion valuation, for a company with zero product or revenue, just an idea, that’s nuts IMO, and extremely similar to the type of insanity we saw during the dot com bubble. Even more so given that SSI seemingly don’t even want to be a business - direct quote from Ilya: > This company is special in that its first product will be the safe superintelligence, and it will not do anything else up until then … It will be fully insulated from the outside pressures of having to deal with a large and complicated product and having to be stuck in a competitive rat race.

Transformer networks are dramatically dumber than lizards, and multimodal LLMs based on transformers are not capable of understanding what numbers are.

They can learn 5 x 3 = 15 without learning ***** **** ******* ***** = ***** = ******* ***** ****** * And this generalizes to almost every sentence an LLM can regurgitate. reply WithinReason 2 hours agorootparentThe latter can be learned from \"statistical correlations in text\", just like Ilya said. reply SpicyLemonZest 3 hours agorootparentprevWhich basic counting tests do they still fail? Recent examples I've seen fall well within the range of innumeracy that people routinely display. I feel like a lot of people are stuck in the mindset of 10 years ago, when transformers weren't even invented yet and state-of-the-art models couldn't identify a bird, no matter how much capabilities advance. reply aithrowaway1987 2 hours agorootparent> Recent examples I've seen fall well within the range of innumeracy that people routinely display. Here's GPT-4 Turbo in April botching a test almost all preschoolers could solve easily: https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_pr... I have not used LLMs since 2023, when GPT-4 routinely failed almost every counting problem I could think of. I am sure the performance has improved since then, though \"write an essay with 250 words\" still seems unsolved. The real problem is that LLM providers have to play a stupid game of whack-a-mole where an enormous number of trivial variations on a counting problem need to be specifically taught to the system. If the system was capable of true quantitative reasoning that wouldn't be necessary for basic problems. There is also a deception is that \"chain of thought\" prompting makes LLMs much better at counting. But that's cheating: if the LLM had quantitative reasoning it wouldn't need a human to indicate which problems were amenable to step-by-step thinking. (And this only works for O(n) counting problems, like \"count the number of words in the sentence.\" CoT prompting fails to solve O(nm) counting problems like \"count the number of words in this sentence which contain the letter 'e'\" For this you need a more specific prompt, like \"First, go step-by-step and select the words which contain 'e.' Then go step-by-step to count the selected words.\" It is worth emphasizing over and over that rats are not nearly this stupid, they can combine tasks to solve complex problems without a human holding their hand.) I don't know what you mean by \"10 years ago\" other than a desire to make an ad hominem attack about me being \"stuck.\" My point is that these \"capabilities\" don't include \"understands what a number is in the same way that rats and toddlers understand what numbers are.\" I suspect that level of AI is decades away. reply og_kalu 2 hours agorootparentYour test does not make any sense whatsoever because all GPT does when it creates an image currently is send a prompt to Dalle-3. Beyond that LLMs don't see words or letters (tokens are neither) so some counting issues are expected. But it's not very surprising you've been giving tests that make no sense. reply michaelt 2 hours agorootparentprev> Recent examples I've seen fall well within the range of innumeracy that people routinely display. But the company name specifically says \"superintelligence\" The company isn't named \"as smart as the average redditor, Inc\" reply SpicyLemonZest 2 hours agorootparentRight. They don't think that state-of-the-art models are already superintelligent, they're aiming to build one that is. reply HarHarVeryFunny 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah, it's not clear what companies like OpenAI and Anthropic mean when they predict AGI coming out of scaled up LLMs, or even what they are really talking about when they say AGI or human-level intelligence. Do they believe that scale is all you need, or is it an unspoken assumption that they're really talking about scale plus some set of TBD architectural/training changes?! I get the impression that they really do believe scale is all you need, other than perhaps some post-training changes to encourage longer horizon reasoning. Maybe Ilya is in this camp, although frankly it does seem a bit naive to discount all the architectural and operational shortcomings of pre-trained Transformers, or assume they can be mitigated by wrapping the base LLM in an agent that provides what's missing. reply michaelt 3 hours agorootparentprev> I honestly don't see a market for \"AI security\". I suspect there's a big corporate market for LLMs with very predictable behaviour in terms of what the LLM knows from its training data, vs what it knows from RAG or its context window. If you're making a chatbot for Hertz Car Hire, you want it to answer based on Hertz policy documents, even if the training data contained policy documents for Avis and Enterprise and Budget and Thrifty car hire. Avoiding incorrect answers and hallucinations (when appropriate) is a type of AI safety. reply EGreg 4 hours agoparentprevWelcome to capitalism. It’s all about your existing capital and connections. Capital attracts capital. reply theptip 4 hours agorootparentTalent attracts capital. Ilya is a legendary visionary, with a proven track record of turning billions into hundreds of billions. Of course he can raise unlimited money. reply EGreg 4 hours agorootparentThere is so much talent in the world that didn’t join PayPal and get silicon valley investors and go on to make billions of dollars and found other companies. The PayPal mafia includes Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, etc. They now parlayed that capital into more platforms and can easily arrange investments. Heck Peter Thiel even works with governments (Palantir) and got J D Vance on Trump’s ticket, while Elon might be in his admin. Kolomoisky got Zelensky elected in Ukraine, by launching a show about an unlikely guy who wins the presidency and named the party after the show. They call them oligarchs over there but it’s same thing. The first guy to 1 million followers on Twitter was Ashton Kutcher. He had already starred in sitcoms and movies for years. This idea that you can just get huge audiences and investments due to raw talent, keeps a lot of people coming to Hollywood and Silicon Valley to “make it” and living on ramen. But even just coming there proves the point — a talented rando elsewhere in the world wouldn’t even have access to the capital and big boys networks. They all even banked at the same bank! It’s all extremely centralized: https://community.intercoin.app/t/in-defense-of-decentralize... reply mgfist 2 hours agorootparentI never understood this line of reasoning, because it presumes that everyone should have access to the same opportunities. It's clearly silly once you throw a few counter examples: should a Private in the military be able to skip the ranks and be promoted straight to General? Should a new grad software dev be able to be promoted to lead engineer without getting any experience? Clearly there are reasons why opportunities are gated. > This idea that you can just get huge audiences and investments due to raw talent, keeps a lot of people coming to Hollywood and Silicon Valley to “make it” and living on ramen. But even just coming there proves the point — a talented rando elsewhere in the world wouldn’t even have access to the capital and big boys networks. All those people start somewhere though. Excluding nepotism, which is tangential point, all those people started somewhere and then grew through execution and further opening of opportunity. But it's not like they all got to where they are in one-shot. Taking your Ashton Kutcher example - yes he had a head start on twitter followers, but that's because he executed for years before on his career. Why would it make sense for some rando to rack up a million followers before he did? Talent will earn you opportunities, but it's not going to open the highest door until you've put in the time and work. Of course, it's not to say inequity or unequal access to opportunities doesn't exist in the world. Of course it does. But even in an ideal, perfectly equitable world, not everyone would have the same access to opportunities. So yes, it makes perfect sense that someone would give Ilya $1B instead of some smart 18 year old, even if that 18 year old was Ilya from the past. reply EGreg 21 minutes agorootparentPresumably the private and the general are in the SAME organization and yes, the avenues for advancement are available equally to all, it’s based on merit and the rules are clear. The analogy would be if the private could become a major overnight because they knew a guy. reply zeroonetwothree 2 hours agorootparentprevThose people weren’t handed that success. You are acting as if they were born billionaires, which is far from true. It’s not personally my goal to amass immense wealth and start giant companies (I would rather work minimally and live hedonically) but I am impressed by those that do so. reply EGreg 19 minutes agorootparentNo, I’m saying it was those who went to silicon valley and got lucky to strike up relationships with CAPITAL who made it. Overwhelmingly talent isnt sufficient. For most startups, the old boys network gets to choose who gets millions. And the next rounds a few people choose who will get billions. reply 38 more comments... GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "State of S3 - Your Laptop is no Laptop anymore - a personal Rant 29 October 2023 Laptops, Linux, Microsoft, Modern Standby, Dell, S0ix, S3, Lenovo, Portability, Connected Standby In this article, I aim to take a different approach. We will begin by defining a laptop according to my understanding. The I will share my personal history and journey to this point, as well as my current situation with my home and work laptops. Using this perspective, we will explore the current dysfunctionality of the standby function in modern laptops, followed by a discussion of why this feature still has relevance and right to exist. Finally, we will draw conclusions on what we can learn and take away from this. My Definition of a Laptop # It is a straightforward concept: a laptop, being a portable computer, should allow for easy use wherever one goes. It is a machine that can be taken along while working, then by closing the lid put to sleep for later use. At a later time, it should allow you to pick up where you left off. However, in recent times, achieving this seemingly straightforward goal has become increasingly difficult to achieve. If you find this hard to believe, stay tuned for more. My Situation and Point of View # So, without further ado, let me begin by laying out my perspective. Throughout my professional and educational career, I have used a wide range of servers, desktops and laptops. In my first semester at university, I began using Linux exclusively on my laptops. I was fortunate to own a Lenovo Thinkpad E470 during that period, which offered excellent Linux support. However, this decision has had a major impact on my choice of laptops in the future. Linux support for specific components was substandard back then and remains so today. As of today, Network Cards and dedicated Graphics Cards in Combination with internal ones (e.g. Nvidia Optimus) remain the typical pain points. But issues such as the requirement for complex drivers due to the current \"Windows Hello\"-certified IR webcams and array microphones were not present in the past. Therefore, as Lenovo was consistently praised for their exceptional Linux support, I continued purchasing their Thinkpads such as the X240 or X380. I only made minor adjustments, such as switching out the Wifi-NIC for an inexpensive Intel one. My previous laptops were adequately powered Linux machines, which were reliable wherever I went. My first work laptop, the Dell XPS 15 9570, was a continuation of this trend. Despite encountering a minor obstacle regarding the proprietary fingerprint reader, which required non-existent proprietary drivers, everything functioned seamlessly. With more time spent on the road and working from home due to Covid, than at a docking station in the office, I have certainly enjoyed the smooth, pain-free experience. As I currently have another XPS 15 9570 for personal use, I can confirm that S3 is still supported at the time of writing. This is evident from the command output below, indicated by [deep].[2] $ cat /sys/power/mem_sleep s2idle [deep] Another non-existent issue were sleep problems. Until they hit me at the moment i received my new Work-Laptop, which was a Dell XPS 15 9500. Let me clarify - the sleep issues are not linked to Linux and continue to occur even with my current Dell XPS 17 9720. The Status Quo # What happened and why? At first glance, it seems quite simple. For the past decade, Microsoft has been forcing the migration from S3 standby to S0 \"modern standby\". However, there's more to this than meets the eye. There are two questions to answer. What is modern standby and how is it implemented? Why did Microsoft force the migration to \"modern Standby\" if it breaks standby? The technical Aspects # Traditional Sleep requires all system hardware and software components to work together. The operating system must support Sleep, as well as the hardware (e.g. CPU) and the BIOS/UEFI. According to the UEFI to Hardware Interface Standard (ACPI), this usual form of sleep is referred to as S3. S3 is a Sleep State in which all system components, except for the RAM and CPU Cache, are powered off.[4] This is a good compromise between power consumption and the time required to resume from sleep. However, it is important to note that the CPU is completely powered off. Microsoft began rolling out \"Modern Standby\" (or S0ix) in 2012, with the ultimate goal of replacing S3 sleep. The aim is to provide similar or improved energy savings to those of S3. However, unlike S3, S0ix keeps the CPU and necessary system components active. S0ix sets the CPU to a low-power idle state to reduce power usage when not in operation. But why is my CPU being used when sleeping? This is where the \"modern\" aspect of \"modern sleep\" comes into play. With the rise of smartphones and tablets, we have become accustomed to waking up quickly to get notifications, download updates or activate voice assistant services. Microsoft aims to replicate this functionality with S0ix.[1] Your computer should be able to allow for the usage of Cortana and receive Windows Updates during Sleep mode, among other features. This introduction of functionality during sleep state, is the reason why Microsoft describes S3 as \"Legacy Sleep\".[1] Our story would end at this point if it weren't for the complications that arise from S0ix, as indicated previously. The Problems # S0ix would be great if it worked. But unfortunately it does not - laptops die from overheating, draining their battery in the process.[1] This issue is not limited to Linux, as Dell officially warns to power down your Laptop before placing it in a backpack.[7] Which brings us back to my Definition of a Laptop from above. This kind of defies the purpose of a Laptop in my opinion. So as Microsoft themselves enforced S0ix upon us and Intel states compatibility, the cause of our problems must be the manufacturers! But Microsoft Surface Devices suffer from the same overheating and battery drain issues as well.[8] It seems that even more than a decade after the migration away from legacy sleep started, there is still work left to do, smoothing out even the roughest edges. And due to the involvement of many system components, the fixes need to be applied in the OS/Kernel, ACPI/UEFI, CPU from every vendor along the chain. But we can still use S3 sleep, can we? This is the biggest bummer in my opinion, with the migration to S0ix Laptop manufacturers have began deprecating S3. This has lead to them stopping to fix bugs and retain functionality.[2] In the case of Dell, this has straight up lead to the complete removal of S3 from the UEFI.[3] So now we have non-portable Laptops with broken S0ix and removed or broken S3. Takeaway # We can only achieve advancement in regards to Sleep by adopting a new Standard which promises great features. Therefore we need a supporter with huge market influence that can bring a potential standard to the market. This definitely works in regard to Microsoft and i wholeheartedly support their chase of improvements. Their aim with S0ix is relatable and can somewhat be compared to Apples move to force USB-C on everyone - which is great and a necessity to be done by a market leader. But in Contrast, Apple kept the legacy Lightning and even brought back Magsafe (and if it only were to milk the cashcow). All in All the current situation is unfeasible. I am not certain if the current problems are related to the Limitations of x86 in comparison to ARM (A potential article could explore those). But i can not accept a Laptop that constantly dies from overheating or greets me with a drained battery in a working environment. Fortunately, S3 is still supported by CPU and some Laptop Manufacturers. Therefore Consumers have the option to state their disapproval with the current state of S0ix by buying Laptops that still support S3.

Not because it's such a terrible idea per se. You can debate that if you like. I hate it because it fundamentally changes the behavior behind an existing API (lid close, suspend button, or ACPI S3 trigger, take your pick) without warning, and in most cases, without the ability to get the old behavior back. Regardless of a valid use case for \"modern standby\", there is DEFINITELY a use case for \"old suspend to RAM\" and \"old hybrid suspend to RAM\", which have de facto been blown away by the change. I have no problem with adding a new sleep state that makes sense for other users. Go ahead and add S22 for that exotic sleep state manufacturing robots use between shifts. S344 for bluetooth devices waiting for reconnection. Whatever, I don't care. But don't replace an existing PRIMARY UI PATTERN with them. To be fair this is not on microsoft for inventing S0, or even pushing for it for windows devices. It's on device manufacturers like Dell and Lenovo for dropping S3 from UEFI in favor of it. reply beAbU 8 hours agoparentI learned about this workaround a while back on some throwaway comment on a youtube video, and from what I can tell it really works. I never bothered to really look into system logs or whatever to verify what was going on. But in a nutshell, unplug your laptop before you close the lid. Windows does not suspend to modern standby when that happens. I always had an overcooked and dead laptop at the other end of my commute, which went away when I started unplugging first. Now my windows machine can go literal days in sleep mode without really impacting remaining battery that much. reply dathinab 6 hours agorootparentwhich points to a absurdity of s0, it seems to consistently miss or have bugs in things I would expect to be core aspects like - monitoring if power is unpluged - monitoring if battery level sings below threshold - monitor CPU temperature and take appropriate actions, like transitioning to \"classical\" S3 or better hybrid S3 it's totally a misterious for me how that doesn't work well even 10 years later I mean bugs which idk. unexpectedly drain a bit more battery etc. are to be expected but I would expect the UEFI to be like \"uh that's too much CPU heat lets stop here\", \"uh that's draining the batter too fast let's stop\", \"uh only 40% batter better not even try anything\". And sure you want hello to work even withIt's on device manufacturers like Dell and Lenovo for dropping S3 from UEFI in favor of it. Note that even CPU manufacturers no longer provide firmware development support for making S3 work on recent series of CPUs. (Apparently some get an exception, as I’ve heard of some laptops from large brands that are sold with Linux and do have S3 support in the firmware.) reply dacryn 9 hours agorootparentwhy should they spend engineering effort it their target platform (windows) doesn't really support it? You can't blame Intel for this one reply Abishek_Muthian 8 hours agoparentprevHow do you hibernate with zram file? Is a seperate swap partition necessary for hibernating? Even if I create 200% swap file, I get `Call to Hibernate failed: Not enough suitable swap space for hibernation available on compatible block devices and file systems` on fedora 40. reply RealStickman_ 5 hours agorootparentYou can't hibernate with zram, the kernel has no way of distinguishing zram swap and normal swap space. reply Abishek_Muthian 1 hour agorootparentI've concluded that it's a HW driver bug after trying out creating swap file, adding resume device and offset to grub; even tried setting SELinux to permissive. It tries to go into hibernate but immediately wakes up. There are others in Fedora forum who have had successful hibernate with Zram & swapfile. I didn't find anyone else with my laptop Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 (2023) with successful Hibernate either on our Linux discord. reply immibis 10 hours agoparentprevDevice manufacturers just want windows to run. And why wouldn't they? They sell the devices with windows. If windows doesn't use S3 then S3 never gets tested, whether it's present or not. So it doesn't work, whether it's present or not, and you can't use it, whether it's present or not. reply Arnt 10 hours agorootparentWhat's the market share of windows on laptops these days, 20% perhaps? I don't know, but I know that Chromebooks and Macos are ahead, far ahead. Once upon a time, there were fifty times as many Windows laptops as Linux (by which I mean debian, mint, etc) and Linux was ignorable. Now the factor is closer to ten, and I find it difficult to believe that device manufacturers simply ignore that. If they don't support S3, there likely is a better reason than the dominance of Windows. reply Woeps 9 hours agorootparentMight I ask where you get these numbers from? I don't like using Windows, and I would like them to be a smaller player. But if I search for \"desktop\" operating systems share world wide I get numbers that are way way different. some show that Windows is around 70%. reply nine_k 9 hours agorootparentI read \"close to ten\" as ten Windows machines per one Linux machine, so Windows would be 91%. 70% would be terrific news, mote than one fifth. reply Arnt 8 hours agorootparent91% of what? Windows has been losing market share to tablets and macs. Anyway, if you as CTO tell the CEO that testing with Linux will get you access to x% of the market, the CEO answer will obviously depend on x. As Windows loses market share to tablets and macs, x increases, and it becomes less plausible to suggest that vendors are simply ignoring Linux because it's small. reply rfoo 4 hours agorootparent> Windows has been losing market share to tablets and macs. We are talking about laptops. Not tablets. Windows has been losing market share to Macbook-s at about one percent each year, so good luck reaching your 20% in your lifetime. reply Arnt 3 hours agorootparentGP talked about the choices of device manufacturers. If device manufacturers consider the sales potential for a new laptop model, are they going to ignore the competition by tablets? How about convertibles or tablets with a keyboard? Consumers consider them somewhat interchangeable (\"I bought a Surface to replace my old laptop\"), so they IMO can't be excluded. And if you don't exclude them, then the share of windows laptops is now so low that adding linux support is a noticeable increase in the sales potential of that hardware. Device manufacturers are quite cynical IMO. Would you personally take on extra testing burden to increase the sales potential for a new model by 0.25%? 0.5%? 1%? 2%? 4%? 8%? I postulate that the device manufacturers wouldn't bother for the numbers at the low end, but if they don't do it now, then they have a better reason than \"windows doesn't require it\" (quoting from GP). reply consteval 3 hours agorootparentprev> We are talking about laptops. Not tablets. I'd argue that the deficiencies in Windows as a laptop OS has led to some people choosing iPads and the like when they would've chosen a Windows laptop. Obviously, a tablet and a laptop have divergent usecases, but there's some overlap. And for those consumers that exist in the overlap, I think many (maybe most?) would rather choose an iPad. Microsoft kind of saw the writing on the walls with this and that's how we got the whole Windows 8 fiasco. reply Arnt 8 hours agorootparentprevFrom the visitors to a large company's web sites. High-traffic sites, general public with a little bit of skew towards high earners, nothing can be named. reply Woeps 4 hours agorootparentReading your other comments I see where you're getting from. And if you're indeed adding phones and tables Apple and MS are both at a ~20% (android has an overwhelming +50% by the way) from the same sources I looked at before. If you just look at \"desktop/laptop\" Windows still reigns supreme. Now the question is could be: should you include those for this discussion or not? Yes because lots of people use them. No because the conversation was about laptops. regardless, I now understand your point reply mananaysiempre 9 hours agorootparentprev> I know that Chromebooks and Macos are ahead, far ahead [of Windows]. Perhaps in the US, though I doubt it. Chromebooks are not even sold in a lot of places. Apple products are much more expensive (relatively and absolutely) in the rest of the world. reply Arnt 5 hours agorootparentSo what? Pretend that you know someone at your bank who can answer the question \"what devices do people use for your online banking?\" You don't need to really ask, you already know the answer: For a while it was overwhelmingly Windows on PCs/laptops, now Windows has been pushed to a minority position by smartphones, tablets and macbooks. You might say that those don't count, but I think that for a device manufacturer they do count. I have private and work smartphones and laptops, mine are made by three different manufacturers, all three make both phones, tablets and laptops. AFAICT that's typical. There are exceptions (such as Dell) but overall, the markets overlap so much that most manufacturers need to regard it as one market with different nïches. reply wavemode 4 hours agorootparentThey are not one market, in any sense. The vast majority of adults in the country own both a computer and a phone. I'm not sure how they could possibly be treated as competing with one another. Within the market of personal computers (not the fictional market of personal computers combined with other devices that aren't personal computers), Windows has very dominant market share. reply consteval 3 hours agorootparent> They are not one market, in any sense. I agree, but there is a venn diagram here. Many use cases are covered by both products. As time goes on, the venn diagram gets closer to a circle. An iPhone of 2008 was a niche device, but nowadays you can complete 99% of tasks completely on an iPhone (yes I made up 99%, just pretend it's some number higher than it once was). I think, for most adults, their primary personal computer is a smartphone. Many, not sure of the numbers here, don't own a laptop or desktop at all. They may have one for work, though. reply Arnt 1 hour agorootparentI'm curious… if many uses cases are covered by two products, don't those two products compete? If two products compete, how can you think that they're not in the same market in any sense? To my mind, my ultralight private laptop is more similar to a many tablets and two-in-ones than to the 16\" Macbook Pro that I was issued from my employer. Saying that the two laptops are in the same market and the tablets/two-in-ones aren't in that same market… just doesn't make sense to me. reply raverbashing 10 hours agoparentprev> To be fair this is not on microsoft for inventing S0, or even pushing for it for windows devices.

It's like they don't even use their products Oh who am I kidding, if they used they would notice all the bloatware on it and the shoddy build quality, etc reply snakeyjake 4 hours agoparentprevModern standby has existed for longer than ACPI did when modern standby was introduced. Yes I know ACPI was ratified in 1996 but it didn't ACTUALLY exist until 1998 and I would argue it wasn't actually implemented until early 2000 for enterprise users and 2001 for consumers. Every single criticism, every single one, levied at modern standby was also made against pre-modern standby ACPI. In addition to that, tech luminaries too numerous to count ranted for years and years and years that ACPI was a secret evil plot by the NSA to I don't know, kidnap your dog or something. That's not an exaggeration. That actually happened 20+ years ago. > Modern PCs are horrible. ACPI is a complete design disaster in every way. But we're kind of stuck with it. If any Intel people are listening to this and you had anything to do with ACPI, shoot yourself now, before you reproduce. Linus Torvalds, 2003. https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7279 He's talking here about pre-modern standby ACPI, the standard everyone loves and misses today and writes long articles eulogizing. I'm going to chalk this up to people hating change for the sake of hating change. edit: I'm actually gonna chalk this up to hating for the sake of hating. I know, you know, and I know that you know that if old-skool BIOS was the standard, Hacker News would be flooded with 10,000 word Medium articles about how the evil tech companies are conspiring to keep our systems insecure so the NSA can kidnap our dogs and if pre-Modern Standby was the standard there'd be stories hating on that too. It's like how haxxors reminisce about the days when the CPU bus was exposed on a port or card-edge connector out the back of a machine and everything was \"so free and open\" but when a modern interface with 1/10,000,000,000th the number of vulnerabilities is introduced those same people hate on it. reply t-3 3 hours agorootparentNobody is mad that \"modern standby\" exists. We're mad that actual standby is no longer supported on modern hardware. It's very annoying to have to hibernate a laptop when you put it in a bag or else it will overheat and possibly crash. reply snakeyjake 3 hours agorootparent>It's very annoying to have to hibernate a laptop when you put it in a bag or else it will overheat and possibly crash. Quelle horreur! Unfortunately, none of my device suffer from this issue so I am forced to but imagine the torment you must go through on a daily basis. reply skrebbel 11 hours agoprevI struggled to get through the top half of this post, which is about various Thinkpad model types that the author had. But the second part, where the author explains the various sleep modes and what it means, was very informative & worth a read! I've personally always solved this problem by enabling \"Hibernate\" (not sure if that's a Windows-specific term) which writes the entire RAM contents to a file and then shuts down completely. The downside is that it takes a few seconds to boot (impressively few seconds on a modern machine, actually), but still, the laptop doesn't come on instantly. But I like knowing that there's no chance the laptop somehow turns on and overheats/drains in the backpack, because it's completely off. This doesn't take away from the author's rant at all, the idea that a sleep mode would need to support notifications or updates (!) is absurd. A good sleep mode would need to only support \"minimum power usage\" and \"fast wake-up\" and nothing else. But with MS's usual mix of excellence and absurd stupidity, that appears to not exist, and \"hibernate\" is to me an acceptable compromise. My understanding is that Macbooks have gotten this right for decades already, pretty nuts that PCs lag behind so much. reply Lvl999Noob 10 hours agoparentI used to be able to just close the lid on my laptop and forget about it for days. Nowadays with the new laptop provided by my employer, if I close the lid wrong, it doesn't even go to sleep and the battery drains completely (which is... understandable, I guess, since it didn't go to sleep) but even if I do all the rituals and it goes to sleep, the battery still drains away within a few hours. I can't full charge my laptop at the end of the workday, keep my VS and stuff open, and just the laptop to sleep. I have to shut it down properly and then start everything back up again the next morning. reply soco 9 hours agorootparentI noticed that my HP only really goes to sleep if I close the lid WHEN UNPLUGGED (Windows settings get ignored or whatever reason).

What’s double weird is that, if I close it without hibernating it, not only does it not lock the laptop but it seems to prevent the “lock after x minutes inactivity” setting kicking in. Which seems like a huge security problem. reply Izkata 1 hour agorootparentThat happened to Ubuntu on my personal laptops, and occasionally I'd notice the mouse cursor was on a different position than when I closed the lid - I think the screen was somehow triggering the touchpad and that kept it awake/unlocked. reply tda 10 hours agoparentprevThis is one the primary reasons I use a MacBook (the other being the trackpad).

My Intel MBP would keep running or doing something in my backpack such that the battery would be lower and it would be hot. It wasn’t always and the Intel MBP worked better than any windows computer I had used before it but still noticeable. Sometimes after not using it for a day, closed and unplugged, it would be dead. In contrast, my M-chip MBP never gets hot and the battery is reminiscent of my iPad.

In the past where a computer would be connected to the corporate network all the time you could usually get Wake-on-LAN to work so you could boot computers at night to apply updates and ensure that users weren't waiting around forever. With laptops and people working remotely you need a new way to ensure that the bulk of the updates happen when they won't interfere with users trying to work - this is the solution. Microsoft may well tout additional potential benefits, but that's more about selling it to consumers so they don't complain about changes as much. And, of course, some manufacturers do a better job than others at implementing this. --I haven't had a problem with any of my Lenovo laptops or even the Surface laptop.

I believe iOS is capable of flushing most cleartext data on suspend until the passcode is reentered, so suspend should be as good as shutdown; I don’t know if macOS can do it. On desktop Linux it’s theoretically possible with systemd-homed, but in practice that needs desktop-environment support that’s as far as I know does not exist, so shutting down is more secure. I can’t remember anything about Android either way except for some features for disabling the USB port in some alternative firmware. On Windows with a typical TPM-only setup, powering off is probably just as bad as suspending, because just powering the machine back on is enough for it to helpfully unlock everything. If you do need to enter a BitLocker passphrase at boot, then you’re in the same situation as typical desktop Linux, so powering off is more secure. reply JonChesterfield 9 hours agorootparentprevIt's probably better to have a switched off laptop stolen than a suspended one reply prmoustache 10 hours agorootparentprev> I suspect that the real reason for this change is to ensure that Windows gets updated even if the laptop is sleeping, and that this is a change that enterprise customers have asked for.

So this push for \"always on\" bullshit is not what enterprises asked for. Microsoft wants mac/ios/android-like experience, but just can't deliver such thing due to hardware fragmentation. I never understood why microsoft doesn't go full apple and only allows certain top-tier features on surface laptops or other hardware they own from top to bottom.

A lot of the theoretical benefits of it, IMO, have been relatively theoretical. Perhaps Windows updates, but the computers I've used with Modern Standby still have to spend time installing updates when awake. I cannot imagine what the benefit of receiving notifications and other information like this on a Windows system would be. As far as I know, very, very few apps are programmed for the native \"App\" development flow (or even to use the notifications api) as opposed to \"desktop\" apps, and the number only gets smaller as you go into long tail enterprise apps. Perhaps this was designed for Outlook, but I think the use case is dubious. Of course, there are millions of laptops in the wild, many of which are undoubtedly used by the people who work on Windows. Every time I find the laptop closed and running its fans, or find a computer in a bag that is slightly warm near the CPU (expected behaviour of working Modern Standby), I wonder whether it's just my computer or if it's every single one of them out there. Do people just accept that their computer has to be either shut down or will have an unknown amount of remaining power? It seems like there would have been a huge push to get this fixed if it was really broken, but I rarely hear users talking about it.

I guess the value is for enterprise users because the ecosystem is so bad. When I return from sleep on my laptop, my VPN is disconnected and can't reconnect itself automatically as I need to go through the auth + 2FA phase. I am also logged of all Azure AD authenticated web apps and Microsoft web apps like Teams and Outlook are so bad they don't automatically sign in back when you have signed on on other Azure AD resources. I haven't started my corporate laptop on the original windows 10 for years so I can't compare but I imagine a \"modern standby\" would have some keepalive on the VPN connections and apps like teams so they don't sign you out? But in the end this is kind of useless on those Dell laptops because it drains the battery so fast and they have such a low battery life that you just want to shut them down if they are not connected to their docking statino. I guess it serves the people who are on-prem and close the lid to go from one meeting room to another. But when I was working on-prem I would just configure it to just lock the laptop and would use the sleep shortcut to put the laptop to a normal sleep.

Why is there ever a time when I _must_ reboot?

Other examples that make me wonder if it's mostly because people haven't demanded better: - Enormous updates for all kinds of things (gigabytes for a bug fix release) because differential updates aren't pervasive. - Windows updates where a huge amount of work is done during the \"rebooting\" phase (why can't most of this be done before reboot?) - Absolutely atrocious power management on pretty much anything that's not a MacBook, and even not perfect on those.

Unless something gets corrupted or wrong on the way and it does not boot to the OS at all, in which case good luck. Note that security updates are independent of the OS updates (or should be).

S0ix was a joke when introduced years ago and remains one, but it's not funny to laugh at it anymore because its existence eventually killed the actual sleep state an user expects. There is, without an ounce of doubt, no benefit for an user to have their laptop device continue operating when it's expected to be \"sleeping\" without intentional, conscious instruction to resume work. Some of the proclaimed advantages to it I distinctly remember were \"receiving emails\" and \"automatic updates when the device is not in use\", and while the former is mostly useless because it's not a smartphone, the latter is actively harmful to an user's interests when unprompted. Hibernation on linux and windows (where it's secretly kept away for whatever reason since 8 or so) is far more predictable with any modern sabotaged devices missing S3 support, and modern drives are performant and large enough that it's not going to make much of a difference, at least for pauses that one expects to last more than an hour or two.

Annoyingly when I enable S3 on my P1 Gen 5 Windows 11 give me a whole bunch of warnings in the security center. Seems like S3 itself is incompatible with some modern firmware protections. But frankly, I don't care whether it's S0 or S3. I just want it to sleep, and I don't want the OS to NOT offer me the options to say 'don't do stuff in sleep mode' reply phh 6 hours agoprevThe \"fun\" part is that smartphones/tablets implement those features with S3 (CPU off, RAM in self-refresh). Updates? Well here is an RTC to wake-up. Voice control? Well here is an always on audio dsp. Remote wake-up? Well here is a WiFi frame filter to trigger IRQ. I think it isn't tractable on most laptops because of all the hardware that has been onloaded to software, and the hardware isn't capable of those hardware filtering, and partly OS and drivers are probably to blame too. An embesded OS takes under 1s to wakeup, so even managing TCP KeepAlives wih resume/suspend is realistic on those devices. Not so much when wakeup takes 10s. reply dailykoder 11 hours agoprevI don't really understand what the fuzz about fast boot is. Why can't most people just wait a few seconds? It's not like boot still takes minutes. I almost always shut down my laptop. This serves me two purposes: 1) It saves power 2) I always start with a fresh session, keeping distractions at a minimum and having habits to \"finish\" the current task I am working at. (I do the same with browsers for example. Here I even less frequently save my session). There are a few exceptions where I know I'll just take a quick break and resume work shortly, but they are rare. No, you don't have to have everything always available within milliseconds. No, I don't need notifications always on (so I guess I agree with the author here). But maybe just different tastes, different habits. I don't know if this is true, but I talked about a broader topic along those lines with my therapist recently and she was like: 'We invent all these smart things to save time and have more for ourselves, but in reality people have less time, because then they just want to put more tasks into the same timespan'. I have absolutely no idea if there is any truth to that, but it feels true on my empirical observations. Embrace slowness! reply jraph 11 hours agoparent> 1) It saves power Shutting down and booting are intensive operations, it's likely that for short enough periods of time, sleep is actually more power-efficient if it works well.

I have one Samsung laptop with an Intel chipset that more or less goes standby reliably. Sometimes it still messes up and it's dead when you open it. But mostly it's fine and it's gotten more rare with recent kernel versions. The fingerprint reader is pretty much the only thing that doesn't work on that laptop and probably never will because it's a cheap Chinese thing with some proprietary firmware. The core issue is that the firmware in most laptops is just ancient garbage and nobody seems to really care about it. Apple has full ownership over their own firmware so it's less of an issue for them (though it still has issues). But most chip manufacturers servicing the wintel laptop market treat software as an afterthought. They aren't very good at it and they just put in the minimum effort that they can get away with. So, it's all proprietary, poorly designed, decades old, etc. If it breaks they bang on it until it sort of works again (windows only). Laptop makers then make things worse by just buying a lot of cheap components. Synaptic seems popular for touch pads, for example. My Samsung has one. It's not good. I've actually never come across anything made by them that wasn't garbage. With Linux slowly creeping up in market share on desktops, it's something that could start changing. Most Linux users are very selective in what they buy and there are certain brands that are just so hopeless that people actively avoid them. Lenovo bought a good reputation from IBM when they acquired their laptop division. That's ages ago but they sort of nurtured that and it's probably helped a lot. It's not rocket science to just make sure things work on Linux. My work laptop is a macbook. The hardware is just miles ahead of the competition. It's just not even close. Everything else is a major downgrade. I bought that Samsung to replace a mac because I was waiting for the M1 to come out when my old laptop died. I worked on that thing for half a year. Going back to a mac was just such major upgrade in every way possible. You forget how great they are. Software wise I'm actually fine with Linux.

Luckily Windows \"fast startup\" mitigates the pain - it doesn't take very long for it to unsuspend-from-disk and reach a usable state again, with apps still open etc. No idea what Linux would do here. I actually have Linux on my previous work laptop (Elitebook 840 G6) and \"proper\" suspend works just fine on it. reply jitl 6 hours agoprevThis sounds totally nuts. I guess I’m happy to be running a laptop where when I close the lid, it will sleep and have battery when I open the lid, in an hour or in 2 days. I thought that was the basic requirement for being a laptop? The essential feature. It’s so surprising to hear things have gone backwards in the Windows world. My suggestion to anyone dealing with annoying power management is to get a MacBook Pro (you can get tons of ram, we are ordering 96gb models for our engineers) and run your preferred OS in a full screen VM if you don’t like MacOS. I did this for years because I don’t trust Linux to manage battery or reliably pair with Bluetooth devices (especially Bluetooth audio), but I much preferred Linux window management and access to Docker. Parallels runs Windows quite well, and either that, Virtualbox, or the various apps that are thin layers over the system Hypervisor.framework all do the trick. reply sakjur 11 hours agoprev> Therefore Consumers have the option to state their disapproval with the current state of S0ix by buying Laptops that still support S3.

I remember similar issues with S3 back then. You had to jump through many hoops on FreeBSD and Linux to make it work without draining your battery while still being able to resume from standby successfully. Disabling some drivers, but not others, etc. Thus, a faulty implementation of a device or driver is not to blame on the standby mode. FWIW, Modern Standby works fine on my Thinkpad X1 Titanium Yoga with Windows 11. The only device that drains more battery than necessary if not disabled is the Qualcomm WWAN modem. That stops once you disable it, like in the \"good old days\". So for me, it's nothing negative, but actually adds convenience because with Modern Standby, my device goes to sleep and resumes much faster than the devices ever did with S3. reply blkhawk 11 hours agoprevI see S3 as another victim of the enforced convergence of PC and mobile that MS did get into with Windows 8. On paper modernizing S3 made even sense since getting all the system components to work nicely with S3 is not an easy task. What wasn't thought off is that handling the same task in modern standby generally isn't easier. reply justinmayer 9 hours agoprevHaving owned countless Mac notebooks over the last 30 years — starting from the PowerBook 140 up through the M1 MacBook Pro — I can tell you with confidence that Apple has made the same sleep change shenanigans mentioned in OP’s article. It used to be that you could count on a sleeping Mac to stay asleep until you explicitly woke it up by opening the lid, pressing a key on the keyboard, or pressing the trackpad (or separate trackpad buttons — yes, those used to exist). Perhaps more importantly, you could count on the sleep function to have barely any effect on the Mac battery. I don’t recall when, but at some point over the aforementioned three decades, Apple started changing the terms of this sleep contract. It seems Apple decided that some functions should still be available when the Mac is “sleeping”, with no way to restore the previous behavior. As a result, random wake-ups are the new normal, replete with unexpected battery drainage. I have seen modern MacBooks go to “sleep” with an 80% charge at night, only to be rendered dead with a 0% battery level by morning. Does something this extreme happen often? No. But it never happened before. And moderate battery loss while sleeping? That happens very often on today’s MacBooks. Your mileage may very. And Apple probably continues to implement better computer sleep behavior than competing vendors. But I would argue that people who think MacBook sleep behavior is excellent… have never experienced how it behaved in the past. That behavior was superb. But sadly, I imagine most people have never experienced that excellence. reply ddmf 10 hours agoprevWe've had a have a few issues related to the move to modern sleep - in that \"shutdown\" is now hibernate (with fast boot enabled) - so any issues that would be fixed with a restart remain. With some machines, the modern sleep where it stays connected to the network can sometimes cause connection issues that aren't as obvious to the end user. In a lot of cases we disable fast boot, and disable modern sleep and the problem goes away - but having the ability to select which parts should be enabled and disabled, like how you get the option with PS5's rest mode, would be very useful - especially if controllable by GPO / Intune. reply lozenge 9 hours agoparentIf you choose Restart in Windows then it avoids Fast Boot and actually restarts. reply rationably 12 hours agoprevCan relate, try searching \"s0ix battery drain\". reply joshstrange 7 hours agoprev> But in Contrast, Apple kept the legacy Lightning and even brought back Magsafe (and if it only were to milk the cashcow).

I recently installed Windows on a laptop after a long time of only using it on a desktop. I thought I was going crazy - where had proper sleep gone ?! 'Luckily' hibernate only takes about 4x as long as sleep while still being just quick enough not to be too annoying. I agree with the author that it totally defies the purpose of a laptop. Another terrible move by Microsoft It is why I will fork out 2-3x for a Macbook, because apart from the screens being amazing, when I close the lid, I know it does exactly what 99.99999% of the population expects it to do, and I can safely put it in my bag. reply omgtehlion 10 hours agoparent> ...it does exactly what 99.99999% of the population expects it to do...

What about hibernate? Couldn't it be an alternative to the \"legacy sleep\"? reply shiroiushi 11 hours agoparentHibernate mode takes a long time to enter and exit, as it involves writing a lot of data to disk and then reading it back upon resuming. The whole point of Sleep mode is that it's fast: you just close the lid and you're in sleep mode, saving power. Then if you want to check something quickly, or resume your work, you just open the lid and in a few seconds or less, your computer is fully operational again. reply dammaj 9 hours agorootparentWell, you're right but of Sleep is impractical with S0 mode as explained, hibernate with slightly longer transition time may be acceptable.

This seems to have been fixed for a while now (say a year or so), but when the Intel machine was new, Windows would sometimes not wake up from sleep, or if did, the screen would be garbled. The AMD still has an issue where Windows will \"unexpectedly shutdown\" (according to the event log) during modern standby. This happens every single time I leave it on standby during the night.

Elle Griffin Sep 03, 2024 74 Share this post Mondragon as the new City-State www.elysian.press Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 88 Share Article voiceover 1× 0:00 -25:49 Mondragon Corporation is the largest group of worker cooperatives in the world. With 84 cooperatives in the industrial, financial, retail, and educational sectors, the group earned €11 billion in revenue last year with more than 70,500 workers. Each cooperative is owned and democratically run by its workers, who vote their leadership into office and share in the profits when their cooperatives do well. In fact, Mondragon works a lot like a federated nation-state made up of smaller city-states. Perhaps that’s why science fiction authors like Ursula Le Guin, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Cory Doctorow have all used the corporation as a model for the utopian nations in their books. Could we eventually create a capitalist paradise where democratically run companies use their profits for the good of their worker citizens? Could that even replace our existing governments? “Years ago our founders had this kind of vision—to have a ‘world cooperative economy,’” Germán Lorenzo, who works in community education, told me when I visited Mondragon’s headquarters. “An ideal utopia would be a full cooperative world—people own the means of production, there’s a fair distribution of wealth.” In 1956, one Catholic priest began building it—starting with the Basque Country. Subscribe Father José María Arizmendiarrieta was just 26 years old when he was sent to the parish of Arrasate-Mondragón for his first (and what would be only) assignment in 1941. It was just after the Spanish Civil War and the country was under the control of the nationalist dictator Franco. Arrasate was destitute with high levels of unemployment and economic hardship. People needed money, which meant they needed jobs. So Arizmendiarrieta created them. What started as one employee-owned business became a network of them as he and his followers kept starting new businesses and adding them to the network. They worked like an incubator, founding a university that would train entrepreneurs, then a bank that would fund their visions. They built manufacturing companies that would give them high-paying jobs, a housing company as they grew, and a preschool where their children could get an education while they worked. Each new startup arose out of the needs of the community, and each one was owned by its workers. Eventually, they bought up an entire mountain and expanded to neighboring cities. As they grew and joined the EU they became more competitive worldwide, founding tech companies and R&D facilities. Today, three out of every 10 cars use Mondragon components, 90% of the world’s aircraft use their technology solutions, 60% of the world’s trains are built using their machines, and more than a third of Europe’s solar panels are made using their technology. You can find Mondragon brands in Audi cars and Tour de France bikes, technologically advanced hospitals and electric vehicle charging stations, green energy power solutions and water management facilities. Mondragon has spread throughout the seven cities of the Alto Deba region. No matter what you do for work here you are probably working for a cooperative, and no matter what you spend money on you’re also supporting one. You might work as a computer engineer for a tech cooperative, deposit your paycheck into a cooperative bank, and spend it at a cooperative grocery store or on cooperative-built cars. Your home might be powered by a cooperative-run energy company, your children might attend a cooperative school or university, and your parents might live in a cooperative retirement community. As they say in the Basque Country: “Life is cooperatized here.” Over time, these cooperatives have federated together as Mondragon Corporation. Each cooperative is part of a larger division, and each division is part of the larger parent company. A cooperative that makes hubcaps, for example, might be part of the larger auto parts division, which is part of the larger Mondragon Corporation. The profits generated by each cooperative are put to work for the benefit of the greater whole. Each cooperative gives 14-40% of their gross profits to their division (depending on the division), and another 14% to their parent company. The rest are invested back in the cooperative (60% of net profits), distributed among their employees (30% of net profits), and donated to social organizations in their communities (10% of net profits). How cooperative profits are distributed The bulk of cooperative profits stay with the cooperative and its workers, but there are benefits to being part of the larger organizations. Divisions use surplus profits to account for losses within the group, and the Corporation uses half its revenue to invest in their businesses (and start new ones) and the other half to provide social services for workers. When the Spanish government issued a regulation in 1958 that cooperative owners would no longer qualify for the country’s social security program, Mondragon created its own. They founded Lagun Aro, a social welfare arm that provides pensions for workers and their families, as well as disability services when they can’t work. Eventually, it created its own healthcare service, providing medical care for workers and their families. When there was a massive downturn in the economy in the 1980s, 20 cooperatives were forced to close their doors, but other cooperatives in the portfolio were thriving so Mondragon just transferred people from one cooperative to another, paying for the education each worker needed to fulfill their new roles. On the whole, jobs rose. If workers can’t be relocated, Lagun Aro will pay a percentage of their salary for up to 24 months—though Lorenzo tells me this has never happened. The most recent cooperative to shut its doors was an appliance company that once had revenues of €1.3 billion. When Fagor shuttered 10 years ago, Mondragon had to relocate close to 2,000 employees from one cooperative to another, and they did. “In a crisis situation, where other companies send people home and they waste their time watching videos and smoking, what we do is train them inside, and retrain the force,” Lorenzo says. “People keep working. That's important.” As their founder used to say, “There are no useless people, only underutilized ones.” The area has become much wealthier as a result. “A large number of cooperative jobs are industrial so their income level is high,” cooperative communications officer Ander Etxeberria Otadui explained in a video series about the organization. “Studies that analyzed Alto Deba at the beginning of the 1970s already showed that the per capita income was significantly higher than average for the province. Today, it has one of the highest average incomes in the Basque country. Plus it’s more equal.” As a rule, the highest-paid workers at Mondragon cooperatives earn only six times more than the lowest-paid workers. A worker’s position on the payscale, between levels one and six, also determines their share of the profit-sharing pool. Lorenzo estimates that the president of Mondragon is the highest-paid position (level 6) with a salary of around €200,000. Managers and directors earn between €80,000 and €120,000. Workers buy into their cooperative when they become employees, investing up to €16,000 into a personal equity account. They pay 30% of that investment upfront, with the remainder taken out of their paychecks over following 2 to 7 years. After two years with the organization, workers become “members” and start earning interest on their investment at a rate of at least 7.5% annually. If the cooperative does well, they might earn much more than that. Workers can pull this money out of their accounts when they leave the cooperative or retire. “It’s a fact that the cooperative system uses wealth in a much more fair way,” Lorenzo says. “Our Gini Coefficient is similar to Sweden or Norway or Denmark, it’s very low. That means the cooperative system, in fact, is a much better way than the capital system for the world.1” When I asked, at an informational lecture, if people ever leave for better pay, Lorenzo said no one does. When another asked how they keep motivation high throughout employees' lengthy careers, Lorenzo recanted: “Your question is asked from the perspective of somebody who is working for somebody else. Here you are working for yourself. We have a higher level of self-consciousness.” If workers want to try something different they have the autonomy to move elsewhere. Lorenzo started his career in global purchasing and imports for Eroski, Mondragon’s grocery store brand. Eventually, he moved to Hong Kong where he spent four years working in business development for Intergroup Far East, Mondragon’s international sourcing office. When he returned to Spain, Lorenzo headed up the Asia-Pacific group for Mondragon Corporation. Craving a change of pace, he then moved to Mondragon University’s business school where he spent a couple of years helping with their entrepreneurship program. Now, he’s working in global public affairs and communications, developing Mondragon’s corporate diplomacy and internal communications. “I can’t say they didn’t give me room to move,” Lorenzo says. “My wife says they gave me too much.” Every cooperative in Mondragon’s portfolio is an essential business—these are manufacturing companies, energy companies, agricultural companies, medical equipment companies, banks. They grow our food and power our cities and build our transportation systems. Their research and development groups invent machines and robotics that improve our world. There are no fast fashion or telemarketing companies in their portfolio. This cooperative of cooperatives is run by workers who directly build the things society needs while directly benefiting their communities with the profits they earn making them. They are self-governing locally even as they compete globally, with plants around the world and products and services sold in 150 countries. The result is that Mondragon has created something of a self-sustaining government—and a pretty good one, I might add. Each cooperative functions like its own democracy, with workers functioning more like citizens. Cooperatives average 250 workers—if they grow much larger than that they are split into separate cooperatives with separate democracies. Every year, workers (internally called the “General Assembly”) meet to review prior years’ management, decide how to allocate profits or losses, and approve annual accounts. They vote their board of directors into office (called the “Governing Council”) who, in turn, vote their CEOs into office (called “General Managers”). General Managers hire their own executive team and make periodic reports to the Governing Council who can confer or revoke their powers as necessary. Positions of leadership serve a renewable four-year term and will be removed from office if they aren’t doing a good job. The parent company works similarly: “Congress” is an assembly of representatives from every cooperative. They vote for the “Standing Committee,” who appoints the “President,” the head of Mondragon. Each cooperative pays for workers’ education at Mondragon University, itself a cooperative in the Mondragon network. There’s even a bootcamp program for General Managers—a sort of entrepreneurial “CEO school”—where executives have the support they need to run financially successful companies, and have the opportunity to learn from executives at other cooperatives who have done so. Together, they’ve even formed a constitution: The “Rules of Congress” outlines the articles of their organization and includes the corporation’s strategic plan—or “socio-business policy”—which is prepared and voted on every four years. During the time of my visit, Congress was getting ready to meet about the organization's plans for 2025 to 2028. (Reminiscent of my essay: “We should vote for plans, not politicians.”) Each democratically-run organization is supported by the larger democratically-run Mondragon. Workers at Mondragon cooperatives are guaranteed a job and an income. They are taken care of when they can’t work, provided with universal healthcare if they get sick, receive universal education that trains them for any job, and are provided a pension when they retire. There is no unemployment, no poverty. No one is sitting around collecting handouts from everyone else, they are all actively working and contributing to the system. And unlike governments, the cooperative provides all of these things with profits, not by taxing income. Workers at Mondragon still get income taxes taken out of their paychecks, and cooperatives still pay corporate taxes, but at a much lower rate than traditional companies. And those tax dollars go to the Basque Country, itself an autonomous region that uses them (plus VAT taxes on goods and services) to fund things the corporation can’t: like infrastructure and elementary education. Mondragon’s democracy was, in many ways, a precursor to the ones that would eventually come to Spain. The organization was in business for 19 years by the time Franco died in 1975 and Spain started transitioning to a democracy. The Basque Country was established as an autonomous region in 1979 and they elected their first parliament in 1980. As the largest employer in the region, Mondragon is the Basque Country, and the Basque Country is Mondragon. “When they try to change the co-op law, they call us,” Lorenzo says. And when Mondragon wants to change cooperative law, they call the Basque Country. To this day, the two work reciprocally for the benefit of the region. Workers can now choose between Mondragon or Basque healthcare, and they have access to Spanish social security programs along with their Mondragon pensions. Lagun Aro fluctuates to fill in the gaps of government as needed, and the government fluctuates to supply the needs of the region. The Basque government also contributes a quota (called a “cupo”) to the Spanish government to fund defense, foreign affairs, and larger national projects that benefit the whole country. In this way, Mondragon acts as a self-governing city-state within a larger state and nation. Each individual cooperative has the most authority over workers’ lives, even as layers of Basque and Spanish governments provide larger, but more lightweight methods of governance for the greater whole. The structure works a lot like the one I outline in my essay: “Decouple federal government from nation-states.” “We work at three levels: With the Basque Government, with the Spanish Government, and with the European Government,” Lorenzo says. “Our aims are global, we want to create wealth, jobs, and develop a better strategy. Every government loves that idea.” If the model is a good one, detractors say it can’t be replicated outside of the Basque Country, and there’s some truth to that. Once employees are here they tend to be lifers, but getting them here has proved a real challenge. Lorenzo says they hire about 30% of their workforce from Mondragon University, but they need to hire more engineers than they can find in the Basque Country, and that means recruiting abroad. This is logistically challenging, but also culturally. “In the US, I have to buy a million-dollar house and $100,000 car, and have 80,000 products,” Lorenzo says. “The capitalist world is built on selfishness, individualism, being number one. We can’t attract the kind of hard talent that wants to make money and be number one.” Living expenses are much lower in the Basque Country than they are in the US, but so are salaries and that can be a tough sell. Dreams of becoming a billionaire are nonexistent. When I published an essay about employee ownership, one person commented: “Why the hell should anybody still start a company and want to become an entrepreneur when he needs to give stocks to every employee he hires? This is completely stupid. If you want to become rich, become an entrepreneur.” Mondragon is a different mindset. “We feel that our collective ‘us’ is more important than ‘me,’ but they are more independent, individualistic people,” Lorenzo says. “So it takes some time to really convince people that this system is worthwhile. They see sometimes that we are a compromise for a full life, so we have to think in new ways, adapt our system.” In Europe, cooperatives like Mondragon grew up alongside consumer co-ops like John Lewis & Partners in the UK. The Alta Deba region of the Basque Country isn’t so different from the Emilia Romagna region in Italy where cooperatives like SACMI and Manutencoop are highly networked with one another and cooperatives make up a third of the region’s GDP. In Brazil, Unimed recently became the largest worker cooperative in the world by revenue (Mondragon is second), providing an alternative to capital-based health systems. Five largest worker cooperatives in the world by 2021 revenue. Source While, in most of the world, capitalism grew up alongside the Rockefellers and the Carnegies of the world, cooperatives in Europe and South America were creating a much better form of it, but it’s a stark contrast. Try convincing the Jeff Bezos’ of the world to start a cooperative. Conversely, try convincing a Mondragon manager to keep the stock for themselves and become a Jeff Bezos. The two models come from two very different worlds. “I think it is possible to replicate, but it requires people who believe in the model and know how to replicate it,” Lorenzo says. “Before he opened the first co-op, [Arizmendiarrieta] had spent nearly 15 years preaching. He was educating, he was creating mindsets. It’s not a copy-and-paste issue, I don’t think it’s that easy.” If it’s education we need, Lorenzo admits Mondragon has fallen short. “We’ve been very good at doing, but not very good at telling these last 50 years. That’s why I’m sure your article will give us a good position.” Even as a journalist, information on the company has not been readily available. The books I read on the subject are only available at company headquarters. The biography of its founder is only in Spanish. Knowledge about the company is limited to educational materials, a sparse Wikipedia page, and a spattering of articles that extol the benefits of cooperatives without really explaining how they work. Members of the media are only granted access if they can attend one of the company’s in-person media days which are hosted once a month. I had to buy a plane ticket, rent a car, drive six hours from the Barcelona airport, and rent a hotel nearby to get a meeting—a large expense for an independent journalist. Subscribe It makes sense—cooperatives are businesses first and cooperatives second. They have to compete with other companies on the market, and win, to make a profit. Only then can they use that profit more equitably. “We bought the chairs in this room from a company that’s a cooperative,” Lorenzo illustrated, “but we got them because they were the best price and quality, not because they were from a cooperative.” Mondragon can’t afford to spend all their time proselytizing. What founders do come to study the model might put it into practice, but if they only create one cooperative that benefits 100 workers, Lorenzo says they miss the point. They need to create a network of them to fund new startups, create new jobs, provide social services, and transfer workers between companies. It is the combination of cooperatives that makes the whole thing self-sustaining, not the individual ones. There are very few of those. As of 2017, there were only 11.1 million worker-owners globally, out of 3.39 billion total workers—that’s only 0.33% of the working population, and it’s not growing.2 Employee ownership is rare, democratically-run cooperatives are rarer still, and a whole network of them? Mondragon and Unimed are really the only ones. Because of this, Lorenzo thinks we won’t create a world of cooperatives as the founders once imagined. “I think this is fiction because at the end of the day, there are forces in the world that are difficult to scale up.” If cooperatives are still a niche movement, the movement to make capitalism work better for more people is massive. As is well documented in Thomas Piketty’s work, inequality has been on the rise since the 1970s when wealth taxes were skewered and executives started getting paid in stocks. Those who owned capital (such as real estate, stocks, and bonds), got much richer, and because they got much richer, they bought more capital. Return on capital exceeds the rate of economic growth, meaning those with significant wealth saw their fortunes grow faster than the economy, the rest didn’t. A widening gulf now threatens to become much wider and the result is outrage. When the rich can afford mega-yachts and a well-paid software engineer can’t afford a house, we see a rise in the same “eat the rich” mentality that once cost Marie Antoinette her head. In the US, only 40% of those ages 18 to 29 view capitalism positively. Democrats think better of socialism than capitalism, 67% of young Brits do too. According to a Wiley’s worldwide survey, most countries are now anti-capitalist. Their top reasons why are all related to inequality. The most popular proposed solution is a wealth tax, but that could be enacted by one president only to be thrown out by the next one (or used to fund military endeavors rather than social ones). More extreme options involve eradicating capitalism altogether by returning to subsistence farming and bartering or giving the government control of the economy—we’ve tried both options and neither fared better for humanity than our current capitalist system. One option, however, has. Mondragon provides us with a successful, working model. It’s not throwing out capitalism, it’s creating a better form of it. It is still private individuals who own capital, but more of us become owners. Companies are still getting wealthy, but that wealth is put to better use. Rather than create a few rich people only to tax them on the back end, we allow everyone to get richer on the front end. We don’t get there through revolution, just evolution. Instead of descending into “late capitalism” we start building “mature capitalism.” We need to channel all of that anti-capitalist sentiment into a better capitalist solution, and we can start with what is already working. Most worker cooperatives are concentrated in Asia (8,573,775 worker-owners) and Europe (1,554,687 worker-owners) where cooperatives are a more widely accepted business model and offer an alternative democratic solution where there are less democratic governments—we should build more of those. Though there are significantly fewer in the Americas (982,285) and Africa (37,836), recent policy changes have incentivized employee ownership in the US, Canada, and the UK, as well as transferred ownership to 307,000 workers at 118 firms in South Africa—we should build more of those too. Around the world, we need founders to start new cooperatives and sell existing companies to employees—we need our governments to incentivize both options. It’s in their best interest to do so! If we can create more employee-owned companies, maybe we can slowly start edging out the shareholder-owned ones. If we can create a critical mass of them, maybe we can even start federating them together as Mondragon once did. If we can create more democratically-run companies, maybe then we won’t need our countries as much. With Mondragon-like clusters of profitable, democratically-run businesses, what we currently call government could be sufficiently stripped down to infrastructure and militaristic support. Anarchist, socialist, and capitalist thinkers alike have gotten behind this solution, with sci-fi authors imagining a world of cooperative city-states. “It’s funny that they use our ideas at all kinds of levels,” Lorenzo says. “Socialist, anarchist, capitalist—at the end our aims are very legitimate. We want to increase wealth, create jobs, and try to develop, in a way, a better world.” I still think we could get there—that we could create a world of cooperatives. It is at least one of our options. The future is long and capitalism is still new. It is still transforming into something better and evolving into what it will become. Humans are demanding a fix to inequality and companies like Mondragon are providing a successful blueprint we can follow. In a 2021 book about the founding of Mondragon, authors Armin Isasti and Isabel Uribe thought Arizmendiarrieta’s vision wasn’t yet done: “We need to imagine the future, consider alternatives, form new collectives, and be able to see beyond ourselves. We need to return to utopian thinking; we need people who have the courage to be utopians as José María Arizmendiarrieta was. Far from being satisfied with completing Arizmedi’s utopia, let us continue to yearn after a world in which imagination and hope are alive and active.” Arizmendiarrieta himself believed that vision was the first step. “Most of what has been achieved through conscious and responsible human effort has been, in first instance, a beautiful ideal,” he said. “And only that.” So long as we can imagine that beautiful ideal, maybe we can even create it.

You might be a “member” of your grocery store or outdoor retailer, for example, but the dividends you receive give you a discount on goods, not stock and profit sharing in the company. Worker cooperatives are a much smaller portion of the pie—on the World Cooperative Monitor’s list of the top 300 cooperatives by revenue, only five were worker cooperatives.

It's very cool, but I'm unsure how replicable the model really is. My conclusion is that it emerged out of the unique environment of already high Basque solidarity, but even more so under Franco's oppression. After a few generations, they admit that the hardcore spirit is gone and made initiatives to try to restore it, but still some of the biggest co-ops have died or been sold off (ie Fagor). My friends from there told me: \"It's where your dumb cousin works\", as it's very political with a lot of patronage kinds of networks that democratic elections at that scale tend to produce. They made a startup community there, but it seemed like most of the kids were trying to get out, not stay to reform the coop. I think the Italian Emilia Romagna region cooperatives [1] may be a less centralized model that could be better, as it does away with the big organization that eventually rots, like any big old org.

I'd like to see for myself firsthand what life would be like. Would it be boring? Would it be bureaucratic or unmeritocratic? Would that bother me personally? I don't speak Spanish, unfortunately. Obviously this article gives a rosy picture. However, the renewed interest in alternatives is precisely due to the new forms of arbitrary oppression that 21st century capitalism inflicts on many people, so maybe that would be one pathway for Mondragon and other meta-coops to flourish. Who knows. Moreover, it's not like actually-existing capitalism doesn't tend to produce its own forms of inequality. Maybe a sociologist or economist could show that the \"patronage networks\" in something like Mondragon are an effect of their structure but the overall negative outcomes are lessened/mitigated compared to the negative social outcomes of Western capitalism. A proper comparison would be an open research question. That's too bad about Fagor, 10 years ago I ordered a pressure cooker from them but had it returned immediately due to an improper lid fit. That would've been around the time of its decline and eventual closing off.

It seems like you're conflating sovereignty with economic dependence, which are two distinct concepts—being entirely economic independent seems highly geographically dependent. Few regions in the world are lucky enough to even have this option. For instance, you can be economically dependent on neighbors but still locally determine who runs the local courts.

But one cooperative person first needs to find someone else to cooperate with... and the other person also needs to have compatible skills and values... so it is often easier for the cooperative person to just give up, and work to make someone else rich. And the more difficult project you have, the more extreme this gets. If it is something that most people could do, it is easy for the cooperative people to find each other. It if it something that only one person in a thousand can do, the one-in-a-thousand cooperative person will have a huge problem finding the rest of the team. reply Dalewyn 18 hours agorootparentprevPut another way: Singers who aren't good enough to make it on their own form large idol groups (eg: AKB 48) to sell themselves, while those who are become stars on their own or form small bands with others of similar success.

For every really smart person, there is someone who lacks the cognition to participate meaningfully in society. For every brilliant individual, there is someone whose mental capacity puts them in need of lifelong care. The bell curve is a bitch. The average person just gets by and doesn’t think all that much about anything outside of their immediate surroundings. For most, politics and such is a team sport, not an intellectual pursuit. It’s an uncomfortable fact of life, and those that have talents and gifts above the norm are by default responsible for guiding and advancing society.

It does not explain why most of those who can do the difficult things end up working for someone else (rather than e.g. start a co-op). If stupidity was the entire answer, the smart bosses would be unable to find employees smart enough to work in their companies. Some businesses only require simple work, so you could argue that they have one smart boss and many stupid employees. But there are many businesses that require highly qualified professionals. And those professionals have mostly been taught that their proper place in life is working for someone else. This is practically what school trains you to do for decades -- there is the teacher who gives commands, and the students who obey. And then you transition to a job where it is the boss who gives commands, and the employees who obey.

In short, I have no idea what you’re on about. That said, I’m with you on labor movements, and believe that unions and coops are generally extremely positive things most of the time.

It’s worth mentioning that it is apparent to me that this inability is fostered in no small part by people and entities that make it their business to subvert otherwise good faith actors that don’t exercise very much independent thought into pursuing goals and supporting policies that are explicitly or covertly not in their collective best interest. Gullible people are gullible, and they are exploited all up and down the political spectrum. reply soulofmischief 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, we take a lot of things for granted. Intelligence is relative, and so we do find a normal distribution when defining IQ with a target median and mode of 100. However, we don't have to construct a society where thriving requires a median intelligence! That's a choice made by those who, as you say, benefit more from the system. It's not so simple to measure intelligence, anyway. I marvel at some of the things a below-average person does every day such as drive a car at high speeds on the interstate, or navigating political bureaucracy. Meanwhile, I'm two standard deviations above the mean but have ADHD and sometimes struggle with basic tasks that even people of below-average intelligence have mastered. The contrast is so much at times that I can see the confusion and concern in the faces of those around me whenever I have an ADHD moment. Yet, I'm an expert in multiple subjects, a quick learner and have a well-developed sense of intuition.

Thus it requires someone to be motivated by something other than money. Religion is one of the few things that will be able to inspire such amounts of work while forgoing most economic upside. Maybe nationalism can do that, but keep in mind that when this was combined with nationalism we got Nazism (Nazism took lots of inspiration from Austrian corporatism which was similarly influenced by Catholic social teaching here).

It might be a lack of education (not a value statement). Socialism in Spain was not established at once. It was an effort spanning many decades.

To the degree that Mondragon is democratic it is socialist. Socialism came to be commonly associated with \"State-capitalist monopoly\" (Lenin) later in the 20th century but that does not describe revolutionary Spain at all. There companies were mostly worker owned, democratically managed and freely associated within democratic regional and industrial cartels representing consumers' and producers' interests respectively. Highly advanced democratic systems. Larger companies were expropriated compulsory. Yes. But they were transferred into the ownership of the workforce.

I'm all for more cooperatives, it's a good model. Operating in a system which doesn't compel that form of organization is what keeps them honest. Mondragon is a profitable company, emphasis on profitable. The article talks a bit about how, while Mondragon is a pretty good deal for basic labor, they have trouble attracting high-demand talent like engineers, which they also need. In a free-market system, a worker's collective can solve a problem like that, by offering more perks, raising the 'level' for new engineering hires, waiving some amount of the up-front investment, or just getting by through, in effect, paying some of the salary in a nonmaterial reward of belonging to something which better meets some people's sense of ethics and fairness. That's not how it works when the company you work for is also the police and the military. It's also not how it works when every company is compelled to organize itself this way. That compulsion leads to dysfunction, corruption, cheating, and at the extreme end, gulags. So let's pass on all that.

Many socialist democrats (or democratic socialist, whatever your flavour) believe that collectivism need not be autocratic and all encompassing.

For instance corporations naturally minimize their labor costs according to the relative economic leverage of the participants often to the point of poverty vs those with little leverage whereas a cooperative would seem to be inclined towards decency at the cost of maximal profit. This difference in profit is invested back into the company in terms of capital investment and lower prices allowing more capitalist exploitive corporations to out compete and ultimately buy or destroy coops.

Except now this process can also be automated. Every artist who never studied the art of others, and invented their own style from scratch, has a right to complain, of course. reply abeppu 22 hours agoprevA thing that is kind of glossed over is: what is \"ownership\" when we talk about worker-owners at cooperatives? > The profits generated by each cooperative are put to work for the benefit of the greater whole. Each cooperative gives 14-40% of their gross profits to their division (depending on the division), and another 14% to their parent company. The rest are invested back in the cooperative (60% of net profits), distributed among their employees (30% of net profits), and donated to social organizations in their communities (10% of net profits). > Workers buy into their cooperative when they become employees, investing up to €16,000 into a personal equity account. They pay 30% of that investment upfront, with the remainder taken out of their paychecks over following 2 to 7 years. After two years with the organization, workers become “members” and start earning interest on their investment at a rate of at least 7.5% annually. If the cooperative does well, they might earn much more than that. Workers can pull this money out of their accounts when they leave the cooperative or retire. ... so it's not ownership, right? It's profit-sharing while you're an employee (the \"interest\" the worker gets is out of that 30% of net profits discussed previously), but you don't own shares in the company that you can then sell, like an employee who receives an RSU or receives and exercises an option. In some sense, corporate employees that get some form of equity as part of their compensation are more literally worker-owners. I think the problem with American companies that have an employee stock plan is that the employee stock pool is a small slice of the total ownership, and employees don't participate in any real democratic governance. Despite being shareholders, they get far less information about the financial health or strategic position of the company than investors with board seats. Real partial ownership doesn't lead to real power or access to information. And the aim of the company is still to serve the larger investors, not the workers. reply sgu999 22 hours agoparent> In some sense, corporate employees that get some form of equity as part of their compensation are more literally worker-owners. As soon as a worker leaves or sells their shares, these shares aren't worker-owned anymore and the interests of their owner can quickly diverge from the ones of a worker. That's roughly what a coop fixes I think. reply abeppu 22 hours agorootparentI can kinda see how one can argue that this is a feature rather than a bug, but I still think this points to the more distinctive feature in these coops being democratic governance of workers rather than ownership. I own shares of past companies I've worked at, but I don't have any representation in how the company is run. It doesn't matter if my interests have diverged from current workers, because I have no influence. If a company compensates its employees partially with RSUs, and those employees own and can eventually transfer those shares freely, and the company was also democratically governed by its workers ... could you not have \"real\" ownership (by current and past workers) and still protect current workers' democratic governance? reply drewmcarthur 21 hours agorootparent> democratic governance rather than ownership yes and no, i’d call the distinction collective ownership. you can sell your shares (by quitting), or you can stay and participate democratically. but you can’t do both, and that protects your say in the company, preventing investors from overruling worker-owners. > i have no influence neither do the current workers. the issue isn’t retail investors, but the ones with board seats. if boards only had one seat for an investor, that’d be one thing, but usually workers only get a single seat, if any. > protect current workers’ democratic governance you could do this with preferred shares, voting shares, etc. investor shares are non voting, voting shares can only be owned by workers, etc. you still have to counter their concentration though. reply abeppu 21 hours agorootparentI think we're roughly in agreement? Any organization that arranges for its workers to govern it has some organizing document that describes this structure. Any organization that arranges for its workers to become owners must pick mechanism for this to happen. My view is that these can be basically independent choices: - A firm can pursue a profit-sharing-for-current-workers approach as described for Mondragon, or can issue RSUs or options (\"real\" and transferable ownership) - And regardless of what \"ownership\" vehicle they pick, they can still be organized to be democratically governed by its workers (establishment of which need not be dependent on any stipulated \"ownership\"). I.e. your organizing docs can describe a board composed of current employees, elected by employees, etc. I am skeptical of the claim that profit-sharing while you're an employee is \"ownership\" in part because you are incentivized to prefer that the firm take profits while you work there. By comparison, if as a worker your vested stake persists even after you leave or retire, you might be much more inclined to vote for large reinvestments this year (and for the next several) which may not yield a profit until after you've left. Temporary \"ownership\" may not encourage the same long-term view as ordinary literal ownership. reply max_hoffmann 20 hours agorootparentCooperatives guarantee that only people working in the company benefit from the profit of their own work. If one can stop working and still take a share from the profits, everyone else would have to not just work for themselves and lose part of their profit to an increasing amount of people, who are not taking part in creating that profit. Cooperative guarantee that profit is owned by the people who create it. reply abeppu 18 hours agorootparentI think you may be too committed to dogmatic stances to constructively discuss other possibilities. I think this is no better when it's from the collectivist side than when it's from the capitalist fundamentalists. > Cooperative guarantee that profit is owned by the people who create it. I don't think all the value created by workers is realized as profit immediately. Workers can create value which only shows up in contributions to revenue much later. If you and your coworkers figured out the design and manufacturing process for a new product and the product only goes to market after you retired, you helped create the profits even if they arrive after you left the firm. If the coop structure as you narrowly define it doesn't allow workers to receive the profits of their labor in industries that have a long time to market or R&D cycle, then isn't that a recipe for those high value industries to be inaccessible to coops? Try to imagine an alternate history where Nvidia was a coop. A lot of the value behind its current high revenue was done many years ago. Cuda was released in 2007. I don't know how much of the hardware has inherited from older designs. If only current workers benefit from the current high sales, has the organization really ensured that \"profit is owned by the people who create it\"? That seems implausible. reply max_hoffmann 10 hours agorootparent> I don't think all the value created by workers is realized as profit immediately. And as the worker creating that future profit you are very well aware of that, plus everyone else working on the design and manufacturing is in the same situation as yourself. The good news is: all of you are also owners of the company. So together you can decide how an exit package should look like for people deciding to leave before the design reaches the market and generates profit. The same situation in a non-cooperative is a lot worse, because you have no stake in the company. The owner might be willing to negotiate an exit package before you even start working there, but they also might not. Plus before working at the company, you have no idea what the profit margins look like and what you might be working on. It’s the worst time for you to agree on an exit pacakge. Also during employment you are in a worse position, because the owner(s) can just let you go, if you are the only one asking for your fair share of future profits. You don’t have a say in the company. Most often they see your current salary as your share of the profit, no matter how much profit your design might create in the future. reply lishzen 17 hours agorootparentprevI understood from the article that workers remain working for the coop (possibly in different companies) until they retire, and then, the coop provides them with pensions; so they continue to receive value after retirement. reply chongli 12 hours agorootparentWhat if they pass away? I assume their shares are sold immediately and the money paid out to their estate. Now suppose that all the work they did was in the R&D phase (and fundamental to the project) but the final product had not been released at the time of death of the contributor — so the profits had not been realized — thus the payout on those shares would be a small fraction of their true valuation. Imagine if a novelist died just after submitting their final draft to their editor but prior to the book’s publication. Forcing the estate to sell off the book before it had a chance to hit the shelves — and become a bestseller — would be an outrage, yet the rigid nature of worker co-ops (cessation of work forces the sale of shares) guarantees this. reply max_hoffmann 10 hours agorootparentWhere’s the cooperative in your example? Either you are a freelance author who has a contract with a publishing cooperative. In this case you have a contract with that cooperative and during the negotation process both sides decide together what happens in case of death before publication. Or you are an author inside a publishing cooperative, so you own part of that cooperative and decide together with the other authors, publishers etc. what will happen, if somebody dies before the publication of their book. In both cases the author is part of the decision of what should happen in case of an early death. reply chongli 30 minutes agorootparentThe example way above was NVIDIA. Suppose the person who passed away was one of the founding researchers at the NVIDIA worker coop. They developed most of the key technologies that go into a graphics card, but they died during the later stages of production ramp up, before the first GPUs are able to hit the market. The issue is that the deceased researcher's contribution to the project may be so central and foundational that they may be entitled to a large plurality (or even majority) stake, but forcing the other worker-owners to buy out that stake to pay the estate would bankrupt the coop at this critical pre-production stage. Since only active workers are allowed to maintain ownership, allowing the estate to retain those shares and later receive dividends on future profits is off the table. This issue seems to tie everyone's hands and sound the death knell for the coop. The novelist case was meant to show an extreme non-coop situation. I don't see any compelling reason for writers of books to join coops, since the writing of the book is the only hard part these days (and countless ways to self-publish exist). reply tmnvix 20 hours agorootparentprev> ...these coops being democratic governance of workers rather than ownership.

Many corporate shareholders cannot freely sell; the idea of being able to sell stock for cash whenever you want to is unique to public companies. And yes, the real problem is information asymmetry. This is always the real problem. Arguably the secretary who knows everything that's going on with the company via watercooler talk has more power than the CEO whose underlings tell him only what he wants to hear.

The pensions people receive every month are literally paid by the taxes which are collected from everybody and every company during that month. Pensions are not saved money from companies you worked for, but money coming from the economy at the time of your retirement. It’s a common misconception that the state has a big pile of pension money sitting somewhere that you then get your pension from. That’s just not how it works in reality. Another difference from pensions to receiving money from a company just by owning parts of it, is also that you don’t continue to be on a company’s paycheck when you quit. You need to reach a certain age to receive money and you get that money from the state, not the companies you worked for.

The money you put in, is not the same money you get out of it. It’s still money that people working at that time, put into that fund. Nobody has their own personal savings account inside that fund. You only have a legal claim to a share of that fund once you retire, but that’s not the money from your paychecks and it’s not saved somewhere for you. A pension fund is not a collection of private pensions and it’s better that way. Because with inflation, your pension can increase, even though you didn’t \"put in\" that amount of money when you were still working. The government is able to increase pensions by shifting money from other parts of its balance sheet or by increasing debts or taxes to meet the pension demand. I’m sorry for Singapore if their state system works more like a private pension, because you don’t know how long you’ll live past retirement age, so you either take too much or too little out of that fund once you have retired and there is no adjustment for inflation.

If we oversimplify a human's needs into clothing, food, and a dwelling, and ignore the concept of money, the industrial revolution has made it so that humanity is able to produce enough of those for everybody. It then becomes a distribution and coordination problem rather than a problem of there not being enough for everybody. Of course, if we abolished money there would be other problems, so it's still delusional, but if 100 people can make enough food and shelter and clothing for 1000 people using machines, why do the other 900 need to sit in an an office making spreadsheets five days a week?

At this point it favors the common ownership forms of business. Starting a coop is hence much harder than it should be. This is what i think where the \"it's a shame\" make most sense.

This was recognized by everyone from Karl Marx to Abraham Lincoln to Adam Smith. Smith even conceded that profit was impossible if workers retain their surplus value, which is exactly the point. I bring this up because that's what capitalism is: draining the surplus labor value from workers to the capital-owning class. In feudalism, the artistocracy and th emonarchy extracted that value. Jeff Bezos is the new king. Why do I mention this? Because it wasn't that long ago that this view was universally accepted. The Red Scare post-WW2 spread a lot of damaging propaganda that has led ordinary people to fight for the ultra-rich to have even more money, to their own detriment. Walmart killing all your local businesses then leaving, leaving you in a food desert with a Family Dollar store maybe. That's capitalism. Locally-owned businesses. That's socialism. Monsanto agribusiness? Capitalism. Family-owned farms? Socialism. Something like Mondragon shows that large-scale cooperatives can work. And the reason why these sorts of things aren't more prevalent is that laws are passed to make them difficult to set up or outright illegal. Many US states outlaw municipal broadband, for example. And any country in the last 70 years that even thinks about nationalizing resource extraction finds itself having a coup that nearly always has the CIA's fingerprints over it. Or we simply starve them to death under the sanitized euphemism of \"economic sanctions\" (eg Cuba, Iraq, Venezuela). I really want people to understand that we're not doing this for any moral reason. We're doing it at the behest of Western companies who would prefer to steal the riches of these countries.

The government does not bail out every business that fails. That's ludicrous. Investors like VCs can and do lose their investments all the time with no government intervention whatsoever. An owner is also risking in terms of opportunity cost - time lost to starting a business and failing is inherently riskier than working with similar talents and investing in safer assets like index funds for the potential upside of higher returns if the business succeeds.

I think it is disingenuous to think \"basic needs\" is simple to define, considering that there is no cheap and free energy source (and other resources). For someone living in a warm climate, the basic need for heating in north of Europe will look like a waste. My opinion is that tax systems are completely outdated and they should use more \"asymptotic/exponential/complex formulas\".

That's socialism. There is definitely nothing in the definition of socialism that says everything is locally-owned. Moreover, that can be a way to end up with things like Redlining and other institutional racial issues. >>>There is no value without labor. The great thing Marx did was show that everything could be converted to a value measured by labor. But, economists afterwards showed that once you have that conversion, you can do it literally with anything. We could have a system based on the number of bumblebees required to build a house. That is a normative judgement that labor is somehow special. Now, our current implementation of Capitalism is clearly wreaking havoc on our environment. But it has brought the standard of living up across the entire world past a Malthusian cycle of more food means more people, means they eat the food, and we have starvation. The same can be said for current implementations of Communism all across the globe. Lastly, cooperatives may be a great solution for a lot of manufacturing and housing challenges. And when you get to the scale of a country, a co-op is just a government, and a capitalistic democracy feels a lot more like a co-op than a dictatorship or authoritarianism even with all its pitfalls. A populous who then really starts to demand through votes that we change to improve the blight of our fellow humans seems an even better place to live, if we can just get there. reply WalterBright 17 hours agorootparent> our current implementation of Capitalism is clearly wreaking havoc on our environment Communist countries are the most polluted ones. reply kylestlb 15 hours agorootparent\"communist\" countries are simply countries that are still operating within Global Capitalism that happen to be run by parties that are made up of communists. They would also freely admit that. There are no communist countries because communism isn't here yet. reply WalterBright 14 hours agorootparentI know. Every failure of communism is because it wasn't really communist! I wonder where the tipping point of \"true\" communism is? Because the closer one gets to communism, the worse the results. Free markets, on the other hand, work even if they aren't perfect. The more free they are, the better they work. reply Apocryphon 49 minutes agorootparentOn the other hand, countries with more regulated markets such as European nations, the U.K. and Commonwealth nations, and Japan and some of the East Asian Tigers might have less pollution than the United States. You get Americans importing EU baby formula because they are more restrictive about what chemical additives can go into them. Couldn't it just be argued that free market extremism is as much folly as a pro-central planning position? reply eightysixfour 22 hours agorootparentprev>>> Locally-owned businesses.

It's to display the hypocrisy of those in power who declare things in their favor as beneficial and those that are not beneficial as harmful and bad.

It's an oversimplification to highlight the main point: workers' relationship to the means of production. In capitalism, capital owners own the means of production.

IME most Americans not only don't know what socialism is (despite being opposed to it), they don't know what capitalism is either (despite supporting it). > Now, our current implementation of Capitalism is clearly wreaking havoc on our environment.

    "originBody": "Interviewing Epic Games Founder/CEO Tim Sweeney and Author/Entrepreneur Neal Stephenson MetaverseInterviews Jul 16, 2024 Written By Matthew Ball On June 25th, I interviewed Tim Sweeney, Founder and CEO of Epic Games, which makes the Unreal Engine and Fortnite, and Neal Stephenson, the #1 New York Times bestselling author who also coined the term “Metaverse” in his 1992 bestseller Snow Crash, and is a Co-Founder of blockchain start-up Lamina1, and AI storytelling platform Whenere. In the interview, we discuss their definitions of “Metaverse,” thoughts on its technological and economic growth, Neal’s reaction on the day Facebook changed its name to Meta, the future of Fortnite, Apple’s Vision Pro, blockchains, and the ethics of Generative AI, plus “Snow Crash 2,\" and much more. My new book “The Metaverse: Building the Spatial Internet,” is now out (Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble, Bookshop), and is a 70% net new update to the 2022 edition, which was personally blurbed by Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Sweeney, Reed Hastings, and more, became a national bestseller in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and China, and was named a Book of the Year by The Guardian, Amazon, The Economist’s Global Business Review, and other publications. More details at www.ballmetaversebook.com/. Ball: Let's start at the foundation. Neal, how do you define the Metaverse in 2024? Stephenson: A massively multiplayer online universe that has a sense of space to it so that there are experiences distributed around that space in a way that is perceived by all of its users in the same way. And you can move around from one place to another and interact with other users who are not physically present. It’s not controlled by any one entity; many creators, large and small, build things there. Ball: How about you, Tim? What comes to mind when you think of the word Metaverse? Sweeney: Well, Neal invented the word, and so I would defer to him on that. But I will just observe that we've seen games trending in the direction of that definition for a very long time and becoming more and more close to not only Neal's definition, but kind of the spirit of what Neal wrote in Snow Crash and other novels. And this is what makes it timely and interesting to Epic. Ball: For many people, the word Metaverse brings to mind (if not outright requires) virtual reality goggles and augmented reality glasses. From your perspective and the Epic perspective, how central, critical, or relevant overall are goggles or glasses to the vision of the Metaverse? Sweeney: Well, I think this is happening now and you don't need new hardware to experience it. Hardware getting better over time and more powerful will enhance it for sure. I think what we're seeing emerge now is to some extent, inevitable, right? As soon as people invented microelectronics, a few years later people started making video games out of parts. And as computers and consoles took off, games grew in their capabilities and then the internet came along and gaming became multiplayer. I think what we're really seeing is the inevitable evolution of gaming to take advantage of all the new capabilities that people are learning of and discovering every year. And when we talk about the Metaverse, it's a word that kind of has a stock price. When we release something cool, it goes up and when we release something that's not cool, it goes down, but it's very much not any one company defining this. Rather we're all building towards this ideal that we and all of the players in the world are talking about and debating and discussing, and we're figuring out what it is as we go and figuring out the nuances of what makes it work and what makes it really awesome and fun. Ball: Neal you've spoken about your changing perspective on the criticality of head-mounted displays relating to the Metaverse. What's your perspective in 2024? Stephenson: My overarching answer is that the actual market and actual users find ways to do things that we don't necessarily imagine in advance, just with our own limited perspective. And so cyberpunk had a whole aesthetic about it and still does, which to a large extent, revolved around having cool shit on your face. Mirror shades. Actually, one of the original anthologies of cyberpunk fiction was called Mirror Shades. And it was easy to assume back then that in order to truly experience a three-dimensional environment in an immersive way that you needed stereoscopy, you needed to have a different image slightly in each eyeball to give you a fully three-dimensional effect. And so there's always been this linkage in people's minds between cyberspace, the Metaverse, and goggles. What we've learned is way more nuanced and interesting than that. The year after Snow Crash came out was when Doom was released, and Doom is the ancestor of all games that are set in immersive environments [Note: Tim is nodding]. And it didn't require stereoscopy. It was all in a screen - very low resolution by current standards - and yet, the magic of the illusion was that you were running around in this three-dimensional persistent environment. And then since then, that kind of experience has only gotten better. And in the meantime, we've been learning things about goggles, about headsets and what they are and are not good at. And it took a long time for them to get to the point where [input/output] lag was acceptable. And so there's kind of this long period of time during which video games on screens were getting much, much, much better, but the acceptance of headsets was [falling] behind, because if lag is bad, you're more prone to get sick. One of the things that I became aware of when I was working at Magic Leap on AR headsets is that stereoscopy isn't enough. That your brain actually uses a lot of other cues other than stereoscopy to build a map of the three-dimensional world around you. And so people with one eye, one-eyed people can still perceive three-dimensionality, for example, because of these other mechanisms. This is a kind of a long-winded way of saying that the reality we've ended up with, which didn't seem plausible in 1990 when I was writing [Snow Crash], is that we've got billions of people fluently navigating highly realistic, immersive, three-dimensional worlds using flat screens and keyboard and mouse. Ball: So I want to use this to jump into a related question. Since Meta's name change in 2021, there have been a number of different eulogies for the Metaverse. And so I have to ask the question starting with you, Tim, what's your perspective on the suggestion that the Metaverse is dead, duly rejected by consumers, and long since buried? Sweeney: Well, I think what's been rejected is a particular vision of the Metaverse, which is people putting on VR headsets and going to the office and working with co-workers in this Silicon Valley chic art style, that was just totally lame and was never going to succeed. But on the other hand, if you look at what people are doing with their time in video games. Fortnite and Roblox and other immersive games like PUBG Mobile are growing at an amazing rate. People are playing them, enjoying them. You can identify now about 800 million people who engage in these kinds of experiences every month. And what they're doing is very Metaverse. They're going into a real-time, 3D environment with their friends. They're engaging in a variety of different experiences. In Fortnite alone, the time is [mostly in] Battle Royale, but there are other user created things too, and other Epic created things which are consuming more and more of a fraction of people's time, and they really are traveling through virtual worlds together socially and having fun together. And it is becoming, in many ways, a new medium that is qualitatively different than the multiplayer games of the older eras like Doom or Ultima Online. What's happening now is different. Being there in 3D emoting and voice chat is, to me, that's the version of the Metaverse that's actually working. And when a company does something lame and people say \"The Metaverse.... it's failed.\" No, a developer, perhaps us sometimes, just did something that was lame and that particular thing failed. But the idea goes on. And I think overall, it's inevitable that gaming becomes more and more like this, more socially connected, more interconnected with many creators participating and what you're experiencing, and a faster number of people participating so that the internet itself or the social networks, it eventually becomes ubiquitous and everybody's there. So I think in terms of actual use and actual engagement, [the Metaverse] is going stronger than ever before, definitely stronger than last year and stronger than the year before that. And it's on the growth. But when companies try lame stuff, it's rejected however strong the reputation of the company is. Ball: So Tim's talking about lame stuff often being publicly associated with the Metaverse. Neal, I think another common association with this dystopia. That the concept of the Metaverse is inherently dystopic, or if it's not, the book that it comes from is considered dystopic. You're responsible for both. What's your perspective? Is it an inherently dystopic concept? Is that what you were trying to communicate in the book? Stephenson: By the time I wrote Snow Crash, the dystopian elements of cyberpunk had already become so familiar and kind of shopworn that it was already a little bit of a cliche, so I didn't feel as though I could just write another one of those with a straight face. So Snow Crash is both a dystopian novel in some ways and a parody of the tropes of dystopian novels [Note: Tim is nodding]. It tries to be funny, which was a thing that alarmed and disconcerted some readers at the time; they didn't know what to make of that. We could get into a whole question of whether basically stable civilization of people living mostly in comfortable burbclaves is more or less dystopian than a post apocalyptic wasteland or something like that. But I'll concede the point that that world [of Snow Crash] has got dystopian stuff in it. The Metaverse as shown in the book, is really neither dystopian nor utopian. It's just a communications medium that different people use in different ways. When we first see it, we're seeing kind of the schlockiest, most mass market version of it with intrusive advertisements and kind of garish lowest common denominator content. But as we get into the book, we see people using it in much more interesting ways. We see characters who've gone to a great deal of effort to build exquisite environments that they enjoy being in. We see the kind of library environment where the librarian is curating a huge storehouse of ancient information. And so I think it's possible for all of those things to be true at once, and that already we can see examples of all of those different styles of usage in the Metaverse as it's coming into existence today. Ball: So October 28th, 2021, Facebook announces it's changing its name to Meta. What did you think Neal? What was your instant response that day and a month later? Stephenson: Well, I was working and I have a hobby of machining, so I was working in a machine shop on something and my phone buzzed, and it was a text message from John Gaeta, who I worked with at Magic Leap [Note: Gaeta is also a visual effects designer and inventor, and partly credited with creating Bullet Time, which won him an Oscar]. And he just sent me a text message saying, \"I'm sorry for your loss.\" And so, I had no idea what he was talking about, and I thought, oh, some friend of his must have experienced a death in the family and he's trying to send condolences to this person but he hit the wrong button and he sent it to the wrong guy. And so I better tell John that his message didn't reach the intended recipient. So I'm sort of thumbing that out, and knowing John with a little bit of a mischievous streak, maybe I better do some Googling and catch up on current events. So that was when I became aware of the name change and understood the true meaning of John's message. And then within 48 hours, other huge companies like Microsoft, and I think Google had also come out and said, \"Oh, yeah, yeah, we are Metaverse companies too,\" because I think they wanted to prevent a competitor from establishing a lock on that name. And then a million smaller companies came in the wake of that saying, \"Oh, well, if the next big thing is the Metaverse thing, we are now Metaverse companies.\" A year and a half later, they'd be calling themselves AI companies. So I just tried to take it with a little bit of a sense of humor, and as time went on, I looked for ways to see if I could create anything sustainable out of that whole scene. So that's how I ended up, for example, talking to Marc Petit [then VP and GM of Unreal Engine at Epic Games] and Patrick Cozzi [CEO/Founder of Cesium], who had been working on the idea of a decentralized open Metaverse, and I continue to be in touch with them, and have co-founded Lamina1, which is a company dedicated to building infrastructure for a decentralized open Metaverse, and building a thing called Whenere, which is the place that I would want to visit in the Metaverse. So I just think that's the best way to deal with all that is to try to make use of the notoriety while it lasted to create some things that were sustainable. I knew that a year later there would be another fad that would knock Metaverse off the stage and become the new hot thing in tech. Ball: Neal, do you ever consider doing a sequel to Snow Crash? You've done sequels to a few of your books, some have been planned as multi-part entries. Is there a Snow Crash 2 that ever seeps into your mind? Stephenson: Actually, over the last couple of years I've produced a bunch of material that I call the Extended Snow Crash Universe timeline, which places the events of Snow Crash into a specific date on the calendar, and then there's sequel and prequel material connected with that. And some of it's filling in backstory. There's this character named Lagos in the book who's an interesting guy, but we don't quite ever hear how he got involved in all this. So I've got his backstory all worked out in detail. And I also created another place in the Metaverse called Vertex4 which is more more geared towards interactive. The Black Sun and everything you read about in the book is very much, it's suitable for use in a work of written fiction. It's not actually that transferable to an interactive experience. So yeah, there's not a sequel in the sense of a written book, but there's sequel and prequel material that may break the surface in various formats as we go along. Ball: Tim, in the past you've pointed to code from the very first Unreal Tournament in 1997, making the argument that you and the company have had Metaverse ambitions for quite some time. And I know that you've been speaking about the Metaverse for at least 15 years publicly, long before the hype. I'd love to understand why do you want to build the Metaverse? Is that Epic's overarching ambition or is that just one of many goals? Sweeney: I think this is the inevitable future of real-time 3D in gaming. It became apparent in the very early days of computers for me. We used to dial into bulletin boards with modems before we had the open internet and played a multi-user dungeon game and a text mode game where you joined a Unix server that was serving a dozen people at a time and you'd type commands and go from place to place. But you realized there are other people in this world and you could go up, you can have conversations with them in the world, but you could also engage in gameplay. And that was around 1985 or so. It became apparent at that point that this was going to be the future of gaming, and that as computers became more capable and connectivity improved and graphics capabilities grew, we'd get multiplayer games where the social element would be by far the most compelling games. And it's taken a very long time to get to that point. From October 1997: pic.twitter.com/T1cYLHjPP9 — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) June 14, 2021 We've had metaverse aspirations for a very, very long time. It started with text chat in realtime 3D with 300-polygon strangers. But only in recent years have a critical mass of working pieces started coming together rapidly. — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) June 14, 2021 From then to the first Unreal game being released was 12 years. But subsequent capabilities have taken a very long time. Ubiquitous internet connectivity of the form that can support a real-time 3D simulation at quality is a problem that took decades to solve. Being able to draw a world as realistic as the Fortnite Battle Royale world with 100 players participating in a simulation together took decades. There was an entire genre of games in Battle Royale that you couldn't have built a decade earlier. The technology just wasn't capable and the computers were just not fast enough. And so a large part of this has been building up our part of civilization's technology tree, building up all of the real-time 3D features and building up all of the simulation features that are needed to run these sorts of universes. And seeing at the same time, people's expectations of the world are changing. We had the internet long before we had social networks. We had social networks long before people began joining these games and hanging out with their friends in real time 3D and voice chatting as we do now. And as each new tier of capabilities came online, we've been getting closer and closer. And I think we can finally see in Fortnite and Roblox and a few other experiences, all of the elements of the Metaverse in place, but in a very early and limited form. You see a creator tool set that's increasingly powerful like the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) where people can build their own content. Over the next few years it’s going to approach the levels of AAA game development capabilities. You have very realistic 3D graphics capabilities. You have the ability to take content that's been built for movies, take blueprints and schematics of cars that have been built for production and then bring them into real time 3D and have them work as functioning objects. And so the convergence of all these different 3D content pipelines from different industries into real time 3D, into Fortnite, as we've done with so many of our crossovers, is really starting to show that there's not just a bunch of games out there. There is an entire universe in which all of the world's cool ideas and brands and creators connect together into a single space and can build anything far beyond previously envisioned limits. It is going to evolve at a far faster pace than any one company could ever build anything, because there's going to be hundreds of thousands of creators each contributing their art and their code and their ideas to it, and all the world's major brands contributing their IP and their ideas and their support to it. And it's going to take on a life of its own and really quickly transcend what it is today. It's become very clear over the past few years that we're in this steep growth curve that's being driven by that. Though there are some structural impediments in the way, for example Apple blocking Fortnite and blocking different development practices that are going to be absolutely necessary to create the Metaverse, the legal and technical problems are being addressed. This medium is emerging at an astonishing rate, and I think people have no idea how awesome it's going to be by the end of this decade. But when you look at all the best capabilities of the top game engines, look at all the work being created for top movies in the film industry, all the work of all the car makers and of all the other storytellers and creators of all different kinds of games, and envision what the world is like when all of that comes together into a socially connected united economy which everybody can participate in, that's going to be a whole new world. And that's what we're very excited about. But nobody had any clear vision of this in the 1980s, but it was obvious at that point in 1985, that the world was heading in this general direction. And for the past 33 years of Epic's history, we've been marching in this direction, figuring out exactly what the direction is as we go, but we are learning every step of the way and getting closer and closer. Stephenson: For people who never saw a MUD [Multi-User Dungeon], to roll the clock back a few decades, the thing about that that was mind-blowing at the time was that it's the simplest possible ASCII teletype interface, but when you were moving around that dungeon and you were in a particular location in the dungeon, if there was another player in the same location, then the system knew that, and there might be some form of interaction that could happen at that point. And as simple as it was, that was the thing that just completely blew everybody's mind. It's really the basis for anything that's happened since then in a metaverse-y kind of development path. Now Available: “THE METAVERSE AND BUILDING THE SPATIAL INTERNET,” the fully revised and updated edition of my nationally bestselling (US, UK, Canada, China) and award-winning book (Best of 2022 by Amazon, The Guardian, FT China, The Economist’s Global Business Review, Barnes & Noble). Buy at Amazon, Apple, B&N, more. Ball: So when I was writing this book, I was reading a bunch of Richard Bartle's old published works, and he had reported on a statistic that I thought was remarkable, which was as late as 1993, a full 10% of all global internet traffic was just for MUDs. Sweeney: That was to the point where you realized that the graphics can help the experience, but they're not essential. Our brains are willing to fill in massive amounts of detail. In my memory of reading Snow Crash, I actually see images of it though it was just a book. From the early MUDs to playing Doom with 320 by 200 pixels of real estate on the screen, my memories of are in fully formed photorealistic fashion. And I think that's the big lesson that we don't need hardware that plugs into our brain and creates a sense of immersion that's indistinguishable from reality. What we can do with just the devices right in front of us is totally not the limiting factor now. Ball: Neal, I'd love to get a little bit deeper into Lamina1. You co-founded it in 2022 with one of your colleagues from Magic Leap, Rebecca Barkin. Can you explain what Lamina1 is, how it works, what it's trying to do, and its criticality to the Metaverse as you imagine it? Stephenson: If we're going to have a Metaverse that millions of people use, we need to have experiences there that people enjoy having, which seemed like kind of a obvious statement to make, especially in present company. But the people who know how to make those experiences are the creators who by and large are employed in the video game industry or more and more in the motion picture and TV industry. They're the people who know how to run game engines and who know how to run the tool chains that feed assets into those engines. So the question is, what's the revenue model that allows those people to get paid? And there's various answers to that question. We have conventional payment systems that work, but in our minds, there was an overlap there with some of the qualities and capabilities of blockchain systems. And so Lamina1s a new chain that's optimized to help creators build things, to help them get paid for building things and creating experiences or components of new experiences in an open Metaverse. Ball: Crypto has become one of those more controversial elements among Metaverse aficionados. There are those who are ardent believer's in blockchain technology's criticality to the Metaverse. You have those who are entirely skeptical about the technology, not just unconvinced of its relevance. And then comparatively few people in the middle who largely say, \"not sure; we'll see.\" What in your mind makes blockchain such a viable, helpful, if not essential technology for building an open Metaverse? Stephenson: I think a lot of the skepticism and hostility that we've seen, particularly in the game development industry, just comes from this clash of mindsets between people who are strongly ideologically motivated coming out of a libertarian crypto kind of mentality, versus the people who build these experiences and who actually understand how game engines work. And there's a dream of interoperability, which is the idea that you could essentially drag and drop assets from one game into another, which is quite reasonably seen as threatening and even kind of insulting to people who spend their lives crafting beautiful AAA games. And it's also technically ridiculous. If you actually understand how these things work, you can't just take an asset from one game and somehow drop it into another. So I think that it is possible to engineer new experiences from the ground up that are designed to support interoperability and that there's some overlap between what that is going to look like and the kinds of payment systems that you can construct, and the more importantly, the smart contract systems that you can construct on top of blockchains. For me, money is kind of the least interesting of applications on blockchains. It's the one that's gotten the most attention because they were mostly started as financial instruments. But with the rise of NFTs, we saw this idea that you could essentially put pieces of art up on a chain. And what was then discovered was that the smart contracts that governed these NFTs weren't smart, and they weren't contracts. They actually weren't enforceable. And so some work has been going on in the last couple of years to bring the NFT market into the realm of legal enforceability. The late Josh Kramer at Grapevine developed some technology in this area, but unfortunately passed away last fall. Mattereum is a company in the UK that's building royalty systems based on legitimate UK law. And our friends at Shrapnel have been developing an actual running AAA game that embodies some of the features I'm talking about, where creators can post things on a chain that establish a kind of chain of IP development, IP ownership that's traceable, and that should in theory, allow them to get rewarded economically if their stuff succeeds. So that's I guess kind of the quick overview of a really complicated topic. Ball: Tim, I'm curious about your perspective on blockchain technologies. Sweeney: The underlying idea of blockchains is awesome nerd technology. There's great use of cryptography, great protocols for distributed agreement on events, and a really interesting foundation for the future of distributed computing systems of all sorts, including the Metaverse. It strikes me as very unfortunate that it didn't have another couple decades to be nurtured in the purely nerd community before it was adopted as a financial instrument, because the currency has been greatly undermined by speculation and scams and regulatory uncertainty and so on. And I feel like it's a very unfortunate artifact of this decade. But in the future, the ideas from various blockchains such as zero knowledge proofs, the idea of cryptographic consensus protocols and so on, should be a key component of a lot of systems. And if we would only stop clawing the money and stop building financial scams around them, then they could be a great part of a future society. I think that it takes a lot of discipline in the minds of technologists to separate the good from the bad of crypto. There is actually a great deal of good in the technology, separate from the bad uses of it that we've seen over the past, and I think we should be open-minded to the learnings to be made from there. Perhaps in a decade or two, we'll look back and be like comparing the cryptocurrency period we went through now to the 1990s dot-com crash. Underneath all of that, the internet was really solid technology and there were some companies built up in that timeframe, like Amazon actually did extremely well and thrived, but there are also scams layered on top of it. But the world recovered from that and is doing great now. And I think the world will end up on the right side of blockchain technology in the long-term future. And in the meantime, it's still a rather wild west so buyer beware. I think the future of the Metaverse has to be built on open protocols, open standards and interoperability of all forms. We need both technological interoperability so that any creator, any hosting provider, any ecosystem operator, any brand and any content can interoperate freely without being forced into any one company's walled garden of any sorts. And this isn't really even an attempt to paint a utopian picture, but just that there are going to be lots of places in the Metaverse and a lot of these places will be owned by companies, but we mustn't allow any one company to dominate or control the thing overall. And this both goes for the underlying technology and standards, but also for commerce and notions of ownership and economic interoperability in the Metaverse. When we designed the Fortnite Creator Economy 2.0, the key principle is realizing there are two things happening in the Fortnite economy. There is value being created through engagement, people building fun experiences. Third-party creators as well as their own teams are creating value engaging players. And because players are engaging and are happy, they're spending money in the Item Shop. And so the key became to share the Item Shop’s revenue, which is a source of spending, with experiences, which are the source of engagement, and build an economy that scales based on that. And from the very beginning, the idea was that we're operating a Fortnite version of this initially, but in the long run, there's no reason that this Creator Economy 2.0 couldn't be extended into a Creator Economy 3.0 where any company could participate however they choose. And besides participating in technical standards, if another ecosystem with similar or compatible visual aesthetic and respect for games ratings and so on wanted to participate, then perhaps we could connect our economies where if you spend in the Fortnite Item Shop and then play in a third-party economy, then we revenue share to them. And if a third-party item shop sells something and then it's used in Fortnite, they revenue share to us. And just as internet hosts agree on peering arrangements to connect their fiber optic lines, that revenue sharing can enable an open Metaverse economic model. And I think this is one of the exciting things that we'll see happen within this decade. And Epic has been on a very long-term trajectory to build out all of this tech and to do it in a thoroughly open way. We have Unreal Engine, which is a huge engine, but we expect the ultimate Metaverse technical standards will be engine agnostic and that you could participate in the open Metaverse in the game that's built using the Unity engine or the Godot permissively licensed open source engine. And while you're doing that, you could use any number of online backends. You could use the Epic Online Services social backend for voice chat or you could use Sony's PSN or Microsoft's Xbox Live or Valve's with Steamworks. And that perhaps if these companies would actually cooperate in the right ways, then we could build an entire economy that links all the major games and all of the platforms together into an economy. I think it's actually in everybody's best interest. This isn't like the smartphone walled gardens. What's happening in the Metaverse is Metcalfe’s Law at a huge scale. Players want to be in a place where they can play with their friends. If we can connect our voice chat systems and our economies and players can move seamlessly together with their party and with their purchases where they're compatible, move from say, Fortnite to Roblox to Grand Theft Auto to PUBG Mobile, and then to a pure chat type of application as well, then the world would be a better place. But not only that, but the companies participating would actually make more money because we'd see an engagement lift from the ability to reach more customers through this interconnected economy. And all of our competitors would gain more revenue too because of the increased opportunity they have to actually reach customers and players would play more and they would spend more, because buying an outfit in this future open Metaverse could be owning it everywhere they went and not just in the one Roblox experience or one Fortnite ecosystem that they're participating in as is currently the case. I really think that this is going to happen. And it doesn't rely on any altruism for those participants, but it's in everybody's interest and that this world of the open Metaverse will just be purely better than the separate game worlds that we have today. Stephenson: You don't want to have to stop at the exit of every Metaverse experience and take all your clothes off and then step across the threshold into a different experience and then put on the clothes that you're allowed to wear in that experience. You want to just walk through. And that seems so obvious that people just assume that's the case. It seems like you shouldn't even have to mention that, but it takes a lot of technology to actually make that work. Ball: The seventh anniversary of Fortnite comes up next month. Seven years from now, how do you think of Fortnite as being different? I think in the typical fan's perspective, Fortnite right now is Battle Royale, which they see primarily as a game. They see the Metaverse play primarily around UEFN. And the interaction model for UEFN feels a little bit like an app store or Netflix or YouTube. You've got thumbnails and rows and rows of them, and that's how you navigate these different 3D worlds that are lightly connected through avatars and aesthetics and user identities. What do you think the platform looks like another seven years from now? What's your dream experience? Sweeney: It's going to evolve a lot. And when you look at what's in Fortnite today, some of it you have to recognize as artifacts of the limitations of the current technology that we're working within. Why is Fortnite: Battle Royale 100 players? Well, because at the time we launched it we couldn't make 200 players work on a server. Computers in the data center were just too slow. The reason we have Fortnite divided into a huge number of different islands, many built by third-party creators and some built by Epic, is because we don't yet have the entire technology stack needed to robustly enable every creator to put their content together into a big, seamless open world if they wanted. And so a lot of the things you see in there are not the permanent end state of what we see this medium being, but are just current crutches that we're using to hobble by as we work towards the ultimate capabilities of the thing. And so I think we need to expect really significant changes in a number of areas. One is being able to build an interoperable economy that works with other games and other ecosystems is a key that will be really freeing for people, being all of the systems for voice chat and account interoperable, federated so that you can participate with any of the major platform company services rather than each Fortnite using ours and every other game using their own is going to be a key part of it. Another is the networking model, which is extremely limited. If you look at what's in Unreal Engine 5 today, it's remarkably similar to the networking model I built for Unreal Engine 1 in 1997. It shipped in Unreal and Unreal Tournament, and it's been incrementally improved ever since without dramatically upending it. But the problem with this network model is it doesn't enable our servers to talk to each other. A Fortnite Battle Royale session is 100 players. There might be at peak hundreds of thousands of these servers running and there might be at peak over 10 million concurrent players online all at once, but they're each in their own separate sharded copies of the world and they can't see each other in that space. They can't go anywhere to find each other all at once. So one of the big efforts that we're making for Unreal Engine 6 is improving the networking model, where we both have servers supporting lots of players, but also the ability to seamlessly move players between servers and to enable all the servers in a data center or in multiple data centers, to talk to each other and coordinate a simulation of the scale of millions or in the future, perhaps even a billion concurrent players. That's got to be one of the goals of the technology. Otherwise, many genres of games just can never exist because the technology isn't there to support them. And further, we've seen massively multiplayer online games that have built parts of this kind of server technology. They've done it by imposing enormous costs on every programmer who writes code for the system. As a programmer you would write your code twice, one version for doing the thing locally when the player's on your server and another for negotiating across the network when the player's on another server. Every interaction in the game devolves into this complicated networking protocol every programmer has to make work. And when they have any bugs, you see item duplication bugs and cheating and all kinds of exploits. Our aim is to build a networking model that retains the really simple Verse programming model that we have in Fortnite today using technology that was made practical in the early 2000's by Simon Marlow, Simon Peyton Jones and others called Software Transactional Memory. The idea is that you write normal code and it's our job as the implementors of the engine and the language runtime to make your code scale, so the game can run on a vast number of servers and to do all of the necessary coordination and to provide the guidelines. If you optimize your code in a certain way like you optimize for cache coherency today, then we want your game to be able to run in a much larger simulation than we're running now. This is one of our focuses for Unreal Engine 6, and it's going to consume an increasing portion of our engine team's efforts as we work on this. And the other is the ability to combine as much of the content together into a seamless world as players want. Some experiences will be better by themselves. If you want to build an awesome bespoke story-driven, single player or a co-op game, you might build it off in its own little corner of the world, no connections to the outside, but an awful lot of what we're doing would be a whole lot better if it were all seamlessly connected. As Disneyland is itself, you get on all of these elaborate transport systems like the People Mover and the different cars go from place to place. You can go anywhere in this connected world and participate in any experience there. And what are creators doing instead of creating their own little isolated islands? They're taking over a portion of space in the world and they're defining the game roles there in different parts of space. We've done little experiments here and there along the way. Back in Fortnite Chapter 2 [Note: This eight-season chapter began in October 2019 and ended December 2021], there was a period where there was a bubble appearing around certain parts of the world. It changed the gameplay in that part. Imagine that writ large in the scale of a simulation with hundreds of millions of players and hundreds of thousands of creators. The final bit is interoperability of content and code. Battle Royale is mostly code written by Epic. Every creator's world is a mashup of their code and Epic's code. But things become really interesting when every creator's code can interoperate with every creator's code. Everybody's out creating their own really interesting objects and creating them using protocols that are provided by the system to enable them all to work together. So you might be riding a mount or an animal built by one creator and your friend might be driving a car built by another creator. You might be carrying a weapon built by a third creator, and you might be in a world maintained by dozens of other creators, and you might be moving seamlessly from place to place with all of these interactions happening. And you really expect that to work. An awful lot of the reasons that we've built Verse and our ecosystem the way we have is to allow for these future usage cases. If you just wanted to get Roblox style experience with a bunch of sharded islands deployed as quickly as possible, there were much faster ways we could have done that and much simpler trade-offs we could have made in the language and in the engine to achieve that. But we're building for the long term, and by the end of this decade I think an awful lot of this will have come to fruition and you'll see the ability of creators of all sorts to build things that are qualitatively different and better than they are today. Ball: Neal, we talked a little bit about Lamina1, and you have a novel coming out later this year that I want to get to, but you're also an advisor to Inworld.AI and a co-founder at Whenere. What are those latter two companies about? Stephenson: Yeah, so this has to do with what would I want to experience in the Metaverse. - where is the first place I would go. My co-founder at Whenere is Karen Laur, who was employee number 17 at Valve. She worked on Half-Life 1, and we ended up working together at Magic Leap building creative projects there. And towards the end of that time, we were messing around quite a bit with Sequencer, which was a component of Unreal Engine that is there to help people who want to make cinematic experiences. And through that, we got to know Kim Libreri and some of the team at the Northern California branch of Epic who were working on making Unreal Engine a tool for people who work in film and TV, not just games. And so what came out of all of that is this realization that graphics hardware and game engines have reached the point where you can now build immersive environments that most people would identify as of cinematic quality. If you're a professional movie director, you might see that it's not quite up to that level, but most people are essentially going to consider it a photorealistic environment. So that was kind of the first element of this. And then what came on a little bit later was Inworld.AI, and they're building a system that essentially makes it easy to connect large language models on the back end to avatars in the game engine. In effect, you can use a simple interface to essentially build the brain of a character. You can specify what this character knows, what they don't know, and what their personality traits are. You can map them onto a voice from a different company. The one we are using at the moment is called ElevenLabs. And then you can wire that in to an avatar in the game engine. We're using Unreal, we're using MetaHuman, which is another kind of cinematic feature that's been added to the engine in the last few years, which basically makes it easier for people to create, again, nearly photorealistic human avatars. So what it all adds up to is that to game in Whenere, all you have to do is talk. We have a speech-to-text subsystem in there that will transmit whatever you said to the character's brain in the backend. The brain will generate an appropriate response based on the knowledge base and the personality of that character, and send it back to the game engine as an utterance, which is it's text, it's the sound file generated by ElevenLabs, and it's a set of visemes, so the atoms of facial animation. So that the character will exhibit the right facial expressions and even the right emotional expressions that have been generated by the brain. And we first encountered this when we were working with an internal production team at Inworld to make a character Virj, who was part of the extended Snow Crash universe timeline. And we went in sort of with modest expectations and were just astounded by how well this thing worked and how interesting the results could be. And so I think zooming out for a second, the door that this opened for us is that the way that we interact with video game worlds has tended to be pretty limited, and most games still revolve around shooting things because that is a perfect match for the UI input devices that we've got. You use a mouse to put the crosshair where you want it, you click the button to fire the weapon or whatever, and you see something happen in the world, the world responds in a way that makes sense, and that's been a very powerful UI paradigm. But here for the first time, we were able to just sit and talk like normal people to this character and have an answer back. So based on that, we, Karen and I and Jamil Moledina co-founded Whenere last summer and we've been working since then on building a system that sits on top of Unreal Engine and on top of Inworld.AI, and its purpose is to enable users to immerse themselves in story worlds that they love. You go to Comic-Con, you go to any kind of fan environment, you see people who've traveled thousands of miles, they've spent thousands of dollars to make elaborate cosplay outfits, and it's all in the service of I love Game of Thrones or Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings or whatever, so much that I just want to spend more time in it. And we think that there's a way now to give those fans the ability to enter into such worlds, and not only to interact with them, but to mod those worlds, to come up with new ideas, new fan fiction storylines, or just to change the way the furniture's arranged or the way a character looks or talks. So we've been working away on that since about August and have been fairly quiet up to now, but we're going to be talking about it more in the coming weeks. Whenere, an AI storytelling platform from Neal Stephenson, Karen Laur, and Tadhg Kelly, is currently crowdfunding at Wefunder. Ball: Both of you create technology and you're also content creators. I'm interested in your perspective on AI training data and ethics. Sweeney: I think that outside of universities doing research, companies shouldn't train AI on data where they don't have clear and explicit permission from the creator of the data to do that. That was granted in a way that made either ownership or the right to train clear. If a company buys ownership of the data from the creator of the data or gets permission to use it for training AI, it’s fair game. And they shouldn’t train AI on that data if they don’t have that permission. And I think we have to treat research institutions differently when they're actually doing research because there's much more compelling public interest in advancing that research. I think it's rather unfortunate that like cryptocurrency, AI has been taken over by the Wild West with companies doing things that are rather astonishing and put them at odds with all the world's creators and an awful lot of the users as well. I think that's unfortunate because AI is a really important technology that is going to change the world. I think that after this first generation of rather wild practices fades away, we're going to see companies with a lot much more responsible data usage practices coming to the forefront and use of AI in a way that's much more well-thought-out and specialized to particular usage cases. I still think that the idea of creating a chatbot that's supposed to have all the world's knowledge and be an agent of good is a very long way from coming to fruition. And the folly of all the current efforts, both being lamed down to the point where they aren't as useful as they ought to be, but also doing things that are egregiously wrong, like telling you to eat rocks. It's kind of an artifact of this technology being adopted way too widely, way too quickly. But I think all of this stuff would've been awesome if it were the work of researchers for another decade or so before it were treated as a serious mainstream technology. And if instead of being a commercial product that's being licensed to enterprise customers around the world, if ChatGPT were, like, some university's chatbot, with this massive disclaimer of this chatbot might make stuff up and say ridiculous things at times and it's just no big deal, don't treat it too seriously. But unfortunately, everybody in their race to have their first mover advantage has gone away from the standards that govern most forms of technology development, and that's leading to regulatory backlash and all sorts of other problems, and that's very unfortunate. But I think as optimists for the future of technology, we shouldn't let that early misadventure with AI dissuade us from the long-term value of the technology. And so I'd encourage the same sort of patience I encourage with blockchain and cryptographic technology in the field of AI. Stephenson: I was just going to say that I think a lot of this has to do with the intent or the perceived intent of the people who are building these systems. They've shown kind of a remarkable propensity for shooting themselves in the foot by making statements that are very threatening to creators. And it's strange to me that they would focus on famous actresses or artists as we're going to replace you. It's a really odd series of PR gaffes. I'll say that as Tim says, this is going to develop more texture and complexity over time for Whenere, we wanted to avoid getting into issues around ownership of IP. And so we're starting with older books that are in the public domain. We've hired a researcher. The woman who's creating the brains of our characters is an accomplished researcher who's using open source public domain material to come up with the background information, what these characters know, what they understand, how they talk, and that's all kind of kept track of and footnoted so that we know where our training material originates from. Ball: Tim, another major gaming publisher's CEO recently said that within three years, he expects that GenAI will allow them to be 30% more efficient, expand their player network by 50% using personalization, culturalization and increased immersion, and 10 to 20% increases in ARPU. Others are more focused on creating new game genres or experiences using AI. How do you think about this tool set over the, say, longer time horizon when some of the ethics and legality and permissions are clarified, but where do you think the big opportunity is for game makers? Sweeney: I think generative AI will lead to dramatic productivity gains because of the ease of creation of objects that will meet your specific needs. If you want a bunch of cool trees, you can go into the Quixel library and get a tree off the shelf from us for free for Unreal Engine use. But if you want a specific tree that meets a specific need for a specific scene in your game, you can have a modeler build it right now, and that takes an enormous amount of time and expense. In the future you're going to be able to create a mashup by giving some high-level instructions as to exactly what kind of tree you create. And based on training data that was properly owned or licensed, it will make the tree you want. I see dramatic productivity gains coming to a lot of areas of game development. Also, I think that this will increase opportunities for all creators and increase employment opportunities in the industry as a whole, as have all other technological improvements that have come. We're going to take all the people we have and perhaps some more and build even bigger, better games using the technology. And so the technology is going to enable us to improve the scope and quality of our products and build bigger and better games. And so that will certainly come and it will come at different rates. You have to remember, the reason that we had a massive revolution in generative AI and text AI beginning last year was because of the 30 years of research that had gone into the foundations of how to train and manage those sorts of AIs. And particularly if you read some of the papers on this technology-powered stable diffusion image generation AI, they're solving a long complicated series of differential equations at the absolute leading edge of applied mathematics because they've spent the past 20 to 30 years figuring out how to do that. This AI isn't going to come to all fields with equal speed. 3D object generation AI isn't going to be revolutionized next year. It's probably going to take many years because a lot of the things that were done for 2D have not yet been done for 3D, nor does anybody know how to do them. And so there's a huge amount of research and development effort needed to unblock AI contributing to specific fields in specific new ways and creating game content at the level of quality that you expect. But I think this will be empowering and economically expanding and opportunity expanding for everybody in the industry. And it's very hard to predict the impact on game industry revenue or other metrics like that. But this is definitely going to bring us the capability of building better, bigger, and more compelling games faster. And because this technology will be ubiquitously available to everybody, we should expect the state of gaming to improve dramatically as a result of it. I think we should expect the entirety of the gaming economy to improve as well. Better games means players will be spending more. Better games means that companies get more returns by investing more in building games. And so you'll probably see increases in employment and you'll probably see a lifting of all ships and also an upending of a lot of things. In the early days, Epic artists drew pixels. Nowadays, Epic artists mostly model 3D objects. And the things that people do with their mouse clicks in the future will be different things than the things they do with their mouse clicks today. But I think the value of creators will not be undermined by AI in the long run because all of these companies are competing with each other. We need a lot of humans to make a lot of awesome creative decisions about how these games are to work. Now Available: “THE METAVERSE AND BUILDING THE SPATIAL INTERNET,” the fully revised and updated edition of my nationally bestselling (US, UK, Canada, China) and award-winning book (Best of 2022 by Amazon, The Guardian, FT China, The Economist’s Global Business Review, Barnes & Noble). Buy at Amazon, Apple, B&N, more. Ball: Neal, have you tried the Vision Pro? Stephenson: No. No, I haven't. Ball: Have you tried it, Tim? Sweeney: I have not. Ball: Why not? Stephenson: I simply haven't had the opportunity. I literally don't know how I would go about getting access to one, other than buying one and having it shipped to me, which I wouldn't be interested in doing. My drawer is full. The drawer where I put expensive goggles that I never use. Sweeney: We're doing a lot here and I have to prioritize. That's just me personally; the Unreal Engine team is supporting Vision Pro wholeheartedly. Ball: Tim, why were your Apple and Google lawsuits so critical to constructing the Metaverse? Sweeney: The Metaverse needs to evolve into a system that's way cooler and more powerful than the web. You're going to need the best capabilities of 3D engines, the best capabilities of economies, commerce and interoperability. You're going to need the best creation tools and the best creator deployment tools. And ultimately, what creators will be doing in building the Metaverse is not building a bunch of separate apps to go through Apple's approval process, but they're going to be contributing to a huge world that will evolve under extraordinarily complex rules. And it is vitally important that we not allow the gatekeepers, Apple and Google, to block progress on the Metaverse as they block progress on the web and block progress in computing in general. And the ways they do that are numerous, and they're also rather insidious. We take a lot of their past decisions for granted and don't realize how much they're undermining the quality and capabilities of the devices that we own and the capabilities that the devices we own could have if they weren't being so horrid. For example, Apple blocks web browser choice. By blocking competing web browser engines, they block web browsers from introducing new 3D standards from optimizing performance and from creating capabilities for web apps to have the power and performance and capabilities of native apps. You're not allowed to do any of these things on the web because Apple doesn’t want web apps to compete with native apps, since they collect 30% taxes on native apps and 0% on web apps. We should also expect the Metaverse to be an economically complex and expensive business to operate in which many creators are fully investing most of their profits or most of their revenue back into creating awesome content, with ecosystem companies, payment processors, and everybody competing with each other to offer the best value. And operating the Fortnite creator economy, we know that this is a very expensive thing to operate. It's not just like a game store like the Epic Games Store which sells other companies’ games. There's a massive amount of back-end services that have to be run including cloud service and hosting, content moderation and ecosystem safety costs. We're having humans intervene to make sure that what players are doing or what creators are doing are safe for everybody. There's a massive, massive set of costs. And if you let Apple and Google set the ground rules for the Metaverse, that tax they collect at the front end is going to constitute the far, far majority of profit that will ever be made from the Metaverse. And it would just go into their stock buybacks rather than those profits going to creators to reinvest in creating content, building better stuff, and engines and payment processors and other contributors to the overall Metaverse ecosystem. It would just be collected in junk fees and dividend it out to shareholders for doing absolutely nothing, which is what Apple and Google really do for the Metaverse. Nothing at all. And I guess equally importantly, they've placed themselves in a position of gatekeeping and saying the apps aren't allowed to do certain things. If you look at the Department of Justice's complaint against Apple, they're preventing broad categories of apps from even existing. If a US developer wanted to offer the same variety of services in the US that WeChat does in China, Apple would simply say no. They don't let you bundle together a useful app with a distribution vehicle for other companies’ apps. They don't let you advertise other companies’ apps or promote other companies’ apps. They don't allow you to run vast facets of an app economy that you'd normally have because they simply say, you cannot do this thing. There's all of that. And I don't think that the Metaverse can even exist on these mobile devices so long as they have those sorts of rules. By imposing huge sets of rules on what their competitors are allowed to do on devices customers have bought, they can prevent entire categories of software from existing and they will prevent the Metaverse from existing to the extent that they can't fully tax it. And if it is allowed to exist in the future, then it will exist as a vassal to Apple's fiefdom. And that's why it's so important that we win all of these fights and that world regulators and law enforcers stop these monopolies from using their control of the operating systems on these devices and over a trillion dollar digitally connected economy, which is exactly what they're doing now. Regulators are taking notice. The European Union, Japan, and UK have now passed really robust laws that will stop this, and the US is too captured by Apple at the moment to pass laws, but progress may be made and the fight continues worldwide. Ball: I have two final, more fun questions. The first time the three of us played Fortnite, Neal, you were Silver Surfer, Tim, you were an anthropomorphic jellyfish. Why those outfits? Neal, I'll start with you. Stephenson: A Silver Surfer is just a vintage comic book character who was sort of a cult favorite. Not one of the big name comic book characters, but had a cult following. And he was sort of brooding and kind of always going on about philosophical stuff. And there was a brief moment in the 90s when somebody wanted to make an update of Silver Surfer called Cyber Surfer, and my phone rang and that project went nowhere. I never really did anything or got paid. But so just when I saw Silver Surfer come up on as a skin you could get, I just clicked on it. Ball: And Tim, the jellyfish? Sweeney: I was on Twitter and telling a story about one of my Fortnite games and somebody replied saying like, \"Gee, you're CEO of Epic. When you beat somebody in Fortnite, don't you feel bad about that? This is one of your customers, and you just caused them to lose a Battle Royale game.\" That made me feel bad. But when I switched to a giant jellyfish that's like a foot taller than all the other characters with giant colorful tentacles sticking out of his head, the one character in Fortnite, that doesn't blend into any environment we've ever had, I feel better about that. And so playing as a giant jellyfish, it's bright purple and pink, makes me feel okay about playing a Battle Royale game and perhaps defeating other people because they have plenty of notice that I'm coming. Stephenson: Oh, is it generally known that that's your outfit? Sweeney: Yeah. And basically everybody who has a jellyfish profile picture, I follow them on Twitter because we Jellies have to stick together. Ball: Speaking of things we can see a long time coming, when the Metaverse does arrive to the extent in which that's ever a definable thing, do you think we'll use the term? And if not, what will it be? Sweeney: I hope so. If we use one company's word for it, if we call it Fortnite, then we've kind of failed to build the open version of it. So I would hope that it would actually be called the Metaverse and not some company's brand like Googling when you're searching the internet. So I hope so. Stephenson: We've kind of hit this topic previously earlier in the conversation. Matt, you were talking about is the Metaverse Dead? We see postmortems for the Metaverse. And yet on the other hand, Fortnite and Roblox and other such platforms have got vast numbers of people using them. We just don't generally refer to them as the Metaverse, but people who kind of understand the concept know that that's what they are. So I think it'll be something like that. But it's always been the case that the new technologies have a sort of currency in the language that eventually comes to seem sort of dated. So in the 30s, radio was this amazing kind of newish thing to a lot of people. And so you can still buy a little red wagons called Radio Flyer. It's just a wagon, it has nothing to do with radio, but 100 years ago, somebody thought it would be cool to put the word radio on the wagon because it had connotations of this is the thing of the future. And we see that with internet and with a whole lot of tech buzzwords that come and go over time. Ball: Finally, Neal, it has 32 years since Snow Crash. We're now just a few months from your next book, which comes out October 15. What can you tell us about? Neal: Yeah. It's going back to writing historical novels about science, which is something I enjoyed a lot when I wrote Cryptonomicon and then the Baroque Cycle. And so in this case, it's the beginning of a series about science, the development of physics in the 1930s and the 1940s, eventually leading up to the bomb. And in that world, there's a lot of amazing stories that for some reason haven't been told. And so I just found it to be a really exciting part of history when I started to kind of learn about it. And so each volume is going to center on a different specific character, but they all kind of know each other and they interact. So for Polostan, the character is a young woman who's got an American mother and a Russian father, and lives on the cultural boundary line between those two worlds during the Great Depression. She's a big fan of Bonnie and Clyde. She's a really interesting character, I think. So, yeah, that's coming out in mid-October. I'll be doing a book tour, be passing through Cary, North Carolina. So, but purchase your advanced copy now at a bookseller near you. Ball: I haven’t had a chance to read it yet, but eagerly looking forward! Tim, Neal, thanks again.

    "commentBody": "Interviewing Tim Sweeney and Neal Stephenson (matthewball.co)186 points by cubefox 17 hours agohidepastfavorite142 comments sanex 15 hours agoEvery interview I've watched with Neal lately I feel like he's tired of talking about a concept from his 2nd (technically third but we don't talk about that) book 30 years ago. He's written so much better stuff since then and I would love to hear him talk about basically any of that. reply wileydragonfly 14 hours agoparentI went to a book signing (Fall, or Dodge in Hell) and you could tell he was so worn out over discussing Snowcrash, and that was five years ago. Otherwise a very thoughtful Q&A session, though. A stark contrast from the Neil Gaiman thing I attended. I did find his vision of the internet being a dystopia of so much false information that people were hiring personal moderators to filter it very depressing and prescient. The book was a challenge, but by god I spent my money so I was finishing it. Felt like he had just discovered the book of Genesis and wanted a modern repeat of it. Always felt like you took a deep dive into Wikipedia when reading his books. reply JeremyNT 6 hours agorootparentLike many Stephenson novels I've read, I felt like Fall contained a pretty good book wrapped inside a pretty bad book. I finished it, but it was a slog. I could recommend reading the first half and then switching to the Wikipedia summary to see how it concludes. reply duskwuff 12 hours agoparentprev> (technically third but we don't talk about that) There's a story that he only allowed that book to be reprinted so that people would stop paying hundreds of dollars for a copy on eBay. reply wmf 14 hours agoparentprevNobody's forcing him to do interviews... or to start a metaverse startup. reply armada651 5 hours agorootparenthttps://youtu.be/vWRlxSGf_ns reply lynx23 13 hours agoparentprevMany well-known artists have this problem. Heck, my gf went to a K&D concert recently, and she described the same phenomenon. People were ok while the new stuff was being played. And since everyone was obviously waiting for it, they played their hits around the end, which is where the people were most excited. And thats justa a recent example. Some of the really good guys usually play over it, and reinvent themselves, ignoring what their fans want to hear. That said, I personally also prefer his earlier books. Granted, snowcrash was a young mans fever dream, and you kind of grow out of it. A young ladies illustrated primer? That was kinda cool. Quicksilver? Yeah, an unexpected history lesson woven into a pretty long story. Liked it. But seven eves? No. That one kind of killed my love for his work. I dont know why, but he kind of overdid the long-story-arc thing there. reply mvonballmo 9 hours agorootparentFor me it was Termination Shock that finally convinced me to stop reading his books. He just likes to write really long, repetitive and wildly overly detailed books. I was entertained by SevenEves and Reamde but I'm open to the possibility that I might very well react as I did to Termination Shock if I tried rereading them. Edit: I've read and very much enjoyed a ton of Stephenson (Cryptonomicon, The Baroque Cycle, Anathem) but his recent stuff is tailing off for me. I don't know if it's me or him. reply mrmlz 6 hours agorootparentI really liked Seveneves - i.e. the first part of it - the secondary add-on story fell a bit flat to me. reply lynx23 9 hours agorootparentprevAhh, I dont feel alone, thats nice. I didn't even know Termination Schock. But glancing over the wikipedia page for it, I immediately know this is definitely not my genre. Climate fiction, no thanks. reply The_Colonel 8 hours agorootparentprev> But seven eves? No. That one kind of killed my love for his work. I dont know why, but he kind of overdid the long-story-arc thing there. The first and the second part of the book (which constitute most of the book) stand on its own. I think it's better to pretend the 3rd part doesn't exist (which is IMHO rather easy since it's just unnecessary) than to discount the whole book. reply cubefox 15 hours agoparentprevHe does in the interview. reply __rito__ 10 hours agoprevI am just here to thank HN for introducing me to Neal Stephenson. My life has been made better by reading his books. It's so nice that someone writes books for smart people. All and every book I read before were for the lowest common denominator level of people. Sure, smart, educated, cultured, wise people could get more out of some of them (like Anna Karenina), but the books were written to be made accessible to each and every human. Getting to know Neal's works has brought in a paradigm shift in my reading and thinking, and now I read other authors like Greg Egan, too. Thanks to Neal for being himself. And thanks to HN for suggesting his works on books threads. I am reading Quicksilver right now, and read Anathem, Snow Crash, Cryptonomicon, Diamond Age before. Loved each one. If you are reading this comment, feel free to suggest me other authors or works, although not from Neal, as I will read ALL of his works, anyway. reply JeremyNT 5 hours agoparent> It's so nice that someone writes books for smart people. I've read a lot of Stephenson and I don't mean this as a knock against him exactly, just an observation: he writes in a way that is inclined to make the HN crowd (myself included) feel smart because we are the target audience. If you look at a lot of the protagonists, many of them are startup founders and game designers and coders and cryptographers and mathematicians, going on \"heroes' journeys\" where they save the world and/or get the girl. Nerds (aka hackers) who save the day. It's almost like it's engineered to stoke the egos of technologists. Stephenson (who - again - I have read a lot of, and admire in a lot of ways) will always feel to me like a bit of a relic from early Internet culture, where a sort of persona was idolized. The startup founder / hacker / clever man (it was always a man). A similar author to me is Andy Weir. reply The_Colonel 1 hour agorootparentI disagree. Neal's characters are mostly weak and forgettable. Even the storylines often seem to be playing second fiddle. The real power is in his imaginative and thought-through world building. I have close to zero recollection who was the hero in Anathem, instead I often come back mentally to the ideas around the concents and avout society. reply __rito__ 4 hours agorootparentprevThanks, I know all this. But if I spelled out all nuances and caveats, then that wouldn’t be a comment, right? Neal's books aren’t for smart people like Quantum Mechanics books are. I know. But then again, what is smartness? Isn't a lot of what smartness is, is having the right background and preparedness? All caveats and nuances can't be included everywhere, right? I read Andy Weir's Peoject Hail Mary. It's something that I liked, yeah, but would have much more appreciated when I was 17. Not right now. Now I like my books to be more wide, covering multiple aspects of reality. E.g., when you read Permutation City, it is not only some SciFi, but it enables you to think deep and hard about consciousness and self. I am yet to read Dune, but I think it is also a \"deep\" book. reply sprinkly-dust 6 hours agoparentprevIf you feel this way about the works of Neal Stephenson, might I suggest Cixin Liu? Though well-done in it's own right, the 3-Body Problem Netflix series does not quite do justice to the intricacy of Liu's writing in the Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy. You might find the change of pace to be somewhat jarring in comparison to Stephenson but it fulfills a similar enjoyment of Science Fiction. reply mberger 3 hours agorootparentI enjoyed 3 body problem. I found the sequels more of a collection of sci fi tropes than a good coherent story. You will get better original thoughts from David Brin, Stephen Baxter and Vernor Vinge reply __rito__ 4 hours agorootparentprevI read 3BP and loved the series. While not very high quality as literary works, the books are products of originality, and deep thought. I just appreciate that these books were written down. I kind of liked Exhalation by Ted Chiang. I have planned to read other works by Cixin Liu, and check out Ken Liu's works. Great suggestion, by the way. reply SSLy 7 hours agoparentprevqntm's stuff. Also \"This is how you lose the time war\" is both smart with the world building, and challenging in the good way with the prose. reply Vecr 5 hours agorootparentIs that anywhere close to the Quantum Thief series in research quality/accuracy? I've read physicists who say they can't get time travel to work even in fiction, it's just that incompatible with everything else. reply SSLy 5 hours agorootparentIt's implicitly about looping and diverging multi-multiverses. Not hardcore one-casualty-stream-only time travel. reply Vecr 5 hours agorootparentYeah, that's how you have to do it, but the main issues are 1) what do you care about, which actually surprisingly mostly boils down to how you calculate probabilities in multiverse situations and 2) how the hell do you find anything? Sure, you somehow jump to a different universe, but I can't think of a physics based reason why you'd be able to 1) get back to your original universe and 2) find any other one you jumped to previously ever again. reply SSLy 3 hours agorootparentI'd still at least try it. Sci Fi stuff in it is part of the charm, not the point. Maybe that's non-Stephensonian, I guess. reply trenchgun 10 hours agoparentprevI can recommend for example Hannu Rajaniemi and Peter Watts reply __rito__ 8 hours agorootparentThanks, I will check them out. Any more recommendations? reply dsr_ 7 hours agorootparentKarl Schroeder; Bruce Sterling; for far-future implications of tech, Linda Nagata. Elizabeth Bear's _Ancestral Night_. For magnificent scope, Sam Hughes (qntm)'s _Ra_ and _Fine Structure_. reply The_Colonel 1 hour agorootparentI can recommend Lockstep from Karl Schroeder. Scifi books rarely tackle the problem of huge distances, slower thab light speed travel and the resulting long time scales and their effects on multi-star civilizations (FTL is the usual boring cop-out). Lockstep provides an interesting take on the problem. reply __rito__ 4 hours agorootparentprevThanks! reply rkachowski 9 hours agorootparentprevseconded, the quantum thief series lives in my brain rent free reply stormking 9 hours agorootparentprevBoth great authors, both nothing like Stephenson. reply steve1977 8 hours agoparentprevNot in the style of Neal Stephenson, but if you like hard sci-fi Vernor Vinge and if you like trippy cyberpunk Rudy Rucker. reply mberger 3 hours agorootparentIn the same vein as Vernor Vinge, I would recommend Stephen Baxter. Stephen's writing always gives me the same feeling as when I look at the stars at night and am reminded that where I am is just a small part of everything. The manifold trilogy as well as the long earth series he did with Terry Pratchett are very good. The first is not anthropocentric, which I found was a refreshing change. reply madaxe_again 9 hours agoparentprevYou may also like Philip K Dick. There seems to be a decent intersection between fans of each, and while they’re radically different authors, they have the same heavy cerebral load - Dick makes you put the book down, stare into the middle distance, and go “whoa”. The kinds of books that leave a lasting imprint on your mind. Oh, and Iain M Banks. More accessible, I’d say, but no shortage of Big Ideas. reply teddyh 6 hours agorootparentI always found most of PKD’s short stories quite excellent, but all of his full-length books that I have read have been a slog. It’s quite telling that almost all of the movies based on his works have been based on his short stories, not novels. Therefore, I always recommend that people start reading his short stories, and avoid his books. See also:reply slothtrop 5 hours agorootparentThree Stigmata and DADOES are my favorites and they're full-length. The only one I didn't like was Valis. > It’s quite telling that almost all of the movies based on his works have been based on his short stories, not novels. Because that's easier to adapt to 2h films than a long novel? Lots of short stories become film. reply The_Colonel 7 hours agorootparentprevNeal's particular strength is in a detailed world-building. Dick created wild worlds, but they are not particularly fleshed out, kinda dream-like in their vagueness, therefore for me not \"convincing\" in the same way as Neal's worlds are. With Banks, the worlds (Culture being a major one) are more fleshed out, but somehow to me not as interesting. I've read several of his books, but somehow didn't enjoy the Culture ones a lot (read Player of Games, Use of Weapons and Excession). I did like the A Song of Stone a lot, but that's not even sci-fi. I'm aware my opinion is quite unpopular regarding Banks. reply slothtrop 5 hours agorootparentHe's detailed (maximalist as he likes to say), but I wouldn't call it worldbuilding (with exceptions). A fantasy author does that. He just gets into the nitty gritty about tech or ideas. reply The_Colonel 4 hours agorootparentWhy can this be called \"worldbuilding\" in fantasy, but not in sci-fi? His sci-fi books (Anathem, Diamong Age, Snow Crash) are not just detailing technology, but the whole society. All of the detailed descriptions about concents and avouts (in Anathem) is without any technology since they explicitly disawow technology. reply slothtrop 1 hour agorootparentLike I said, exceptions. I don't think tDA and SC do that much worldbuilding, speaking as someone who doesn't usually care for it. Those who ape the Tolkien high-fantasy school lean on it more, meandering descriptions. Anathem is actually my favorite. reply The_Colonel 29 minutes agorootparent> Those who ape the Tolkien high-fantasy school lean on it more, meandering descriptions You seem to have a very specific idea of what constitutes \"worldbuilding\". In my mind, every scifi has to do worldbuilding, because they deal with some non-existent worlds - they can't just rely on reader's being familiar with reality. They can't just say \"imagine it exactly like today's US, just with faster than light travel\". The authors have to describe the setting of the plot to the reader to at least some detail. Stephenson does that in my opinion very well and it's the main draw for me. reply __rito__ 8 hours agorootparentprev> \"...makes you put the book down, stare into the middle distance, and go “whoa”. The kinds of books that leave a lasting imprint on your mind.\" 100% solid agree. That's what makes a book worthwhile to read. I saw The Man in the High Castle series when I had time for webseries, and while it was kinda mid, it had some great aspects. Suggest more if you can. Need not be Sci Fi. reply ex-leper 7 hours agorootparentYou might like \"The shadow of the torturer\" by Gene Wolfe. Definitely had a few \"whoa\" moments in it for me. reply lynx23 8 hours agorootparentprevWell, obviously \"Do Androids dream of electric sheep\" simply because the movie left out a little bit too much, which you can catch up on when reading the book. Keyword \"Mood Organ\". I also liked \"Second variety\" which has also been rendered as a audio play IIRC. And, for the non-sci-fi part, A Scanner Darkly is pretty weird. Has also been rendered as a movie... reply slothtrop 6 hours agoparentprevDefinitely read Embassytown by China Mieville. I'll second the Cixin Liu rec (though his series is divisive), and also recommend Philip K Dick. reply mberger 3 hours agorootparentI read Embassytown and Daemon and Freedom(tm) by Daniel Suarez close together. I find they have an interesting theme throughout regarding the role of truth and manipulation. I would not recommend the sequels to 3 body problem. If you like big picture space opera, Existence by David Brin and Exultant by Stephen Baxter are better. reply lynx23 9 hours agoparentprevMy current hero is Greg Egan. I wish Incandescence had a sequel. I was sad when the book ended. Probably the best piece of hard sci-fi I've ever read. reply __rito__ 8 hours agorootparentI read Permutation City some months back, and it was truly great. Loved it. I am going to read many more of his books. reply markus_zhang 16 hours agoprevI have always believed that the Metaverse is whatever modern computing (especially the Internet) has evolved into. It has nothing to do with VR googles. You don't need AAA graphics to make an immersing world -- in fact, some text adventure games are quite immersive, and by the same principle you don't need VR to enter the Metaverse. Metaverse is escapism and alternative socializing in capital letters. For me, Metaverse in the 80s is me typing BASIC programs, playing Alley Cat, and watching a friend play Prince of Persia (in reality, not VR). Metaverse in the 90s is me borrowing pirated games from a friend and logging into BBS talking trash till early morning. It has always been here. It never left. It IS immersive. It doesn't need some VR devices to be \"more\" immersive. In fact, the more \"modern\" we become, the LESS immersive it seems to be, with all those online ads and other shits. Welcome to the Metaverse. reply cubefox 15 hours agoparentStephenson and Sweeney mean something else: User-generated 3D worlds where people interact with their avatars, e.g. to play games. Roblox and Fortnite are semi-early examples. VR is not required. reply w-ll 14 hours agorootparentppl never mention VRChat... that is the metaverse that people ask for imho... its wild, artistic, horny, and corny. its much like early internet. reply cubefox 13 hours agorootparent\"Horny\" but with hardly any women present, right? That may be why nobody wants to mention it. reply readyplayernull 15 hours agorootparentprevSecond Life was the metaverse 20 years ago, it fizzled for a reason. reply cubefox 15 hours agorootparentYes, one reason was that it didn't support games, or at least not very well. Roblox and Fortnite are far more popular than SL ever was. reply dpig_ 15 hours agorootparentDigital fiefdoms, how exciting. reply tenthirtyam 1 hour agoparentprevI remember an anecdote I heard when I was in high school. A teacher recounted how they had been listening to a radio talk show, and on the talk show, the presenter was interviewing an elderly lady about why she eschewed TV and preferred to listen to fiction shows on the radio. Her answer, apparently, was \"because the pictures are better.\" reply gxd 7 hours agoparentprevFor a minute there I thought I had written your message and forgot about it. It resonates strongly with how I feel. Infocom, the leading maker of the text adventures you talk about, used to advertise that the brain is the most powerful graphics technology (https://thedoteaters.com/?attachment_id=6312). When playing their games as a kid, I remember the sense of wonder with what then felt like an entire universe contained inside the computer. I tried to \"trick the computer\" into letting me go places that weren't technically part of the game! When thinking about the games back then - and I say that not with a sense of nostalgia, but simply remembering how I felt about these games before I understood how they worked - I wanted to go to every house in the scenery, every city building I was driving by. I wanted to see if I could go there, knock on the door and there would be people and adventures waiting for me everywhere. That dream was the metaverse indeed. Great graphics of course helps a lot, but they are not the main characteristic of this immersion. It's depth, content, the sense that every couch in the room could have a long lost and forgotten receipt under it. Adding people often breaks the immersion, especially in Free to Play games. When you are in a medieval world and suddenly a player called \"Memes4Ca$h\" dressed in a pink armor shows up, it breaks the immersion. The ideal environment would either need true human role players or AGI-managed characters. reply sirspacey 15 hours agoparentprevI thought so too until I used Supernatural on Quest 3. Immersion, like resolution, keeps leveling up in ways I don’t find easy to go back on. reply Cheer2171 15 hours agoparentprevthen we already had a word for it: media reply markus_zhang 15 hours agorootparentI'd say computing media (digitized media?) reply Ono-Sendai 15 hours agoprevI'm going to plug my open-source metaverse - Substrata (https://substrata.info/) - and talk about it a bit, since it seems relevant to a lot of the topics in this article. A single world: There is a single main Substrata world, which is filled with user-generated content and scripts. Rendering this and running physics for it is such a difficult technical problem that most other metaverses don't even try! Instead they tend to have lots of separate worlds / rooms. A single main world was important for me, partly as a result of reading Snow Crash. Technology sharing: I recently added Luau scripting, which is a fantastic Lua fork from Roblox. It allows sandboxed script execution, has a JIT mode, and has all the usual benefits of Lua (easy binding code etc.). Substrata also imports standard formats like GLTF. GLTF actually allows pretty good reuse of assets between metaverses. Crypto: Substrata optionally uses Ethereum NFTs for land - people can pay for land in Fiat, and then optionally mint the land as NFTs. The big advantage of using NFTs here is that allows land to be traded on the 'secondary market', without me having to do anything, and without my permission and involvement. If I didn't use crypto then i would need to implement some kind of marketplace myself, perhaps with an escrow system for land transfer etc, and have to deal with fraud and chargebacks etc. reply unwind 9 hours agoparentIf this was Reddit, someone would comment with just \"username checks out\". (In Gibson's \"Neuromancer\", an Ono-Sendai is a brand and/or type of cyberdeck). reply trenchgun 10 hours agoprevThis was a great answer: \"Stephenson: My overarching answer is that the actual market and actual users find ways to do things that we don't necessarily imagine in advance, just with our own limited perspective. And so cyberpunk had a whole aesthetic about it and still does, which to a large extent, revolved around having cool shit on your face. Mirror shades. Actually, one of the original anthologies of cyberpunk fiction was called Mirror Shades. And it was easy to assume back then that in order to truly experience a three-dimensional environment in an immersive way that you needed stereoscopy, you needed to have a different image slightly in each eyeball to give you a fully three-dimensional effect. And so there's always been this linkage in people's minds between cyberspace, the Metaverse, and goggles. What we've learned is way more nuanced and interesting than that. The year after Snow Crash came out was when Doom was released, and Doom is the ancestor of all games that are set in immersive environments [Note: Tim is nodding]. And it didn't require stereoscopy. It was all in a screen - very low resolution by current standards - and yet, the magic of the illusion was that you were running around in this three-dimensional persistent environment. And then since then, that kind of experience has only gotten better. And in the meantime, we've been learning things about goggles, about headsets and what they are and are not good at. And it took a long time for them to get to the point where [input/output] lag was acceptable. And so there's kind of this long period of time during which video games on screens were getting much, much, much better, but the acceptance of headsets was [falling] behind, because if lag is bad, you're more prone to get sick. One of the things that I became aware of when I was working at Magic Leap on AR headsets is that stereoscopy isn't enough. That your brain actually uses a lot of other cues other than stereoscopy to build a map of the three-dimensional world around you. And so people with one eye, one-eyed people can still perceive three-dimensionality, for example, because of these other mechanisms. This is a kind of a long-winded way of saying that the reality we've ended up with, which didn't seem plausible in 1990 when I was writing [Snow Crash], is that we've got billions of people fluently navigating highly realistic, immersive, three-dimensional worlds using flat screens and keyboard and mouse.\" reply gtsnexp 12 hours agoprevIs there a recording of this conversation somewhere? reply dtaht 14 hours agoprevMy favorite book of his was actually one of his earliest - Zodiac. reply superkuh 16 hours agoprevI'm kind of shocked Stephenson would associate with the kind of person that runs a company like Epic. I guess Epic's unethetical behavior is just not widely known. Epic bought Psyonix, makers of Rocket League, promised not to change anything, then 6 months later they stole the game from people who bought it for mac and linux. Now on those platforms there are no native clients for multiplayer. reply justin66 14 hours agoparent> I'm kind of shocked Stephenson would associate with the kind of person that runs a company like Epic.

For example, he claims that they won't support Linux because it's too niche but Linux has been (slightly) ahead of MacOS in the Steam survey for a while now (context: Fortnite is available on MacOS). Making is mistake is human, but he's sticking to his guns despite objective metrics to the contrary - I would expect more from a renowned CEO. reply justin66 3 hours agorootparentIt seems rather irrational of a company to turn away paying customers, right? Except his view isn't at all unique. They judge that Linux and its user base isn't big enough to be worth much of their time, but it's not like they're the only ones. Of course if you include the first half of the sentence you quoted it's obvious that I was talking about engineering when it comes to \"knows what he is talking about.\" The question of whether Linux is worth supporting is at least half a marketing question.

Try Cryptonomicon (if you like history/math) or Anathem (if you like sci fi/math) or The Diamond Age (if you like sci fi). reply aetherson 16 hours agorootparentI think that Snow Crash is good, but those are three of his best books, too. I appear to be a little odd in liking Reamde as much as I do, but if you want something lower-concept and more thriller-like, I really enjoy Reamde. reply swells34 15 hours agorootparentThose three and REAMDE (which I'm currently rereading) are just fantastic. Snow Crash was very stylized; too much for some tastes, not enough for others. reply netule 15 hours agorootparentI loved REAMDE until a little more than halfway through, when it became a DNF for me. reply sangnoir 14 hours agorootparentIMO, Stephenson's books are too long for the stories they tell, especially the final 25-33% - those can be a real slog. I gave up on Seveneves at about 90% or the book, reading it was no longer fun. I read a handful of his prior work to completion when I was a book completionist, so I can't tell of it says anything about the nature of the novels, or my own perseverance. reply ljlolel 14 hours agorootparentI’d say the first half set up is the always the slog with his books and the best part payoff is the end. reply actionfromafar 9 hours agorootparentSeveneves are very much two books.

Stephenson actually mentions the anthology in the interview. Snow Crash is relatively tame compared to some books by Williamson and Sterling. I think the idea is that you wouldn't understand everything either if you were actually transported into the future: there would be a ton of new terminologies, unfamiliar concepts, and a changed culture that takes different things to be a matter of course. reply ezekg 14 hours agorootparentAh, so maybe I just don't like cyber punk then. I usually stick to hard sci-fi. :D reply somenameforme 14 hours agoparentprevI had a somewhat analogous experience with Seveneves, which many people have recommended endlessly. At some point in the book, around half way IIRC, there is an event that happens which explains the title. And it goes from something like an interesting hard sci-fi, to a sort of weird meandering fantasy thing that took a nuke to my suspension of disbelief. It also felt like the book was basically two entirely different books at that point. I simply could not get into it, or passed it. reply uncanneyvalley 13 hours agorootparentSeveneves is the only Stephenson book I haven’t reread, and it’s because I don’t want to encounter that event again. I suppose I understand why he made that choice, but I don’t have to like it. reply nradclif 16 hours agoparentprevStephenson had a rough start in my opinion—Snow Crash isn’t really his best. Try Anathem instead. If you don’t like that, you probably won’t like Stephenson. reply The_Colonel 16 hours agoparentprevStephenson is for me a hit and miss author. I adore The Diamong Age, Anathem, Seveneves. I didn't finish the first book of Baroque Cycle and Cryptonomicon. Some of his other books I don't plan reading since I don't expect them to be good. I'd say Anathem is his best book overall, but the first 100 or so pages is almost pure world building without much action which might turn people away. Seveneves is close and is more accessible from the beginning. Just skip the last (after time jump) part of the book which is... unnecessary and bad. reply Carrok 15 hours agorootparentAfter the time jump was fantastic. Is it directly related to the first half? Maybe not, but it's a well thought out picture of what happens as that timeline continues on. Plus it's just fun. I love the entire book (Seveneves). reply The_Colonel 7 hours agorootparent> a well thought out picture of what happens as that timeline continues on TBH it seemed very ... \"idealistic\" in a way, \"racist\" would be another word, but I'd like to avoid the word's moral connotations. Just the idea that the descendants of this particular Eve are physically strong and then descendants of this Eve are intellectuals. It kinda seemed like a fairy tale instead of an actual development, which would realistically end up way more \"messy\". reply EdwardCoffin 5 hours agorootparentMy impression was that with this part he was trying to come up with his own version of the fantasy trope of different races with different characteristics (orcs, elves, men, etc), and imagining a situation that could produce such. reply X-Istence 15 hours agorootparentprevAnathem was almost unreadable due to the aforementioned world building but also apparently needing to redefine every single last word in the dictionary. But Cryptonomicon, Snow Crash and REAMDE were amazing. reply the_other 11 hours agorootparentprev> I didn't finish the first book of Baroque Cycle I found the first one a slog, but the second one more than made up for it.

(At least… that’s how I recall them >15 years on) reply slothtrop 5 hours agorootparentprevI had trouble with the Baroque Cycle and did not bother to finish, but stuck with Cryptonomicon and it was completely worth it. Otherwise agree with your picks. On Seveneves, no two people seem to agree on which half of the book is \"bad\", but I will say in general that the first half is more popular among the base. I thought the latter was fine. reply ABraidotti 16 hours agoparentprevI'm a big sci-fi reader as well, and I'm on a tear this year after neglecting the genre for about a decade. I find Stephenson's books to take a lot of headspace, and I don't always have that. But I do like giving books another shot at my time after a few years. I finally gave Bacigalupi's The Windup Girl another attempt and I'm enjoying it much more than I thought I would. reply oersted 11 hours agoparentprevDefinitely Snow Crash was challenging and shows its age. Some of his older books have similar bizarro vibes, I could not get into The Diamond Age the first try. Seveneves was much more accessible, as was The Rise and Fall of DODO, and the Baroque Cycle. Fall or Dodge in Hell is a bit more challenging but for different reasons than his early works, the subject matter is just more abstract. No doubt they are all meandering and longwinded, the newer ones perhaps more so, but that’s Stephenson, it can be a strength and a weakness. reply lz400 16 hours agoparentprevAlso a big sci-fi reader.

But the pseudo-scientific feel of the Sumerian stuff just completely turned me off, I couldn't decide whether it was meant to be serious or a parody of really bad cyberpunk. reply QuesnayJr 6 hours agorootparentIt telegraphs very strongly that it's not meant to be taken seriously. The main character's name is Hiro Protagonist, for example. reply teddyh 5 hours agorootparent> The main character's name is Hiro Protagonist, for example. It actually isn’t.

I.e. the name is an obvious marketing gimmick. reply jimbob45 12 hours agoparentprevThought it was just me. I'm into sci-fi for the ideas and there were too few interesting ideas and too much fluff around them. Better authors have been able to communicate more interesting ideas in many less pages. It's why I think short stories are the ideal medium for sci-fi. reply Barrin92 16 hours agoparentprevI also read a lot of sci fi and honestly I never really got Stephenson either. In particular the most popular stuff, Anathem, Cryptonomicon, the history trilogy just has so much Encyclopedia like infodumps in it, it was a slog for me. Honestly his books that people don't talk about often I found more interesting, like Zodiac which is a shorter eco thriller and even Reamde even though it was long it at least has a really interesting plot going for it. My biggest problem with him is, and I don't really mean it as an insult, but he's like a poor man's Pynchon or Hesse. If you like maximalist and historical fiction or like reading about people in monasteries might as well pick up GR or The Glass Bead game. reply sailfast 15 hours agorootparentI don't recall laughing out loud reading Siddhartha, but man I laugh my ass off every time I read Cryptonomicon, as well as a lot of his other books. They're often over-the-top wink-wink caricatures and often full of humor and clever references. reply knowaveragejoe 14 hours agoprev> I think that it takes a lot of discipline in the minds of technologists to separate the good from the bad of crypto. There is actually a great deal of good in the technology, separate from the bad uses of it that we've seen over the past, and I think we should be open-minded to the learnings to be made from there. It's so hard to get past this, and it's intuitive and understandable to me why that's the case - given the state of \"web3\".

It doesn't need to be significant. Just the metahuman mesh. reply jmyeet 16 hours agoprevThe Metaverse is something companies want to happen (and monetize) more than any users actually want it. VR is a niche. Wearing a clumsy headset will I think pretty much always be a niche. I didn't realize Sweeney was so bullish on it. The Metaverse is a bit like federated services: it springs from some idealism rather than giving users anything they actually want or need. The Apple lawsuit, in hindsight, I think was a serious miscalculation. I think Apple's (and Google's) monopolies will end but they won't let them go willingly and it'll be worse for both companies because it'll be Congress and the EU who will decide how that works. A court action is a way to force the issue earlier under existing legislation but only if you win. And Epic most clearly did not. So Apple is emboldened. There should be no reason that Netflix or Amazon or Epic should have to pay the Apple 30% tax (it's probably less by some agreement they have) on digital purchases purely through their existing payment platforms. That seemed like the most natural way to attack the monopoly (which is both a monopoly on distribution and payments).

Being able to create marketplace-style item trading would be a big cash cow (see: steam's fee on marketplace sales). But it's obvious why it's mostly under 18 who play it and spend money on the hats specifically to look cool or to impress others. At a certain point you realize there's not much value in it unless you enjoy specifically seeing those hats yourself whenever you use the product.

    "originBody": "The /llms.txt file A proposal to standardise on using an /llms.txt file to provide information to help LLMs use a website at inference time. Author Jeremy Howard Published September 3, 2024 Background Today websites are not just used to provide information to people, but they are also used to provide information to large language models. For instance, language models are often used to enhance development environments used by coders, with many systems including an option to ingest information about programming libraries and APIs from website documentation. Providing information for language models is a little different to providing information for humans, although there is plenty of overlap. Language models generally like to have information in a more concise form. This can be more similar to what a human expert would want to read. Language models can ingest a lot of information quickly, so it can be helpful to have a single place where all of the key information can be collated—not for training (since training generally involved scraping all pages in all readable formats), but for helping users accessing the site via AI helpers. Context windows are too small to handle most websites in their entirety, and converting HTML pages with complex navigation, ads, Javascript, etc into LLM-friendly plain text documents is difficult and imprecise. Therefore it would be helpful if there was a way to identify the most important information to provide to AI helpers, in the most appropriate form. Proposal llms.txt logo We propose that those interested in providing LLM-friendly content add a /llms.txt file to their site. This is a markdown file that provides brief background information and guidance, along with links to markdown files (which can also link to external sites) providing more detailed information. This can be used, for instance, in order to provide information necessary for coders to use a library, or as part of research to learn about a person or organization and so forth. You are free to use the llms.txt logo on your site to indicate your support if you wish. llms.txt markdown is human and LLM readable, but is also in a precise format allowing fixed processing methods (i.e. classical programming techniques such as parsers and regex). For instance, there is an llms-txt project providing a CLI and Python module for parsing llms.txt files and generating LLM context from them. There is also a sample JavaScript implementation. We furthermore propose that pages on websites that have information that might be useful for LLMs to read provide a clean markdown version of those pages at the same URL as the original page, but with .md appended. (URLs without file names should append index.html.md instead.) The FastHTML project follows these two proposals for its documentation. For instance, here is the FastHTML docs llms.txt. And here is an example of a regular HTML docs page, along with exact same URL but with a .md extension. Note that all nbdev projects now create .md versions of all pages by default, and all Answer.AI and fast.ai software projects using nbdev have had their docs regenerated with this feature—for instance, see the markdown version of fastcore’s docments module. This proposal does not include any particular recommendation for how to process the file, since it will depend on the application. For example, FastHTML automatically builds a new version of two markdown files including the contents of the linked URLs, using an XML-based structure suitable for use in LLMs such as Claude. The two files are: llms-ctx.txt, which does not include the optional URLs, and llms-ctx-full.txt, which does include them. They are created using the llms_txt2ctx command line application, and the FastHTML documentation includes information for users about how to use them. llms.txt files can be used in various scenarios. For software libraries, they can provide a structured overview of documentation, making it easier for LLMs to locate specific features or usage examples. In corporate websites, they can outline organizational structure and key information sources. Information about new legislation and necessary background and context could be curated in an llms.txt file to help stakeholders understand it. llms.txt files can be adapted for various domains. Personal portfolio or CV websites could use them to help answer questions about an individual. In e-commerce, they could outline product categories and policies. Educational institutions might use them to summarize course offerings and resources. Format At the moment the most widely and easily understood format for language models is Markdown. Simply showing where key Markdown files can be found is a great first step. Providing some basic structure helps a language model to find where the information it needs can come from. The llms.txt file is unusual in that it uses Markdown to structure the information rather than a classic structured format such as XML. The reason for this is that we expect many of these files to be read by language models and agents. Having said that, the information in llms.txt follows a specific format and can be read using standard programmatic-based tools. The llms.txt file spec is for files located in the root path /llms.txt of a website (or, optionally, in a subpath). A file following the spec contains the following sections as markdown, in the specific order: An H1 with the name of the project or site. This is the only required section A blockquote with a short summary of the project, containing key information necessary for understanding the rest of the file Zero or more markdown sections (e.g. paragraphs, lists, etc) of any type except headings, containing more detailed information about the project and how to interpret the provided files Zero or more markdown sections delimited by H2 headers, containing “file lists” of URLs where further detail is available Each “file list” is a markdown list, containing a required markdown hyperlink [name](url), then optionally a : and notes about the file. Here is a mock example: # Title > Optional description goes here Optional details go here ## Section name - [Link title](https://link_url): Optional link details ## Optional - [Link title](https://link_url) Note that the “Optional” section has a special meaning—if it’s included, the URLs provided there can be skipped if a shorter context is needed. Use it for secondary information which can often be skipped. Existing standards llms.txt is designed to coexist with current web standards. While sitemaps list all pages for search engines, llms.txt offers a curated overview for LLMs. It can complement robots.txt by providing context for allowed content. The file can also reference structured data markup used on the site, helping LLMs understand how to interpret this information in context. The approach of standardising on a path for the file follows the approach of /robots.txt and /sitemap.xml. robots.txt and llms.txt have different purposes—robots.txt is generally used to let automated tools what access to a site is considered acceptable, such as for search indexing bots. On the other hand, llms.txt information will often be used on demand when a user explicitly requesting information about a topic, such as when including a coding library’s documentation in a project, or when asking a chat bot with search functiontionality for information. Our expectation is that llms.txt will mainly be useful for inference, i.e. at the time a user is seeking assistance, as opposed to for training. However, perhaps if llms.txt usage becomes widespread, future training runs could take advantage of the information in llms.txt files too. sitemap.xml is a list of all the indexable human-readable information available on a site. This isn’t a substitute for llms.txt since it: Often won’t have the LLM-readable versions of pages listed Doesn’t include URLs to external sites, even although they might be helpful to understand the information Will generally cover documents that in aggregate will be too large to fit in an LLM context window, and will include a lot of information that isn’t necessary to understand the site. Example Here’s an example of llms.txt, in this case a cut down version of the file used for the FastHTML project (see also the full version: # FastHTML > FastHTML is a python library which brings together Starlette, Uvicorn, HTMX, and fastcore's `FT` \"FastTags\" into a library for creating server-rendered hypermedia applications. Important notes: - Although parts of its API are inspired by FastAPI, it is *not* compatible with FastAPI syntax and is not targeted at creating API services - FastHTML is compatible with JS-native web components and any vanilla JS library, but not with React, Vue, or Svelte. ## Docs - [FastHTML quick start](https://docs.fastht.ml/path/quickstart.html.md): A brief overview of many FastHTML features - [HTMX reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/path/reference.md): Brief description of all HTMX attributes, CSS classes, headers, events, extensions, js lib methods, and config options ## Examples - [Todo list application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/path/adv_app.py): Detailed walk-thru of a complete CRUD app in FastHTML showing idiomatic use of FastHTML and HTMX patterns. ## Optional - [Starlette full documentation](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/path/starlette-sml.md): A subset of the Starlette documentation useful for FastHTML development. To create effective llms.txt files, consider these guidelines: Use concise, clear language. When linking to resources, include brief, informative descriptions. Avoid ambiguous terms or unexplained jargon. Run a tool that expands your llms.txt file into an LLM context file and test a number of language models to see if they can answer questions about your content. Next steps The llms.txt specification is open for community input. A GitHub repository hosts this informal overview, allowing for version control and public discussion. A community discord channel is available for sharing implementation experiences and discussing best practices.",

Good UX is now for machines, not for humans! Shouldn't something like this be first and foremost for humans ... which also benefits machines as an obvious side-effect? reply kmod 3 hours agoparentThis reminds me about the Semantic Web, which was a movement explicitly about making the web more understandable to machines. I don't agree with the ideas and I think a lot of other people were also skeptical, but I bring it up to say that some people take the other side of your argument rather seriously and that there's a lot of existing debate on the topic. Here's Tim Berners-Lee talking about this way back in 1999: > I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A \"Semantic Web\", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The \"intelligent agents\" people have touted for ages will finally materialize. I quoted this from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web since the original reference was a book that is not openly accessible. Also I think it's funny that he's talking about agents in exactly the same way that people do now. reply PaulHoule 5 hours agoparentprevIt seems not thought through at all, just an attempt to get on the LLM bandwagon, like Facebook's giving up on Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas VR (would be so much fun and the gfx would probably work great) for a \"pivot to AI\" which just seems to be mindless flocking with an inevitable pivot to something else in another year and a half when they realize they spend $20B building a model and got $20M worth of revenue. reply hobofan 4 hours agoparentprevThis isn't good UX for machines. This is a patch for bad UX to help LLMs out in those cases. Some websites have the same patch for humans in the form of a \"Help\" or \"About\" section that details how the page is to be used/interpreted. This essentially just places those same instructions into a well-known location, so that LLM-based agents don't first have to crawl the website for such an instructional page (which may or may not exist). If you have good UX these instructions should be largely moot for both machines and humans, and bring machines on the same page as humans that may have additional context (e.g. where the site was linked; previous visits to the website). reply spencerchubb 6 hours agoparentprevIt's recognizing that the needs of a human are different from the needs of an LLM. reply apwell23 2 hours agoparentprev> Shouldn't something like this be first and foremost for humans ... which also benefits machines as an obvious side-effect? no because machines can put up with large walls of text but humans need exciting ux to keep their attention. reply LeoPanthera 16 hours agoprevCan we not put another file in the root please?

It's exceedingly unlikely that a website is going to just happen to make content available in a hidden directory path without it being created by automated tooling (which would likely be aware of such standards). The entire point is to avoid adopting a path that people already publicly use for something else. A hidden directory is the best way to do that. reply teddyh 5 hours agorootparentprevA URL path is not a directory path; there is no reason to assume that a path must be served by a directory by the same name. I mean, do you assume that there somewhere exists an actual machine with its Unix hostname set to “news.ycombinator.com”? reply baby_souffle 4 hours agorootparent> there is no reason to assume that a path must be served by a directory by the same name Other than static sites, sure. reply teddyh 3 hours agorootparentEven static sites might be served out of a simple hash table in RAM.

There's zero guidance on configuring how URIs under `/.well-known/` should be served at all, is there? They just reserve/sandbox the initial path component for the URI schemes which support it. That's it. It's the developers' choice to implement it as a directory - hidden or otherwise - on a filesystem; neither RFC says they SHOULD or MUST be served in such a way. (The updated RFC says \"e.g., on a filesystem\" in section 4.1, and mentions directories in section 4.4 in a way that, to my eyes, pretty much recommends against making it hidden) reply ftmch 15 hours agorootparentprevAlso \"well-known\" was always such an awkward name to me. reply tbrownaw 13 hours agorootparentIt's a joke about things being described as needing to be put at \"well known\" paths. reply seeknotfind 16 hours agorootparentprevHow about an LLM agent which automatically finds inconsistencies in RFCs. reply lolinder 6 hours agoparentprevOP replied to this complaint in a top-level comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41442092 They're correct that the RFC technically requires registration, and looking through the existing list of contact information for registrations I'd be likewise intimidated to attempt to register something that's experimental. reply jacoblambda 15 hours agoparentprevFwiw the active RFC is 8615 as RFC5785 is obsolete. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8615 reply pasiaj 10 hours agorootparentHaving two different RFCs on this is clearly causing confusion!

And you could look at whatever your LLM trigger log looks like, and have a DELETE_ME link. (right_to_be_un_vectorized) reply jph00 13 hours agoprevHi Jeremy here. Nice to see this on HN. To explain the reasoning for this proposal, by way of an example: I recently released FastHTML, a small library for creating hypermedia applications, and by far the most common concern I've received from potential users is that language models aren't able to help use it, since it was created after the knowledge cutoff of current models. IDEs like Cursor let you add docs to the model context, which is a great solution to this issue -- except what docs should you add? The idea is that if you, as a site creator, want to make it easier for systems like Cursor to use your docs, then you can provide a small text file linking to the AI-friendly documentation you think is most likely to be helpful in the context window. Of course, these systems already are perfectly capable of doing their own automated scraping, but the results aren't that great. They don't really know what's needed to be in context to get the key foundational information, and some of that information might be on external sites anyway. I've found I get dramatically better results by carefully curating the context for my prompts for each system I use, and it seems like a waste of time for everyone to redo the same work of this curation, rather than the site owner doing it once for every visitor that needs it. I've also found this very useful with Claude Projects. llms.txt isn't really designed to help with scraping; it's designed to help end-users use the information on web sites with the help of AI, for web-site owners interested in doing that. It's orthogonal to robots.txt, which is used to let bots know what they may and may not access. (If folks feel like this proposal is helpful, then it might be worth registering with /.well-known/. Since the RFC for that says \"Applications that wish to mint new well-known URIs MUST register them\", and I don't even know if people are interested in this, it felt a bit soon to be registering it now.) reply crowcroft 5 hours agoparentI understand the problem, but I'm not convinced this solution would do much to solve the problem? 1. LLMs give this doc special preference and SEO type optimisation will run rampant by brands. 2. LLMs crawl this as just another page, and then you need to ask yourself why isn't this context already on the website? reply jsheard 20 hours agoprevI'm just left wondering who would volunteer to make their sites easier to scrape. The trend has been the opposite with more and more sites trying to keep LLM scrapers out, whether by politely asking them to go away via robots.txt or proactively blocking their requests entirely. reply phren0logy 20 hours agoparentPeople who have information they want to share? Programming library docs seem like an obvious choice... reply ray_v 17 hours agorootparentOstensibly, everyone posting information on the open web want to share information -- either directly with people or indirectly via search engines _and_ the current crop of llms (which in my mind, serve the same purpose as search engines) I suppose the thing that people maybe don't agree with is the lack of attribution when llms regurgitate information back at the user. That, and the fact that these services are also overly aggressive when it comes to spidering your site reply haswell 15 hours agorootparentThat’s really my primary issue. Google indexing my content and directing traffic to my site is one thing. But unlike search indexing, there is no exchange of value when these LLMs are trained on my content. We all collectively get nothing for our work. It’s theft dressed up as business as usual. I’ll do whatever I reasonably can to avoid feeding the machine and hope some of the ongoing and inevitable legal fights will rein things in a bit. reply 0x1064 5 hours agorootparentThis is only true when a site's information is its only utility, such as for blogs. This is untrue when the information relates to a tool that would be consumed outside of the use of the model. reply haswell 4 hours agorootparentI was primarily agreeing with the sentiment that making it easier for companies to consume my work is a hard sell. I realize not all sites fall into this category. reply jph00 12 hours agorootparentprevThis proposal isn’t really for training. It’s for end users who want to know what information to include when they’re using models. reply haswell 4 hours agorootparentI get that. My point is that I’m uninterested in making it easier for LLM products to interact with my sites. I realize there may be products that may benefit from this. I was just agreeing with the sentiment that I want no part in it. reply krmboya 14 hours agorootparentprevAt least with the open source models we do get something back.. reply haswell 4 hours agorootparentThat’s debatable. The end result is still potentially making your own content obsolete/unnecessary and these “open weight” models are still trained without the permission of creators (there are no true open source models at this point). The people receiving the most value from these models are almost universally not the original content creators. The fact that I can use the model for my own purposes is potentially nice? But I’m not really interested in that and this doesn’t represent what I’d consider a reasonable exchange for using my work. It still drives people away from the source material. reply autoexec 15 hours agorootparentprevI like sharing information. Information wants to be free after all. Companies on the other hand want to charge people money to use their LLMs and associated AI products, so suddenly we've got a bunch of people profiting off of our content, potentially butchering it or hallucinating all over it in the process. reply Nullabillity 1 hour agorootparentprevIf you want to share information then you presumably don't want it to be regurgitated to be subtly wrong. The only use case I see here would be if it can be poisoned to reject queries about the area and direct readers to the source instead. reply ljm 16 hours agorootparentprevThe only reason legit docs are hard to find is because they don’t have Google ads on them and they don’t do SEO. The solution to the problem isn’t AI. The solution is to break Google’s stranglehold on the web by regulating it. The solution is to get government up to speed by making it contemporary, so it can understand and respond to current issues. Not leaving it up to people who had their time several decades ago and can’t let go. reply knowaveragejoe 14 hours agorootparentMaybe I don't work with niche enough software, but I rarely found docs particularly hard to find. For me, one of the real benefits of using an LLM is in making it easier to find where in the docs to look, or distilling exhaustive docs into common use cases.

I would expect that anything that looks remotely like a URL will be collected and scraped no matter what format it's in. reply jph00 10 hours agorootparentContext windows for LLM inference are limited. You can't just throw everything into it -- it won't all fit, and larger amounts of context are slower and more expensive. So it's important to have a carefully curated set of well-formatted documents to work with. reply fny 16 hours agoprevThere’s a deep irony that I have to make a file to help LLMs scrape content while others claim AI will doom humanity. A few deep ironies actually. reply mrweasel 10 hours agoprevWouldn't this open up for manipulating LLMs?

Of course this then leads to a problem. Your API client isn't allowed to invoke hard coded actions or access hard coded fields, it must automatically adjust itself whenever the API changes.

Well, for one, there is not nearly enough utilized resources in the world to solve poverty. Taxing everything we can get our hands on would still only provide a fraction of what would be needed to solve poverty. As things sit today, it is mathematically impossible to solve poverty. There is all kinds of unutilized resources, namely human capital, that could potentially see an end to poverty if fully utilized, but you will never tax your way into utilizing unutilzed resources. A tool to unlock those resources would be useful, and, indeed, there are efforts underway to try and develop those tools, but we don't yet have the technology.

It's common to use the host's firewall as well (nftables, firewalld, or iptables). You can do it at the webserver too, with access.conf in nginx. Apache uses mod_authz. I usually do it at the network though so it uses the least amount of resources (no connection ever gets to the webserver). Though if you only have access to your webserver it's faster to ban it there than to send a request to the network team (depending on your org, some orgs might have this automated). reply otherme123 4 hours agorootparentprevIn your nginx, server section: deny 1.2.3.0/24; And all 256 ips from 1.2.3.0 to 1.2.3.255 get banned.

    "originLink": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3496192/court-handcuffs-employees-with-non-compete-agreements-again.html",
    "originBody": "For a brief moment, it appeared employees would no longer be locked into jobs with arbitrary, non-compete contracts. But a recent court decision has workers back in non-compete jail. Credit: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock I hate non-compete contracts — and I’m not alone. They restrict workers’ ability to move from job to job, which in turn reduces salaries. The only way I ever got a significant raise during my career was when I changed employers. So, when the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) banned non-compete agreements, I, and a few million employees, were pleased as punch. That happiness was brief. Before the ban could even take effect on Sept. 4 (two days after Labor Day in the US), District Court Judge Ada Brown in Dallas stopped the FTC from enforcing it, saying the move “exceeded its statutory authority,” was “arbitrary and capricious” and would have caused businesses “irreparable harm.” Yeah. Right. I’ve been an employee, a freelancer, and I’ve owned small businesses. Non-compete agreements have only hurt me in the first two cases, and I never found a reason as a boss for requiring my employees to sign a non-compete contract clause. I know there are times when these agreements do make sense. If I invented a better mouse trap, I wouldn’t want my engineers taking the cheese to rival Acme Giant Mouse Trap Inc. But more often than not, the non-compete clauses I’ve seen are just there to trap employees. You might think these things are only a pain for people like me who work in the tech and creative space. You’d be wrong. Employees also locked into their jobs include hairdressers, janitors, security guards, and fast-food workers. Who knew that the ability to say, “Would you like fries with that?” was proprietary? Not me. Altogether, the FTC estimated that the ban could increase workers’ earnings by at least $400 billion over the next decade, affecting about 30 million American workers. It was a nice dream while it lasted. Essentially, Brown ruled that the federal agency lacked the statutory authority to enact such a sweeping ban and violated the US Administrative Procedures Act. She emphasized that Congress or individual states, not federal agencies, are the organizations that can regulate non-compete agreements. This is all part of an overriding conservative legal argument that federal agencies have minimal powers. That wasn’t always the case. For decades, a Supreme Court ruling in the 1984 case, Natural Resources Defense Council, required federal courts to defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute that the agency was tasked with administering. This became known as the Chevron Doctrine. I favored Chevron because, while I’m no lawyer, I know enough about regulatory law to know that the “law” usually only offers general guidelines on difficult, detailed issues. If you think, for example, your average Congresscritter has a clue about how, say, net neutrality really works, think again. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and FTC have the experts to nail the specifics; Congress doesn’t — and neither does your state legislature. Unfortunately, the Trump-appointee-dominated Supreme Court trashed Chevron with this year’s Loper Bright decision. And it doesn’t put the ball back in Congress’s court to make incredibly detailed laws. As the Cleary Gottlieb law firm put it, it’s now up to “federal courts to draw their own conclusions about the correct legal interpretation of otherwise ambiguous federal statutes.” Oh boy, judges will now get the final say on setting detailed policy. I’m thrilled. This is just another chapter in the ongoing debate over the balance of power between federal agencies and the judiciary. Given how the courts, especially the Supreme Court, have been ruling lately, I’m not a happy camper. The FTC isn’t happy, either. I expect it will appeal. (I don’t have high hopes for their chances with the current Supreme Court.) In any case, the FTC will continue to address non-compete agreements through case-by-case enforcement actions. The chances it will have much success are slim, but we live in hope. While the FTC contemplates its next steps, businesses and employees remain in a state of limbo regarding the fate of non-compete agreements. I expect businesses will hang on to their agreements until the FTC or the courts pry their cold dead fingers off them. Non-compete deals, like their mirror “at-will employment laws, which give companies the right to fire employees for no reason whatsoever except for a few specific situations, put all the power in employers’ hands. It’s not fair, and it’s not right. Workers deserve the right to get the best possible deal for their labor and some semblance of job security. Is that too much to ask for? It appears that in the United States, at least for now, it is. Related content news brief Canva raises prices by 320% for US customers A Teams subscription will cost $500 per year for five users.

    "commentBody": "Judge stops FTC from enforcing ban on non-compete agreements (computerworld.com)173 points by CrankyBear 16 hours agohidepastfavorite178 comments hansvm 13 hours agoI haven't yet seen an argument for non-competes that applied to non C-suites and wasn't already heavily covered by IP law. Is the problem at hand anything more than a cash grab from abusive employers? Back to the chevron thing though, how many of you have ever gotten a parking ticket? Imagine two years after the fact some bureaucrat sent a letter informing you that because of your previous bad decisions you're unable to drive. Driving is a privilege, and the state will no longer grant that privilege to you. Is that decision fair? You already went through the court system (or otherwise paid it off (implicitly, often explicitly, pleading guilty)), a judge took the time to judge your misdeeds, and you had some penalty applied, perhaps the max allowed by the law. Now though, some part of the executive branch wants to ignore any judicial action and assert their opinions. Even before this ludicrous supreme court case, that was a thing that happened. A whole office in Minnesota is dedicated to extra-judicial traffic rulings above and beyond what the judge thought was reasonable. I think it's wrong. Empower somebody like the FAA to make fast decisions when there are actually lives at stake, but everything else which could reasonably be judged one way or the other should go through somebody capable of judging it (maybe...a judge). Even FAA rulings probably ought to be vetted once they're less time sensitive. reply arcticbull 12 hours agoparent> Imagine two years after the fact some bureaucrat sent a letter informing you that because of your previous bad decisions you're unable to drive. Driving is a privilege, and the state will no longer grant that privilege to you. Ex post facto laws are generally unconstitutional. Generally -- especially as it imposes a new punishment after you've already been punished. Something like this would almost certainly be implemented as \"X driving infractions committed on or after [date law is effective].\" [edit] in administrative law, retroactive application is only permitted when congress has explicitly given retroactive power to an agency. reply olliej 12 hours agorootparentThis is not an ex post facto law - the question is purely \"are the terms of your contract enforceable?\". For example I can make a contract that has a term \"all people of gender/race/age X must be paid no more that 50% of the amount paid to people of gender/race/age Y\", but if I were to then sue a person that agreed to this contract they would immediately be able to say \"that term is not enforceable\". The FTC ruling on non-competes is no different - no one is saying \"a non-compete clause breaks the law in a way that would allow criminal or civil suits\", they are saying \"this clause is not enforceable\" (plenty of standard contract terms are not enforceable depending on state and/or country, and the unenforceable nature of the term does not - for better or worse - invalidate the entire contract). reply daft_pink 11 hours agoparentprevI don’t think this is really an argument for or against non-complete agreements in the United States. It’s basic United States separation of powers. If Congress passed a law eliminating or banning non-completes, then it would be legal. As an asdie, it seems that the Biden administration is positioning itself to overstep it’s authority with things it feels would be popular with specific voting blocks that will obviously be overturned by the courts and then position that the courts are too partisan. They are satisfied with how this works with voters even if the actual policies cannot actually be implmemented. I don’t think most serious observers felt this would make it through court review. reply hyeonwho4 11 hours agorootparentIn this case the US Congress has delegated to the FTC the power to regulate competition in interstate trade and markets. The relevant law is as follows: \" (1) Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful. (2) The Commission is hereby empowered and directed to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations, except banks, savings and loan institutions described in section 57a(f)(3) of this title, Federal credit unions described in section 57a(f)(4) of this title, common carriers subject to the Acts to regulate commerce, air carriers and foreign air carriers subject to part A of subtitle VII of title 49, and persons, partnerships, or corporations insofar as they are subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, as amended [7 U.S.C. 181 et seq.], except as provided in section 406(b) of said Act [7 U.S.C. 227(b)], from using unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\" The FTC has argued noncompetes constitute unfair or deceptive practices which affect commerce. The judge has disagreed. reply lumb63 8 hours agorootparentThe term “unfair” is extremely vague, and now (as it probably should be, IMO), laws are interpreted by the judiciary. If Congress wants a specific practice banned, then they can make a law to do so, rather than allowing unelected career bureaucrats to interpret the law as they see fit. reply tzs 7 hours agorootparent> If Congress wants a specific practice banned, then they can make a law to do so, rather than allowing unelected career bureaucrats to interpret the law as they see fit. As opposed to unelected judges who, unlike the bureaucrats, have lifetime appointments, almost no political oversight, and are very difficult to remove. The heads of federal agencies are appointed by the President and must be confirmed by the Senate and serve limited terms. reply kjksf 6 hours agorootparentWell, yes, because separation of powers. Congress makes the laws. Government (bureaucrats) enforces the law. Judges decide if government enforces the law correctly. The important part is not how bureaucrats or judges get their job but that bureaucrats were de facto creating laws exceeding their authority. Because the authority to create laws belongs to congress. It's not a perfect system but it would be even worse without separation of powers. reply consteval 2 hours agorootparentCongress already made the law. The law says \"these guys make the rules\". To me, that counts. The issue is that congress are not experts. They also move really, really slow. I don't expect my congressmen to know if Red 40 is safe to consume, how much can be consumed, if it should be reported as an ingredient, etc. There's thousands of ingredients in food, I imagine. If that was written into law the law would be very long, no? And then wouldn't it go out of date remarkably quickly? Hence, we have the FDA. They know about Red 40 and also medication. What level of specificity do we actually need here? Does Congress need to list out, specifically, what molecular compounds are and are not allowed? That seems absolutely absurd to me. It seems to me that once we get to the FTC or , suddenly the rules change and congress does need to be absurdly specific. Funny how that works. reply Hnrobert42 7 hours agorootparentprevIt seems you are using the term career bureaucrat as a pejorative. Often, they have far more expertise in the subject than career politicians. In any event, large decisions like this are made by political appointees appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. With Chevron overturned, we are now allowing unelected career judges interpreting policy however they see fit. If we were still in a world where precedent mattered and judges set their personal beliefs about policy aside and instead neutrally interpreted conformance with the law, sure. But as we now are packing the judiciary with partisans, it seems we've just substitutef one bad for another. reply throwup238 7 hours agorootparentUnelected career justices that make really dumb mistakes when it comes to basic facts: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/06/28/supreme... reply lumb63 4 hours agorootparentprevI don’t mean it as a pejorative - I agree that these folks are (often) experts in the area they’re working in. I mean only that the creation of laws does not belong to the bureaucracy, nor the interpretation of laws. Bureaucrats are also not as accountable to the voter (how many execute branch employees have been appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate?) as the legislature. I think that overturning Chevron should light a fire under the collective behinds of both parties in Congress to write more specific laws that legislate precisely. I am sure it will be mayhem for a while, unfortunately, as decades of laws will be interpreted by the courts for the first time, but in the end it should result in a structure that I believe conforms better to the intended structure (legislators legislate laws which are executed by the executive branch and whether or not those laws are upheld is judged by the judiciary). reply flanked-evergl 6 hours agorootparentprev> Often, they have far more expertise in the subject than career politicians. This is not relevant to their right to legislate or assume duties that the constitution has delegated to congress. reply consteval 2 hours agorootparentIt is relevant, because you require expertise to make rules. That seems fairly obvious to me but I suppose some segments of the political spectrum advocate blind rule making. > delegated to congress Right, and Congress has made that law, and that law says it's delegated to the FTC. What, Congress is simultaneously expected to make every single rule ever but they don't even have the rule making power to... delegate? That's too far? Seems absurd to me, almost intentionally insane with the end-goal of kneecapping rule making as a whole. reply daft_pink 4 hours agorootparentprevI understand your framing of this issue as judge vs FTC, but the reality is that delegation of authority the way this was written has never historically meant that they could create new laws, but simply that gave them the jurisdiction to enforce and create rules regarding existing laws related to unfair compeititon or deceptive business practices. Since the FTC can’t point to an existing law that makes non-compete contracts illegal, it lacks the power to unilaterally declare them illegal. Most observers didn’t think that this rule would pass court scrutiny. reply runarberg 2 hours agorootparentI feel like this framing is extremely convenient and ignores how things work in other aspects of when congress delegates power to a specialized committee. For example, OSHA doesn’t need to find a specific law to deem a certain work practice unsafe and prohibit it, FDA doesn’t need to find a law against arsenic poisoning to take unsafe food product of the market, and the TSA doesn’t need a law against liquids in an airplane before they prohibit passengers from taking them onto the flight. In every other instance what is required is that experts in the field back up their reasons with adequate research. In this case the FTC has done that, they have argued that non-compete is an unfair practice and shouldn’t be allowed, just like the NHTSA has argued that Airbags are an important enough safety feature that all new cars should be required to have it. Both have plenty enough research to back up their claims, but only the FTC needs a specific law? I wonder why that is. reply foobarkey 10 hours agoprevIn Europe if you want to force a non-compete you need to pay full salary for the duration, so if someone enforced non compete for 5 years I could sit home and play games while earning salary reply theshrike79 10 hours agoparentAFAIK this is only valid if the non-compete effectively prevents you from working in your profession. Which is most of the time, granted. reply brightball 10 hours agorootparentI was told by an attorney years ago that non-competes were only enforceable if they had a reasonably defined scope and specifically were unenforceable in Right to Work states if it effectively prevented you from working at all. Reasonable scope was something like max 2 years, specific distance from current office that wasn’t excessive (couple of miles) or had specifics about taking existing customers. reply theshrike79 10 hours agorootparentYea, the previous employer needs to prove that your knowledge of their internals will harm them financially. And you, of course, need to not be an ass and start poaching clients with insider information =) reply matwood 7 hours agorootparentprevSame. The biggest issue with non-competes is the intimidation factor. People are scared to challenge them even though without proper compensation and scope they are basically worthless. Few if any judges will prevent someone from making a living. I also think they are mostly fine in the cases where they are properly constructed (compensation and scope). reply LunaSea 10 hours agoparentprevThis is incorrect.

Do you understand what you're advocating for? You're advocating for literal lawlessness. For anarchy. For giving the government absolute power. Given that government abuses non-absolute power you can bet that when they get absolute power it'll take about a second to turn any country into Putin's Russia. reply advael 46 minutes agorootparentAnd you're saying that other states affected by these decisions should have no recourse for judicial activism that happens in some gerrymandered area that happened to get a judge appointed. The alternative to that isn't lawlessness, it's mitigating a vulnerability in the separation of powers, and I think our eye should be toward patching that vulnerability.

The plaintiff will have to make the case. reply willcipriano 7 hours agoparentprevMost non competes are signed on your first day of work after you quit your previous job (under duress) and provide no consideration. Basic contract law should have thrown these out long ago. reply flanked-evergl 7 hours agorootparentIn my experience, \"non competes\" form part of an employment contract, as a clause of the employment contract, and are not an entirely separate contract. In contract law, the requirement for consideration applies to the contract as a whole, not to each individual clause. An employment contract, as a whole, definitionally provides consideration. Can you give some examples where \"non competes\" are signed independently of your employment contracts without consideration? The quoted article refers to them as clauses, and the FTC rule in question is also titled the \"Non-Compete Clause Rule\" [1]. [1] https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/07/2024-09... reply willcipriano 5 hours agorootparentI've never had a real employment contract. Most Americans haven't. It's typically at will employment. Every job I've had is as I've described. First day you go into HR to do your W2, set up insurance, 401K, etc and then you are also handed a surprise non complete. Don't want to sign it? No job. If it was part of the employment contract you'd be aware of it during the negotiations. Since you haven't even seen the paperwork until this point, how could you have proper consideration for it rolled up in the employment agreement? Why is it even a separate document if that is the case? reply flanked-evergl 5 hours agorootparentIn this case, it sounds like the non-compete is a clause to an implied contract then. And every single employment contract I have signed had a non-compete that was not mentioned during negotiation, and in every single case the non-competes could not be negotiated away either — that does not mean they have no consideration. > Since you haven't even seen the paperwork until this point, how could you have proper consideration for it rolled up in the employment agreement? You are using the word consideration in two different senses (i.e. equivocating in the technical sense) [1][2]. A contract must have consideration, but the consideration it requires is consideration in the sense of \"A payment or other recompense for something done\" not \"The thought process of considering, of taking multiple or specified factors into account (with of being the main corresponding adposition)\". If you want consideration in the second sense here, just refuse to sign the clause until you have sufficiently considered it. But if you do sign it, it does not mean it's without consideration in the first sense here.

That won't hold up anywhere. > refuse to sign the clause until you have sufficiently considered Sure, but you just told me to quit my job and sent me an offer letter with your terms and \"forgot\" that not working for X years unpaid after I leave is one of them. In fact you probably did the opposite, you called it \"at will\" when it clearly isn't, for me at least. Perhaps you don't sign and sue for promissory estoppel? Wouldn't it be simpler for employers to just define this sort of thing at the start instead of being sneaky about it? reply flanked-evergl 5 hours agorootparent> Implied contracts aren't worth the paper they aren't written on. That won't hold up anywhere. Okay, problem solved then. You don't have a non-compete clause because it won't hold up anywhere. Still has no bearing whether your contract and its clauses have consideration. > Perhaps you don't sign and sue for promissory estoppel? Sure. Good luck. reply willcipriano 5 hours agorootparentThey aren't implied. They are physical documents presented and signed after the 'employment contract' has already began to be executed. Hell that 'employment contract' is at will 99% of the time, any party can end it at point for any reason, but that doesn't apply to the implied non-compete portion signed after employment? What? It's nonsense all the way down. reply flanked-evergl 4 hours agorootparentIf you sign a non-compete clause in the context of employment, even at will employment, the continued employment can serve as consideration for the clause. It's not without consideration.

In today's political landscape with a democratic administration, it's unsurprising that courts in conservative districts frequently rule against federal agencies. Notably this judge was appointed by Trump, and is citing recent rulings and legal theory from the current radically conservative Supreme Court. Judges in liberal areas are still under some obligation to take precedent into account, so the case may have gone the same way even with a liberal judge, now that the Chevron Doctrine is more or less dead due to the Supreme Court.

Agencies will just write whatever they want, enforce it, then after have the legal system involved. At that point the damage is done. Lets try to get closer to laws and rules that have some semblance of representation, even if its not “perfect” yet. reply dangus 13 hours agorootparentTechnically the president who handles a lot of agency appointments and guidance is elected somewhat more democratically than the senate, who confirms federal judges. At least the electoral college roughly takes state population into account. The senate just assigns two senators to states with 580,000 people and then does the exact same for states with 38 million people. reply quartesixte 11 hours agorootparentSenators were designed as senior statesmen representing the interest of State Governments, and as a check against the popularly-elected Representatives in the House so that the smaller states could have a voice. That's why general public couldn't even vote for senators until the 17th amendment in 1913. I wonder from time to time the ramifications of turning Senators into basically super-representatives. I think it's always good to keep in mind that the Founders and Framers really did consider the individual States as semi-autonomous entities bound together in a tight FEDERATION that would cooperate on interstate commerce, mutual defense, and foreign diplomacy. And so, Wyoming, Maine and Rhode Island get just as many senators as New York, Texas, and California because they are just as important to this Union as any other state. Edit: Apparently (but not surprisingly) there is some partisanship surrounding this issue and I want to make clear that 1) I came to this thought via just some first-principles thinking 2) I do sympathize with the motivations behind the 17th and the challenges of reverting to pre-17th (in the same way we really can't go back to pre-12th Amendment style POTUS elections). reply dangus 40 minutes agorootparentYou said that each state has equal importance to the union, right? So what would you say if California had a state vote and decided to split into 5 states. There would be states for the LA, Bay Area, San Diego, Sacramento, and a 5th state for all the other areas. California would gain 8 new senators just by dividing its boundaries, and it would probably all be the same political party. Or the same for Wyoming. Why not Wyoming just declare that it is now 4 states and quadruple its representation? See the problem here? This assignment of senators is arbitrary and has nothing to do with representing states. States aren’t people. This system isn’t really designed with the incentives or guard rails to do what you say it does. There’s nothing that requires a senator to be this image of a dignified senior statesperson that represents the interests of the state in the way that the founders imagined. Case in point: JD Vance became a senator with zero public service experience. He has no longstanding relationship with state congresspeople in Ohio. The founders made the constitution in a time before our advanced financial and media landscape. It was also conceived at a time when states were barely even agreeing to be united into a single country. It was also made at a time before mass urbanization. With all this context in mind I can’t really see what the Senate’s purpose is besides disenfranchising voters in larger states. Congress isn’t really there to make sure that smaller states are satisfied, it’s there to pass federal laws in areas where the federal government has authority over states. It’s not even legally allowed for a state to secede. So why are the needs of arbitrary state boundaries more important than those of the people? I would argue that the founders might have been wrong to decide that we need a check on the desires of voters. They were clearly wrong on the electoral college, which should just go away entirely or at least change to a more granular system like the states that split their electoral votes. I would say that the best thing we could do is expand the House of Representatives to around 2,000 representatives and then eliminate the senate entirely. Or, perhaps, turn the senate into a subcommittee of more tenured representatives elected by members of the House of Representatives. reply ClumsyPilot 10 hours agorootparentprev> first-principles thinking What does this mean?

It's chaos. Neuter the executive branch and the game is up: no promises get delivered on and therefore no world-ending stakes can be played up in the presidential election cycle.

And today the LDP party leader election stems from a leaderless leader (Kishida) failing to both lead his country (stagnant economy and policies) and manage his party (politicians from mere Parliament members to cabinet ministers engaging in literal tax evasion).

IMO the administrative state is a unique little corner of meritocracy in a political system that is full of bad incentives. Congresspeople use donor money to get elected and are incentivized to listen non-constituents with the biggest pocketbooks. The president is elected by the people in similar big money elections with primaries controlled by the political party apparatus. The judicial branch is appointed by the rest of that system, which is not surprising since they’re the ones that made dark money campaign contributions illegal via the citizens united ruling. The administrative state is the only place where people actually get into their position on their merit and suitability for the job alone. Everyone below a certain level isn’t a political appointee, they’re hired off a job board based on their accomplishments and proficiencies like everyone else.

Sometimes even tax deductible? reply monero-xmr 14 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is there is a lack of compromise in the legislature so each side wants quick fixes. Government is slow, so the executive has responded to their voters by trying to assert more power, often a layer removed via regulatory agencies. I would like to see Congress pass more laws, which requires compromise. You can look at the federal government over decades, things don't happen over months or a few years, things are slow. If the issue surfaces over a few voting cycles then some things will pass, often as riders on big must-pass bills, or giant omnibus bills like the Inflation Reduct Act which had all manner of things attached to it. In general I don't want singular agencies making economy-wide changes, nor the executive to do things by fiat. I agree with banning non-competes in principle but if you let such massive economic changes pass that way, then get prepared for all manner of things you disagree with passing the same way.

For example, the left complained when the trump admin tried to make it easier to fire civil servants and replace them with political appointees. The left has an extremely consistent view of the administrative state. They want it to exist as a quasi-fourth branch where the president doesn’t have full authority to turn those agencies into an embodiment of their personal will. The left views the administrative state as an additional check on certain areas where our three branches fall short on managing a complex array of the day to day operation of the country.

Yes, and many people don't want the administrative state to exist as a quasi-fourth branch. As someone who now runs a business with multiple lines of business in heavily regulated areas, you basically have three problems. First, what does the regulator think the law says. Second, what administrative actions has a regulator occupying the position previously done. Third, what does the law actually say. The administrative state has very real issues between the first and second points. In particular, the ability for an executive to do things like \"imply\" greater investigative actions may be taken for engaging in certain lines of business effectively means that laws can be selectively reinterpreted to achieve political aims. An obvious example of this is Operation Choke Point from the Obama presidency. To this day, it makes obtaining MSB bank accounts for handling things as simple as payroll quite difficult.

Why not? Congress has the authority to pass the laws it sees fit. Why is it suddenly a problem that Congress passed a law that says \"the agency known as the Federal Trade Commission is established and the President, through a set of commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, shall ensure that the these list of goals are accomplished and shall establish such rules as the Commission deems appropriate.\" We aren't a parliamentary system. The Congress has the power of the purse and the power to enact laws. The President has the power to implement the laws and to spend the money.

If they pay me for the years I can’t work after resigning, I would very much say no. If they don’t pay me for those years, I would say it could be seen as being unfair. But the rule is a blanket ban on all noncompetes essentially, even for senior executives! (Unless I’m reading it wrong.)

You won't become business-owner rich just by coming up with the right concept, but you can have a successful research career, get enough funding to run a small research group, win a Nobel/etc prize... etc. But that says more about how our society and economy are organized than it does about the inherent value of ideas qua ideas. reply infinite8s 4 minutes agorootparentprevI don't think he's trying to be rich (except maybe to provide self-funding for his research). reply jacobolus 14 minutes agorootparentprevIt's pretty hard for one person or even one small team to both (a) do advanced green-field research in whichever uncertain direction they feel most exited to explore, and (b) make a complete and polished saleable product which best meets the needs of a well-defined set of customers. The skills, personalities, organizing principles, and methods involved are substantially different, and focusing on making a product has a tendency to cut off many conceptually valuable lines of inquiry based on financial motivations. Notice that Bret Victor's goal (like most researchers) is not to become as rich as possible.

At Dynamicland, each version of a program is a sheet of paper (with a unique set of fiducials along the edges). If you want to edit a program, you grab a keyboard and point it at the program. A text editor comes up; you make your changes, and hit commit. When you do, it spits out a new piece of paper with your changes. Put it in the view of the camera to use the new version. Take it away and use the old paper to roll the change back. reply breck 16 minutes agoparent> with a unique set of fiducials along the edges I suspect each piece of paper, if examined with a good enough camera, has a unique fingerprint, like a snowflake, and perhaps this could be used in the future for an \"Isomer Addressed Filesystem\". In other words, all pieces of paper ship with a UUID already, woven into their atoms. reply reaperman 47 minutes agoprevI assume this hasn't been \"released\" yet, but still thought I'd ask if the source code for the operating system (or \"computing environment\", in Dynamicland-speak) is available anywhere and also if there yet exists any DIY hardware guides for building your own to play with at my own location (far from the Oakland/Berkeley Dynamicland facility). I believe the FAQ confirms that this is not possible at the moment: > Where can I get Realtalk? >> At present, Realtalk exists in Dynamicland spaces and in the spaces of our collaborators, where we can carefully grow and tend in-person communities of practice. In the short term, additional spaces will be started by people who have contributed significantly to an existing space and have internalized the culture and its values. Long term, we intend to distribute the ideas in the form of kits+games which will guide communities through building their own computing environments that they fully understand and control. Long long term, computing may be built into all infrastructure as electric light is today. This would also require an extensive network of educational support. reply asolove 38 minutes agoparentThere are some similar-ish systems with alpha-level install instructions: https://folk.computer/pilot reply dingnuts 29 minutes agoparentprev>In the short term, additional spaces will be started by people who have contributed significantly to an existing space and have internalized the culture and its values there's something ominous, weird, and sort of damning about being protective of your \"culture and values\" in this way and to this extent. If Dynamicland offered a truly novel computing paradigm, it should be one that is accessible by other cultures. If it offers a valuable culture and worthwhile values, those values should be viral on their merits. They should be broadcast, rather than kept closely guarded. If you have to carefully indoctrinate new users into your culture in order to protect it and keep out the Others who might ruin your culture with wrongthink, maybe what you actually have is a cult. reply azeirah 19 minutes agorootparentYes-ish, I somewhat agree with your critique. I think it's a temporary measure though. It is very America-centric and that's very sad to me. I think Bret is a bit hesitant to share the stuff before people understand what it is, to prevent the same problem that happened when Jobs visited PARC and walked away with the idea of \"we need to build computers with the desktop metaphor\", without understanding at all that it was always meant to be about authoring and sharing, not about the visual metaphors. Regardless, I hope to see more actual standalone instances/offshoots of dynamicland. reply Juliate 20 minutes agorootparentprev> there's something [...] about being protective of your \"culture and values\" in this way and to this extent Yes, AND it may also be because it's kind of innovation in the open, before it's really ready or that all the critical angles are fixed, and they might not want spoil specifics they would like to make flourish and present to the whole world, and see them ... let's say half-assed, or misunderstood enough that it does not \"jell\".

Big talk about solving the worlds problems out in the room and not on the phone I agree with in sentiment but I feel all that big talk falls completely flat on it's face when the project you're pouring money and most importantly time only exists in one space and only benefits a small group of academics and then that issue being gushed over as if its a benefit when really it just means you're not actually building in the real world at all you're building a fake thing in a fake world for the 0.01% of people to larp with. Think the world of computing could greatly benefit from Brett but almost in his success it means he'll just be able to play pretend in the world of \"non-profit\"/academia meaning the output will be citations + grants not value and there will be no real benefit to computing from that work. Maybe I'd feel different if the intro video ended with a repo and a list of hardware to build your own Dynamicland, I almost think the fact it doesn't is a tactic for the project to never have to really prove its value... reply gffrd 1 hour agoprevI love the ambitions and values in this work: that programs are physical so are shared and discoverable, that things are learnable through play, that the goal is people together.

Always inspiring, always a gut check if I'm doing work that's valuable. reply abeppu 20 minutes agoprevI think the overall idea here is really cool. But ... to me the idea of printing stanzas of code onto paper and then putting them on a board so they can be OCRed back into text and then re-parsed seems circuitous. Like as a demonstration that in principle you can work this way on code as well as on more spatially-native concepts, it seems fine, but is that actually the best way for all kinds of work? Or can we acknowledge that this makes more sense for some things than for others? reply bsimpson 18 minutes agoparentIt's not OCR. Those colored dots along the periphery are fiducials. They're how Realtalk recognizes a program. Every object that you can interact with in Realtalk has a unique set of fiducials.

However, the fact that there is still code written on pieces of paper, and that the projector can only show a 2D image (which is only primitively interactable) just looks super awkward. and the question of \"what can you do\" when you're staring at a blank table seems tough again, it's super cool research but i wonder if he has plans to resolve some of these fundamental issues with mixing real and virtual reply skadamat 56 minutes agoparentIMO the goal here isn't to replace traditional software engineering.

I do believe physical embodiment of computers is the future and the current screen/GUI paradigm will decline, but the embodiment will be different. The physically embodied computer of the future will be a humanoid robot, and we will interact with it the same way we do with humans: by gesturing and speaking. There will always be a place for screens, just as there is still a place for books, but we will have less reason to use them when we can accomplish what we want to do in more natural collaboration with physically embodied computers in the form of humanoid robots, alongside other humans. reply azeirah 42 minutes agoparentDespite appearances, dynamicland isn't about any particular paradigm on its own. It's a set of values and a way of looking at media that come together to create computer-literate communities and even culture. This is obviously a bit vague, especially if you look at all the things they're doing with the cameras and the projectors and the dots and all that. There's nothing stopping anyone \"running\" dynamicland on anything else. It's a completely different way of looking at computers, and it's basically saying \"monitors, keyboards, mice, projectors, smartphones, tablets, laptops, vr headsets and xr headsets are all different kinds of ways to experience computation in the flesh. We want to explore what happens when we change the fundamental assumptions that computing is something you do (alone) in front of 'a computer'. What could computing look like if it was reimagined from the ground up, and we used people instead of person as our target audience, space instead of product, extensions of existing media rather than inventing new media, literacy instead of profession\". It's difficult to really explain in one go, I've been following Bret Victor since before he even started ok CDG Regardless, I think it's the future for precisely one reason; it's easier, cheaper and more powerful.

    "originBody": "Posts unix.foo Posts Menu The Insecurity of Debian. In June of 2023 Red Hat made a controversial decision to change how they distribute the source code behind Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). There have been a lot of keyboards tapped angrily across social media that left many uncertain about the ramifications of the decision. There were many questions about the future viability of downstream rebuilds of RHEL affecting distributions like Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Oracle Linux, and others. Each have since made announcements to try and calm their communities. Still. Many in the open source community have interpreted Red Hat’s decision for what it really was: A dick move. There has been a steady uptick of people stating that they will migrate (or already have) to Debian – seeking refuge from what they see as greedy corporate influence. I understand the sentiment fully. However, there’s a problem here that I want to talk about: security. The ugly truth is that security is hard. It’s tedious. Unpleasant. And requires a lot of work to get right. Debian does not do enough here to protect users. Long ago, Red Hat embraced the usage of SELinux. And they took it beyond just enabling the feature in their kernel. They put in the arduous work of crafting default SELinux policies for their distribution. These policies ship enabled by default in their distribution. The policies help protect a variety of daemons that run by default on RHEL, as well as many of the most popular daemons folks tend to use on the server. Apache, nginx, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, OpenSSH, etc. are all covered by SELinux policies that ship on RHEL distributions. The protection even extends to containers. Containers are increasingly the preferred method for developers to deploy their software – myself included. A common misconception is that if you run something in a container, it’s inherently secure. This is absolutely not true. Containers by themselves do not solve a security problem. They solve a software distribution problem. They give a false impression of security to those that run them. On Red Hat based distributions, you can use a drop-in Docker alternative named podman which allows you to run containers without needing a daemon (unlike Docker) and it provides other benefits like being able to run fully root-less. But Red Hat takes it a step further here and applies strong default SELinux policies that separate the container from the host OS and even from other containers! There have been numerous examples of being able to escape from a container and touch the host OS or other containers. This is where tools like SELinux step in. The application of SELinux policies on a container allows for a hardened sarcophagus to place your application in which mitigates the risk of unknown future exploits. And it’s nearly effortless to use on RHEL. Red Hat was aware that unless they put in the work on these default policies, their users would simply not embrace the technology and millions of servers would remain vulnerable. Because let’s be real here. SELinux is hard. The policy language and tooling is cumbersome, obtuse, and is about as appealing as filling out tax forms. It frankly sucks to use – if you are manually creating your own policies that is. But due to the work Red Hat has put in, the usage of SELinux on RHEL is mostly transparent and provides real security benefits to their users. Debian’s Approach Debian, a stalwart of the open-source community, is revered for its stability and extensive software library. I am a fan and donate to the project every year (you should too!) even though I don’t run it in production environments. However, its default security framework leaves much to be desired. Debian’s decision to enable AppArmor by default starting with version 10 signifies a positive step towards improved security, yet it falls short due to the half-baked implementation across the system. Debian’s reliance on AppArmor and its default configurations reveals a systemic issue with its approach to security. While AppArmor is capable of providing robust security when properly configured, Debian’s out-of-the-box settings fail to leverage its full potential: Limited Default Profiles: Debian ships with a minimal set of AppArmor profiles, leaving many critical services unprotected. Reactive vs. Proactive Stance: Debian’s security model often relies on users to implement stricter policies, rather than providing a secure-by-default configuration. Inconsistent Application: Unlike SELinux in Red Hat systems, which applies to the entire system consistently, AppArmor in Debian is applied piecemeal, leading to potential security gaps. Lack of Resources: Debian as a community-driven project lacks the resources to develop and maintain comprehensive security policies comparable to those provided by Red Hat. It’s very common for folks to run container workloads on Debian via Docker – which does automatically generate and load a default AppArmor profile for containers named docker-default. Unfortunately, it’s not a very strong profile for security and is overly permissive. This profile, while providing some protection, leaves significant attack surfaces exposed. For instance: network, capability, file, umount, # Host (privileged) processes may send signals to container processes. signal (receive) peer=unconfined, # runc may send signals to container processes (for \"docker stop\"). signal (receive) peer=runc, # crun may send signals to container processes (for \"docker stop\" when used with crun OCI runtime). signal (receive) peer=crun, # dockerd may send signals to container processes (for \"docker kill\"). signal (receive) peer={{.DaemonProfile}}, # Container processes may send signals amongst themselves. signal (send,receive) peer={{.Name}}, deny @{PROC}/* w, # deny write for all files directly in /proc (not in a subdir) # deny write to files not in /proc//** or /proc/sys/** deny @{PROC}/{[^1-9],[^1-9][^0-9],[^1-9s][^0-9y][^0-9s],[^1-9][^0-9][^0-9][^0-9/]*}/** w, deny @{PROC}/sys/[^k]** w, # deny /proc/sys except /proc/sys/k* (effectively /proc/sys/kernel) deny @{PROC}/sys/kernel/{?,??,[^s][^h][^m]**} w, # deny everything except shm* in /proc/sys/kernel/ deny @{PROC}/sysrq-trigger rwklx, deny @{PROC}/kcore rwklx, deny mount, deny /sys/[^f]*/** wklx, deny /sys/f[^s]*/** wklx, deny /sys/fs/[^c]*/** wklx, deny /sys/fs/c[^g]*/** wklx, deny /sys/fs/cg[^r]*/** wklx, deny /sys/firmware/** rwklx, deny /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/** rwklx, deny /sys/kernel/security/** rwklx, The network rule allows all network-related syscalls without restriction. The capability rule, without specific denials, permits most capabilities by default. The file rule grants broad file access permissions, relying on specific deny rules for protection. AppArmor vs. SELinux The fundamental difference between AppArmor and SELinux lies in their approach to Mandatory Access Control (MAC). AppArmor operates on a path-based model, while SELinux employs a significantly more complex type enforcement system. This distinction becomes particularly evident in container environments. SELinux applies a type to every object in the system - files, processes, ports, you name it. When you launch a container on a SELinux-enabled RHEL system, it’s immediately assigned the container_t type – a strict access control mechanism. The container_t type effectively cordons off the container, preventing it from interacting with any object not explicitly labeled for container use. But SELinux doesn’t stop at type enforcement. It takes container isolation a step further with Multi-Category Security (MCS) labels. These labels function as an additional layer of segregation, ensuring that even containers of the same type (container_t) remain isolated from each other. Each container gets its own unique MCS label, creating what amounts to a private sandbox within the broader container_t environment. AppArmor, in contrast, doesn’t concern itself with types or categories. It focuses on limiting the capabilities of specific programs based on pre-defined profiles. These profiles specify which files a program can access and which operations it can perform. While this approach is more straightforward to implement and understand, it lacks the granularity and system-wide consistency of SELinux’s type enforcement. Almost no mainstream Linux distribution distributes comprehensive AppArmor profiles for all common network-facing daemons by default. The practical implications of these differences are significant. In a SELinux environment, a compromised container faces substantial hurdles in accessing or affecting the host system or other containers, thanks to the dual barriers of type enforcement and MCS labels. This isn’t to say one is universally superior to the other. SELinux offers more robust isolation but at the cost of increased complexity and potential performance overhead. AppArmor provides a simpler, more approachable security model that can still be quite effective when configured properly. The root of my point though is that Red Hat has put in the work here to make the use of SELinux and containers seamless and easy for its users. You aren’t left to fend for yourself. In the end, the choice between Debian and Red Hat isn’t just about corporate influence versus community-driven development. It’s also a choice between a system that assumes the best and one that prepares for the worst. Unfortunately in today’s highly connected world, pessimism is a necessity.",

Yes, people/sysadmins should take their time to properly configure SELinux when things don't work, instead of just disabling it completely for good. I tried for a whole year in a place where we used CentOS, and then finally I gave up, too many hours wasted in finding the right conf for this new program or configurations etc. reply Spivak 2 hours agorootparentI feel like I'm taking crazy pills in this thread. SELinux is so easy to set up in anything RHEL 7+. Everything from the distro works ootb, the auditor will tell you exactly what caused the error, it will give you the commands to fix it, and you can label programs you don't want to deal with with unconfined_t. There's no reason to completely disable it, you lose all the benefit of all the software Red Hat engineers have already made work with it. reply drewlander 3 minutes agorootparentI agree. I have worked at various companies that use Red Hat/CentOS extensively and the only time I ever saw someone turn Selinux off was on RHEL 6. Ever since then, it has been easier and easier to use. Not saying it is perfect for everyone, but it does work and can be made to work well. reply generalizations 10 minutes agorootparentprevHave you ever read the commands the auditor gives you? They can be laughably broad, barely short of just giving the app unconfined permissions. If you're just blindly copy-pasting what it tells you, you might as well just disable it. reply aarmenaa 12 minutes agorootparentprevThe documentation is atrocious, and usually won't say things like \"label your program unconfined_t\" because they don't want you to do that ever. Also, tutorials -- even RedHat's -- are always some variation of \"here's how to use audit2allow.\" That is very much not what I want. I want to create a reusable policy that I can apply to many hosts via Ansible or as part of an RPM package I created. I've never been able to figure out how to do that because it is always drowned out by SEO spam that barely scratches the surface of practical usage. It's painfully obvious to me that the people who create SELinux and its documentation live in some alternate universe where they don't do anything the way I do, so I just turn it off. reply darkwater 1 hour agorootparentprev(this was in 2016) Yes, usually the logs pointed you in the right direction, but it still made things more complicated and trick the \"lazy attitude\" in many people (or, at least, in me). reply IshKebab 20 minutes agorootparentprevYou must have been extremely lucky because I've had multiple apps just trigger endless SELinux warnings on RHEL8 (Rustdesk is an example) and I very much subscribe to the views in this article: https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/selinux-unmanageable.html I'm not going to waste my time fighting SELinux to stop non-existent threats (I'm just using a desktop and I'm not a high profile target). Too many false positives and I'll just turn it off. And in my experience there are always too many false positives. reply AnonCoward42 1 hour agorootparentprevI keep SELinux enabled at all times, but it does break quite often. For the sake of sticking to Fedora, wg-quick (wireguard) does not work out of the box. On OpenSUSE/MicroOS who is employing SELinux boot takes about 5 minutes on every kernel change, because of home-relabel. I hear you, that they probably do it wrong, but that's what you get with SELinux. Not enough to push me to disable SELinux, but maybe to avoid SELinux distributions in the future. reply EvanAnderson 2 hours agoparentprevI always pushed back hard on vendors who wanted me to disable SELinux on my RHEL boxes. It's unacceptable to disable default OS security protections to make an application function.

Root can still be confined under SELinux with a good policy. reply cvhc 33 minutes agoparentprevI just feel SELinux would add too much burden to sysadmins. I use CentOS + SELinux in one of my VPS and it's already painful. I've been sysadmin in university labs for some years. I did what I think is reasonable, setup a firewall, limit root access, never trust lab servers to the extent that I forward my SSH agent on it... But I don't want users come to me every time they want to run a custom / proprietary program and I spend time writing and debugging MAC rules. And I don't agree with the article that containers do not add security. Container runtime implements namespace isolation, seccomp filters, etc. and that reduce the attack surface, comparing to running the software directly on the host OS. More importantly in this discussion, it is convenient for sysadmins. There is no perfect security anyway. And I don't sacrifice convenience for national security level security :) reply giancarlostoro 3 hours agoparentprevThis reminds me of my college years and the one time we used Fedora and someone accidentally set it up with SELinux, we spent hours pulling our hairs out trying to figure out why nothing worked. Only to finally realize SELinux was the culprit and we needed to turn it off. reply mhitza 3 hours agorootparentSELinux has been enabled on Fedora for as long as I remember. SELinux is complex, badly documented, policy code is obscure macro incantation, and basic debugging tools often aren't installed out of the box on server distros (such as audit2allow). But for the day to day administration of systems, policies are included for distribution packages and most issues can be fixed by enabling a boolean here and there, and relabeling files. The principles, basic admin & debugging part can be learned in a couple of hours, and when you have custom service software, you can throw it in /opt and have it run unconfined (ie: not subject to SELinux rules). reply jerf 2 hours agorootparent\"The principles, basic admin & debugging part can be learned in a couple of hours,\" In principle, yes.

It seems like this is getting worse as the search engines continue their trend of taking your query as a vague suggestion of the sort of thing you're looking for.) reply mhitza 2 hours agorootparentMaybe I'll write that guide, and then (fingers crossed) people will find it via search engines (before all search engines become just an LLM frontend). reply jerf 1 hour agorootparentWell, if you do, my email is in my profile and I'll be happy to be an advance proofreader if you're interested. I've got a couple of teens in a very similar position as well, so I can even provide multiple people's point of view. I have pretty much the exact right amount of experience for that; I've been in there, I've done things, even completed a couple of non-trivial projects (nothing amazing, but, more than just \"a pad with a pocket in it\"), I recognize I'm confused, I don't know where to proceed from there. reply XorNot 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's baffling to me that SELinux's UI is like...the best we can apparently do? The underlying concepts of SELinux aren't so hard but trying to manage it in any sort of coherent way is a nightmare - up to and including the provisions in it for a network based policy server component which just never appeared. And it sucks! In theory it does so many things we really really want, and should do more. Like I as a user have a great interest in ensuring my home directory files follow sensible markings based on their content - my SSH keys, AWS keys, or banking files all exist in different logical zones of control. And this is a concept SELinux can handle...but the tools are just so bad at surfacing it. reply mike_hearn 6 minutes agorootparentIt's not. The (undocumented!)

Also, SELinux can give you a false sense of security. It's best to harden the system overall instead of relying on one security feature (however good it might be). reply Spivak 2 hours agorootparentYes, and SELinux is by far the most powerful tool that exists for hardening your system overall. Why would you skip it? reply speckx 2 hours agorootparentprevThis has worked for me in the past, but it's not something anyone should do in production. ;) Then again, Disabling SELinux is necessary. For example, cPanel requires disabling SELinux on CentOS, AlmaLinux OS, CloudLinux, and Rocky Linux. AppArmor is fine on Ubuntu (https://docs.cpanel.net/installation-guide/system-requiremen...). reply rurban 1 hour agorootparentIt's not necessary, it's a stupid dick move. cPanel was just not capable to tune the selinux profiles for their services, I've worked there.

When I ran into issues the logs often come with a solution. reply candiddevmike 3 hours agoparentprevIMO, it's because relying on filesystem labels and compiled policies (SELinux) ended up being a poor design choice vs defining the access in easy to understand policy files (AppArmor). reply nicce 3 hours agorootparentAppArmor is easier to understand because it is simply less restrictive, and in that way it is less effective solution. I would not call SELinux as poor design choice because of that. You can't do things with AppArmor that you can with SELinux. reply generalizations 3 hours agorootparentYou can make your security as granular as you like; but it's just like any other architecture in that you have to come up with good abstractions that make it usable. SElinux is simply poorly designed. reply miah_ 2 hours agorootparentIts because Selinux wasn't really designed for \"sysadmins\" it was designed for \"governments\" or organizations that need to meet a specific level of security as a contractual/legal requirement. Selinux came out of the NSA and is based around the Trusted Systems Criteria / Common Criteria, aka the Rainbow Books. If you look at 'Trusted Solaris' (or IRIX, AIX) you'll see very similar systems. Is this poor design or simply, not designed _for_you_? I agree, its a royal pain to manage, and it might be overkill for a small shop trying to lock down their web server. Thankfully there are other solutions, and operating systems that may better fit your use cases. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Criteria https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Solaris https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux reply taikobo 18 minutes agorootparentWell put, so to rephrase: SELinux is not for most people and cooperation, therefore, it is sensible to just disable it, making RHEL less secure than Debian in practice. reply generalizations 24 minutes agorootparentprevI mean yeah. It's software designed for compliance. It's technically capable of any kind of restriction a bureaucrat might envision, so it's the best thing available for the kind of checkbox security needed in a regulated industry. I find it enlightening to read what kinds of justifications the proponents of SElinux use. It's never about the quality of the software; it's about how there's more band-aid tooling to make it easier to work with, or about how it's not as bad as it was, or that it gives you all these knobs and levers to have more control. It's not what you focus on when you're serious about quality software engineering. Imagine if we were talking about something like Gnome or the Windows 11 interface: yeah, the interface is a real pain to navigate, but we added even more menus and buttons and the rightclick menu is twice as long now, so you can do even more stuff with it, and we even added Clippy back in to help you when you get stuck! reply okasaki 2 hours agorootparentprevPoorly designed for general use? reply commandersaki 2 hours agorootparentprevAnd if you want to see something that is the pinnacle of design in this space, go no further than openbsd pledge and unveil.

Yes, SELinux is more capable, at the cost of additional complexity. I think it's debatable how many companies need that complexity, especially outside of the federal space. reply vundercind 3 hours agorootparentI’d bet money the main practical purpose SELinux serves is to check boxes when negotiating government contracts, in a way that’s familiar and can be called a standard. Then in practice someone ends up writing a couple policy statements and filing a couple forms then disabling it anyway, nearly every time. If that’s the case it doesn’t need to actually work in practice, just hypothetically. reply NewJazz 2 hours agorootparentprevCan you offer some examples of things you can restrict with SELinux that you wouldn't be able to with AppArmor? reply mhitza 0 minutes agorootparentLimiting services to a limited set of ports, if this forum post is still relevant today https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1780657 Regarding how to do that, it's left as an exercise to the PhD holding student. goneri 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is one of the topics of the article. reply vlovich123 2 hours agorootparentHaving read the article I could not find any example of what is impossible in AppArmor, just a statement repeated in various ways that SELinux is easier to provide a secure-by-default environment with the closest thing to justification being that SELinux models things with types whereas app armor deals with restrictions on specific applications. I’m sure this all makes sense to someone already well-versed in the space, but I’m left with the same question as OP. reply NewJazz 1 hour agorootparentprevYou mean the mention of MCS labels?

For this reason, it's best to disallow hard linking when using AppArmor, while such a restriction is unnecessary under SELinux. reply turtle_heck 35 minutes agoparentprevEvery RHEL server we ever provisioned (dev, testing, prod, vm, physical, etc) had it enabled, everyone who blindly disables it is lazy. reply bluedino 2 hours agoparentprevExact opposite here, all the RHEL shops I've worked at were required to have SELinux for industry/security regulations.

You might want to check that you don't have any undesirable calling home going on from some of your containers. reply CrLf 2 hours agoparentprevSELinux suffers from a reputation problem. It gained that reputation early on, while default policies were still very immature and overly restrictive. One crucial change for the better was leaving third-party software in a permissive state. From that point onwards, disabling SELinux is cargo-cult sysadmin'ing. SELinux is not hard if you understand its basic principles. But no one bothers, because SELinux is the bogeyman. Yes, writing policies means getting knee-deep in macros, and it's hard because many services try to access anything and everything. But almost no one needs to write a policy. At most you need to tell SELinux that some non-default directory should have some label. That's not hard. reply master_crab 1 hour agoparentprevThis. Disabling Was always the first step when we used RHEL years ago. SEL seems to work under the premise that if it’s too complicated for you to use, the attacker has no chance. reply redprince 2 hours agoparentprevBecause pretty much everyone on the internet tells you to disable SELinux instead of trying to understand it. I'm always rolling my eyes when I open some deployment instruction for RHEL (clones) and they have as step one: Disable SELinux. Few will instead read the RHEL provided documentation. Then they could maybe figure out whether there's simply a tunable (getsebool -a) which would enable the desired behavior, or if properly labeling files (semanage fcontext / restorecon) would do it, or even take the steps to add to an existing policy to allow for a specific scenario which somehow was not implemented.

Many in the open source community have interpreted Red Hat’s decision for what it really was: A dick move. I've had a short essay in draft for a while about the difficulty of a small business trying to make money using The Red Hat Model (https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-04-red-hat-model-only...). Red Hat seem like an outlier who're doing well with that model, but smaller places like Sidero or Bitfield had to find other ways to monetise their open source efforts, and sometimes that had pushback from the community. Red Hat, though, were acquired by IBM, and IBM made it harder for an otherwise thriving ecosystem to exist. Not impossible, but harder. IBM makes money hand over fist (billions according to https://www.ibm.com/annualreport/). Was there really a reason to make Red Hat harder to redistribute? The interviews I've read come down to \"our Red Hat team works hard and we don't want to give that away to low effort projects\", though if you've got an interview with a different perspective I'd love to read it. reply TheRealPomax 2 hours agoparentIBM acquired Red Hat in 2019, at which point their revenue had been stuck at \"why isn't our revenue going back up?\" for eight years straight, in the hopes that controlling Red Hat would let them squeeze dollars out of it by making it a premium offering to multinationals and governments. Looking at their revenue since, there's a small trend upward, so was there a reason? Unfortunately, yes. Did it work out? Way harder to say but IBM themselves would probably say yes to that one, too. reply ahoka 2 hours agoparentprevThe Red Hat model is basically “Embrace, extend, and extinguish”. reply rurban 1 hour agorootparentThe Red Hat model is rather to be the professional distro, made by professionals. Ubuntu and Debian are for hobbiests and lawyers, and you should never run a public server on debian/Ubuntu if you care about security. reply _factor 2 minutes agorootparentI’m pretty sure the Red Hat model is to profit off the community efforts while creating convoluted complications in the name of security so they can send their high paid consultants to your business and get paid even more. Was it professional when they let SSH vulnerabilities exist in RHEL7 forcing perfectly useable machines to upgrade to 8 for remediation? Don’t get me wrong, they’re the new “no body got fired for” company (technically still the same). That doesn’t imply Debian and Ubuntu are less secure except in name.

I love Debian and use it on all my home computers. I think the author hit it on the head when he described the security as inconsistent. Some maintainers put a great deal of thought into the security implications of the software they are packaging, including contributing to the AppArmour profile. Others ignore it, and others yet are openly opposed to it. RedHat can declare that everything on the system is going to have SELinux policies following consistent guidelines on what to lock down, and all employees will work with the security team to make this happen. That is harder to do in a community driven project like Debian where ownership and work is widely distributed and entirely voluntary. It can really only happen when the goals are already a strong part of the culture and there is buy-in for specific rules to achieve those goals. For example, Debian's strong free-software requirements have been there from the beginning and so most Debian volunteers are self-selected to agree with or at least tolerate them, and even that has frequent arguments. Security culture is much more mixed, and there are a lot of people in the free software community who think that security starts and ends with fixing bugs when they are found, and push back hard on suggestions that anything more is needed. It is going to take a long time to change that culture. reply rbc 38 minutes agorootparentI prefer Debian as a workstation, though I tend to use FreeBSD for storage (ZFS), and OpenBSD for network edge servers. reply nonrandomstring 39 minutes agorootparentprevI don't like the implication either. And I agree with you that focus is different. It seems unfair to compare Debian and Redhat this way. One is a \"bottom-up\" DIY distro where you can start with almost a kernel and basic userspace and build-up. The other is a more mature product targeted at commercial, public facing infrastructure. The former strongly implies that, if you're using it for the latter case, then you really better know what you're doing. But this capability/competence versus task-fit gets glossed over in the paragraph where the author basically says; because Redhat chose to be a bag of dicks, jumping ship to Debian is the \"logical move\". It isn't if you don't know what you are doing. And it's sad that RH exited this space leaving a civil cybersecurity hole. The lack of a truly Free and \"OOB secure\" OS seems the case in point. There are other reasons to doubt the security of Debian, but \"you're using it wrong\" isn't the best one to discuss. reply layer8 2 hours agoparentprevDebian security updates aren’t slow.

I've seen developers have all that in place, then in their deployable container they start by doing \"apt-get update && apt-get upgrade\" in the Dockerfile and install some runtime dependency that way. There is also another problem, which I believe is what OP is referring to: People will write docker-compose file, Helm charts and what-have-you, which pulls down random images from Docker hub, never to upgrade them, because that breaks something or because: It's a container, it's secure. Fair enough if you pull down the official MariaDB image, or KeyCloak, you still need to upgrade them, and often, but they are mostly trustworthy. But what happens when your service depends on an image created by some dude in Pakistan in 2017 as part of his studies, and it has never been upgraded? I had this discussion with a large client.

We are basically all use containers (well, here; in the real world I almost never encounter devs even knowing what they are, let alone having ever worked with them) and a lot of these containers are made by vendors and maintainers; why can't containers have this rigidity and so must be by default secure? Solve both distribution and security at the same time. It would be easier to actually set rules for containers as they have restricted functionality so at least you know that if you fire up application Bla, it is rock solid by default instead of having to assume security wise they are worthless.

As I'm not sure, will stop here. reply steeeeeve 1 hour agoprev1. You can enable SELinux on debian if you want to. 2. I've never had a conversation with anyone who is enthusiastic about SELinux. 3. I've never run into someone who was good at explaining SELinux policies, how to create them, update them, or explain their decision process other than \"well... the app seems to need to do x, so we should let it.\" 4. I have run into plenty of people that disable SELinux out of the gate to avoid the headache of it. 5. I have run into plenty of people that avoid Redhat distros. This is akin to someone writing an article about how Oracle and Microsoft got databases wrong because they didn't embrace some security feature that only DB2 has and that more than half of DB2 users out there think is a giant pain in the neck. reply osamagirl69 3 hours agoprevTo be honest the never ending headache of getting things to work with SELinux under RHEL was a big driver for why I moved to debian. Certainly SELinux has its place but I never found the value it offers to be worth the complexity it adds. reply RedShift1 2 hours agoparentI never had any real problems with selinux, I've been using CentOS since version 5 something and with even just a cursory understanding of selinux I got by. Plus you could just disable it entirely by changing one setting so distro hopping for just this one thing seems a bit extreme. reply silisili 1 hour agoparentprevSame. People will always scream \"it's not that hard just RTFM\", but it's actually quite complex AND unique to RedHat's world. So of course when you are in a company that has a fleet of a mix of Ubuntu and Debian and RedHat, which is more common than you'd think, it becomes the oddball server nobody likes working on. And nobody wants to spend hours learning it in and out for just that. I don't think I ever worked at a shop that didn't end up disabling it completely out of frustration. reply nicce 3 hours agoparentprevThe same reason why many people choose WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord over things like Signal or Matrix. They are just easier to use. It is about priorities. Maybe some day we solve the usability problems. reply p4bl0 3 hours agorootparentI get it for Matrix, but Signal really has had the same user experience as WhatsApp for years now. But anyway, your point still stands. That's why user-friendliness is an important part of security (and why Signal work is so important regarding secure messaging apps). reply dpassens 2 hours agorootparentAt most a little over one year ago, I installed Signal Desktop to open a link in a message I had received on my desktop. This is, apparently, deliberately unsupported, since the app claims that \"[f]or your security, chat history isn't transferred to new linked devices\". So no, the user experience of WhatsApp is miles ahead of Signal, at least if you want to use a real computer. reply bawolff 2 hours agoprevBe interesting to know if anyone had any numbers on actual security issues in practise. Complexity is generally really bad for security. It results in people working around the system or just turning it off. Security is not just \"in theory\" - a perfectly secure system that most users disable is an insecure system. It reminds me a bit of the idea of making people change their password every month. Sure, in theory it reduces time a compromised credential can be abused for. In practise though it means nobody can remember their password, people start using really poor passwords and writing them down on post it notes. The net result is much worse security practically speaking, even if its better theoretically. reply crdrost 2 hours agoprevThis is a surprising article because I kind of see this in light of the old Linux/BSD wars? “Red Hat owned making this policy apply to most of the popular software they distribute. On Debian the users have to set everything up.” — this sentiment is directly parallel to how BSDs see themselves as providing a whole consistent operating system, Linux meanwhile just wants to ship a kernel. “Debian doesn't care enough about security.” — says everyone who runs OpenBSD. “With SELinux policies, containers are isolated from the system.” — you could almost say they are “in jail,” maybe we could package this up as a syscall, hm, but what to call it...

There needs to be better graphical tools for this, like a \"profiler\" or similar that watches a process for a specific time for errors in the config and that incrementally adds features while the process is running. In my opinion, systemd sandboxes are where it's at. [1] They are seccomp based sandboxes, but have a lot of isolation and sandboxing features that are very easy to use, and they can also be incrementally enhanced with both SELinux and AppArmor profiles.

The key take-away for me is: > The ugly truth is that security is hard. It’s tedious. Unpleasant. And requires a lot of work to get right. I use Red Hat-based distributions at work and Debian/Ubuntu in my personal life. A few years ago, I bit the bullet and learned enough of SELinux to run my workstation and all my servers in enforcing mode. The author of this article is right to credit Red Hat for all the work they’ve done to provide users with default SELinux policies that work out of the box. At one time, I considered installing SELinux on my Debian system and modifying Red Hat’s policies to work with the Debian packages. I realised how much work would be involved so I chose the path of least resistance: AppArmor (which does the job). reply turtle_heck 32 minutes agoprevRelevant: https://stopdisablingselinux.com/ reply fleventynine 2 hours agoprevWith the sheer volume of local exploits found in the Linux kernel, I don't really consider these SELinux/AppArmor mitigations to be that useful. Sure, they reduce the attack surface a bit, but if I actually need isolation between workloads, it's best to do it below the kernel (with a VM). If an attacker gets execution in userspace, it's best to assume they can also get into the kernel via some 0-day local privilege escalation... reply NewJazz 32 minutes agoparentseccomp at least restricts access to certain kernel APIs. Although it is quite brittle. reply throw7 2 hours agoprevI disabled selinux after learning about dontaudit rules and having them waste my time. That's not to say on very specific systems that need to be hardened, I do enable selinux and am glad it's an option. And if I have to use a security layer, I take the object based selinux over the path based apparmor. reply Brian_K_White 1 hour agoprevMeanwhile everyone agreed that the convenience of magic integration with browsers and other things was more critical than security, in the default config, for a password manager of all things, when debian changed the default keepassxc package to omit optional added attack surface plugins. Not unavailable, just not installed by the default. I wonder how many people that agree with this nonsense position also agreed with the keepassxc nonsense position. reply ok123456 2 hours agoprevI've seen poorly implemented SELinux policies make a workstation unusable and fill up /var with audit.logs that are tens of gigs. You have to do 100% coverage testing on whatever program you're using. (Good luck if you don't have the source code.) Otherwise, you don't have any guarantee that your program won't seemingly be killed randomly. Good luck, x2, if you have some snake oil \"endpoint security\" that keeps overriding your SELinux policy changes. reply theossuary 2 hours agoprevI came in expecting not to, but I completely agree with this article. I moved off RHEL after using CentOS exclusively for a decade because of the changes in 2023. I loved SELinux, it's a technology you need to sink your teeth into if you want to understand it, but it has decent tooling (like audit2why) and isn't too hard to modify to get working if needed (SELinux booleans are a powerful way to modify base policies without having to recompile). I do a lot in Kubernetes, and there's been more than one CVE with a line like \"Affects all versions of docker/containerd, unless running SELinux,\" which gave me a lot of reassurance that the effort put into making SELinux work was worth it. Now that I'm on Debian, I'm slowly building a new set of policies for the OS. Thankfully SELinux has an excellent reference policy[1] to base off of. I'm hoping my new debian base images for my homelab & elsewhere will have a nice restrictive default SELinux policy by the end of the year. I hope there's more community effort here as well, SELinux really can't compare to AppArmor, and is absolutely necessary for proper security. Honestly I'd love if the wider community took another stab at replacing SELinux with a KSM that had similar functionality but better tooling and design. I'd pick it up in a heartbeat, but right now SELinux is what we have.

Red Hat is a enterprise operating system for corporate persons where the human persons using their computers are not responsible or in control of their computers. It's apples and oranges. These aren't \"attack surfaces left exposed\" this is \"users allowed to control their own computer and decide for themselves\". And I notice the vast majority of this complaint about insecurity is not about running applications on Debian or RHEL, but instead about the systems built up for running things containerized and trying to mitigate all the problems that causes. Debian concentrates more on actually having an OS you can run applications on rather than a system for deploying containers. >In the end, the choice between Debian and Red Hat isn’t just about corporate influence versus community-driven development. It’s also a choice between a system that assumes the best and one that prepares for the worst. Unfortunately in today’s highly connected world, pessimism is a necessity. In the end it's about weather you think you should control your computer or weather someone else will control your computer. Pick appropriately for context. reply dspillett 3 hours agoparent> Debian is a desktop operating system I suspect Debian is used on more server installs than desktop ones.

Their motivation is user lock-in, not security. reply mmh0000 2 hours agoparentI really don't get this hatred of systemd. Systemd solves many programs that have plagued Linux forever. Sure, SysV-init was super simple, and it was great back in the 1980s or even the 1990s when your server ran just a handful of daemons. But systems get more complex and featureful over the years. In the year 2024, my standard Fedora Linux desktop, has 73 daemons running in the background... Dealing with sysv single-threaded and start-and-forget architecture is not great on modern systems. You might say, well, why not Upstart!? Well. Upstart added a lot of complexity to the init process, while adding very little overall benefit. Systemd added a lot of complexity, no doubt about that. But, it also added a TON of features that reduced complexity elsewhere on the system. I mean, just to rattle a few things off: * systemctl. Holy fuck! A SINGLE command, that works across all modern Linux to control system services. I do not miss the days of service, chkconfig, /etc/init.d/xxx start, update-rc.d, insserv, rc-update, rcconf, sysv-rc-conf, ntsysv. And every distribution having their own special init scripts that worked in a very specific way to that distro. A great example of this is RHEL5's sshd sysv init script, a 500!!! line shell script to start the ssh daemon... Compared to RHEL9's sshd 24 line systemd unit file. * cron - scheduled tasks being handled by a screwball 3rd party service that had no built-in method of ensuring a cronjob would be retried in the event of a failure... systemd timers fixed that nonsense. * at - see above * autofs - Here's a lovely service that is stupidly complex. Whenever I have to setup autofs I get the feeling that the developers purposefully asked themselves \"what can we do to make our application hard to configure?\" then, once they had an answer to that question, they went back to the drawing board and asked, \"Okay, configuring autofs is hard, but, what can we do to make it even more obtuse?\". systemd automounts are drop-dead simple, a 5 line unit file saying what to mount and on what condition. * Parallelization and dependencies - Systemd can start services in parallel and only after their dependencies are ready, unlike SysV’s linear approach. This isn't just for faster boot times; it's also about reliability. Ever had a service fail because another wasn’t ready? Systemd handles that for you. * systemd has overall good built-in security! All services are started in their own cgroup and with posix capabilities and r/w access to the filesystem easily restrictable. You claim systemd is a \"badly written multifunction blob\" but that's mostly not true, look at `/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-*` and `/usr/bin/systemd-*`. Systemd is split out into multiple purpose-specific executables in almost every place where it makes sense to do it. I could go on all day, but I'll stop here. I agree that the system isn't perfect, and they've made some choices I disagree with. But overall, systemd is a MASSIVE improvement over everything that came before it. reply rmholt 1 hour agoprev [–] Would generation of SELinux policies be a good use case for LLMs? \"Generate a SELinux policy for daemon X.

I create and run simulations of asteroid detections, which ends up being mostly orbit calculations. In the next few years the rate of detections of these sort of objects are going to go way up, NEO Surveyor and the Vera Rubin LSST telescopes are going to take our current knowledge of the solar system from about 1.4 million asteroids to approximately 10x that. It is somewhat difficult to estimate how many we will see, since the size distribution follows a power law, and small changes in our estimates of the slope can be huge changes the number which exist. There are most likely hundreds of thousands to millions of a few meter sized asteroids flying around the inner solar system. I did a large chunk of the numerical analysis in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12918 I recommend figure 12 to get a sense of how far we can see at any given moment. The definition which is commonly used as \"hazardous\" is about a 140m asteroid, which would cause a significantly bad day regionally, but not end civilization. That being said, 50m is still a very very bad day. These meter-ish size ones usually just make a pretty fireball.

The impactor that created the Barringer Crater in Arizona is estimated to have been about the same size [2]. Regarding a 100m asteroid impact: > The pressure blast would destroy buildings up to 9 miles (15 km) from ground zero, and windows would shatter more than 60 miles away (100 km). To make matters worse, as the partially burned rock hit the ground, it would trigger seismic tremors that would spread through the planet's crust, carrying the destruction further away from the epicenter. The debris ejected into the air by the force of the impact would rain back on the ground miles away from the impact site, and the finer dust and dirt would remain hanging in the air, spreading with the wind across large distances.[3] I can imagine a 140m asteroid causing a very, very bad day indeed for a region.

Looks like there is not a significant amount of variance in asteroid speed so mass would be the biggest deciding factor. reply ddahlen 2 hours agoparentprevThe range of mass is typically much larger than the range of velocities. There is an upper bound to the speed for the vast majority of things which are dangerous (escape velocity of the solar system). However there are orders of magnitude differences in mass. Velocity is important though. reply seabass-labrax 7 minutes agorootparentAdding a little context for those not familiar with orbital mechanics: the speed of a circular orbit is directly related to its distance from the barycenter (i.e. the Sun). The asteroid belt is between the orbits of Mars (orbiting at 24km/s) and Jupiter (13km/s). Whilst an asteroid that strays far enough to hit Earth (orbiting at 30km/s) is by definition not in an exactly circular orbit, nor one always between Mars and Jupiter, the difference in speeds isn't that great. That accounts for ddahlen's point about the limited range of velocities. Not all asteroids are from the asteroid belt, but I am under the impression that visitors from the outer solar system (which could be as fast as the upper bound that ddahlen mentions) are much more infrequent than stray asteroid belt objects. reply calfuris 1 hour agoparentprevI'm not an astrophysicist, but I was part of a D&D group with one a few years ago and the topic came up (outside the game). In practice the speeds fall into two fairly tight clusters (asteroids and comets), but you don't even need that to justify focusing on mass. There's a hard lower bound on everything, and also a hard upper bound on any object that is part of our solar system, and it works out to at most a factor of 40ish in kinetic energy between the slowest and fastest possible impacts.

I can't figure out where to get more information. In case it's not clear what I mean, one streak is greenish and the other is yellow/red. The triangle is black and one edge of it is colored red and seems to connect the centers of the streaks. I'll take an educated guess: (1) they are two different elevations (2) they are essentially heatmaps of strike probability elongated because of the earth's rotation (3) the triangle is a right triangle situated in a plane perpendicular to the earth's surface so that the red line indicates the angle. It's funny that they'd have a strike location on the surface given that they said it won't hit the surface.

Is this roughly the same for orbiting bodies? If so, it would seem that things on a collision course would be harder to detect, as they're indistinguishable from bodies far away that don't move. Possibly orbital mechanics change this significantly, but over the course of a few days the earth's trajectory is pretty much straight. reply cscheid 2 hours agoparentprevYes, up until recently. The Vera Rubin observatory will change that quite a bit, and soon. Most observatories and telescopes are currently aimed at deep field (very long exposures of tiny portions of the sky). There are a few surveys meant for transients (supernovae, variables etc) and those are also well suited for near earth objects: look at the Catalina sky survey and the zwicky transient facility. When I was (very mildly) involved, the Vera Rubin observatory expected its first 25% of the mission to be overtaken by observing new near earth objects, even as its mission was to catalog variable stars and spot supernovae and other transients. Some interesting stories about how these surveys work today and how they will work in ~10 years.

What the article fails to tell you is that there have been many, many, many more than nine times that asteroids have been spotted, often years in advance, where the initial data had wide enough error bars to make an Earth impact possible, but continued observation quickly ruled that out and predicted, correctly, that the asteroid would pass near the Earth but miss it.

In very simplified terms, say its roughly spherical, the amount of light grows with the second exponent, so twice bigger object reflect 4 times as much light - but it is also potentially 8 times as heavy (eq. volume grows with third exponent) & thus more dangerous. Trade-offs. :) reply krisoft 3 hours agorootparent> Bigger object should reflect more light, making detection more likely. That assumes that the detection is photon constrained and not \"nobody is looking in most directions\" constrained.

But the impact of one such particle, even ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, can be safely ignored. Everything of asteroid size, or on the Torino Scale [0] is in the realm described by classical mechanical physics, and it will merrily follow it's existing trajectory whether or not we know about it in advance. So, the only question is whether or not it's better to know it's arriving some hours/days/weeks in advance. * Certainly better in cases like this (observable but harmless). * Definitely would be better in cases like the Chelyabinsk meteor [1] which caused a fair amount of damage and some injuries, if people would be given a warning to avoid being near windows, etc. * Absolutely better in cases of regional devastation to global catastrophe where we have time and resources to alter the trajectory to reduce or eliminate harm. Even just enough lead time to only move many of the people out of the impact damage region is a definite benefit. * YMMV in cases of in cases of regional devastation to global catastrophe where we lack time and resources to alter the trajectory or move people. Is it better to know you'll die in X hours or be surprised? So, I'd say everything below Torino-5 is definitely a good discovery (I think this is a Torino-0], and everything above depends on circumstances. Overall, a very good idea.

Things in orbit around the sun don't move in straight lines, even if their paths are going to intersect. The earlier you see it, the less it's moving straight at you.

    "originBody": "Intel Honesty Posted onTuesday, September 3, 2024Wednesday, September 4, 2024 Author by Ben Thompson It really is a valley: There, right in the middle of the Santa Clara Valley, formed by the Santa Cruz Mountains on the west and the Diablo Range on the east, lies the once-sleepy city of Mountain View. Mountain View was dominated by the U.S. Navy’s Moffett Field in 1955, when William Shockley, one of the inventors of the transistor at Bell Labs, returned to neighboring Palo Alto to care for his ailing mother. Convinced that silicon was a superior material for transistors — Bell Labs was focused on germanium — Shockley, unable to hire many Bell Labs co-workers both because of the distance from New Jersey and also his abusive management style, set up the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in 1956 in Mountain View with a collection of young scientists. Only a year later eight of those scientists, led by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, fled Shockley — he really was a terrible manager — and set up Fairchild Semiconductor, a new division of Fairchild Camera and Instrument, in neighboring Sunnyvale. It was Fairchild Semiconductor that gave the tech industry’s home the other half of its name: yes, we talk about “The Valley”, but at least when it comes to tech, we mean Silicon Valley. From TechCrunch in 2014: As Fairchild started to grow, employees began to leave the firm to launch new spin-off businesses. Many of these firms also grew quickly, inspiring other employees still working at the company…The growth of these new companies started to reshape the region. In just 12 years, the co-founders and former employees of Fairchild generated more than 30 spin-off companies and funded many more. By 1970, chip businesses in the San Francisco area employed a total of 12,000 people… The achievements of these companies eventually attracted attention. In 1971, a journalist named Don Hoefler wrote an article about the success of computer chip companies in the Bay Area. The firms he profiled all produced chips using silicon and were located in a large valley south of San Francisco. Hoefler put these two facts together to create a new name for the region: Silicon Valley. Hoefler’s article and the name he coined have become quite famous, but there’s a critical part of his analysis that is often overlooked: Almost all of the silicon chip companies he profiled can be traced back to Fairchild and its co-founders. Still, for all of the massive success downstream from Fairchild Semiconductor, none mattered more, or came to define Silicon Valley in every respect, than Intel. Arthur Rock, who had helped the so-called “Traitorous Eight” find Fairchild Camera and Instrument, funded Intel, and in the process created the compensation structure that came to define Silicon Valley. Gordon Moore wrote the roadmap for Intel — nor more commonly known as Moore’s Law — which “predicted” that the number of transistors would double at a set rate, both increasing compute speed and driving down prices for that compute; “predict” is in quotes because Moore’s Law was not a physical law, but an economic one, downstream of Intel’s inexorable push for continued improvement. That, by extension, meant that Intel set the pace of innovation for all of technology, not just by making the processors for the PC — and, in an underrated wave of disruption in the early part of this century, the cloud — but also by defining the expectations of every software engineer in the entire world. Intel’s Long Decline Stratechery has, from the beginning, operated with a great degree of reverence for tech history; perhaps that’s why I’ve always been a part of the camp cheering for Intel to succeed. The unfortunate fact of the matter is that the need for cheerleading has been clear for as long as I have written this blog: in May 2013 I wrote that Intel needed to build out a foundry business, as the economics of their IDM business, given their mobile miss, faced long-term challenges. Unfortunately not only did Intel not listen, but their business got a lot worse: in the late 2010’s Intel got stuck trying to move to 10nm, thanks in part to their reluctance to embrace the vastly more expensive EUV lithography process, handing the performance crown to TSMC. Meanwhile Intel’s chip design team, increasingly fat and lazy thanks to the fact they could leverage Intel’s once-industry-leading processes, had started to fall behind AMD; today AMD has both better designs and, thanks to the fact they fab their chips at TSMC, better processes. Meanwhile, the rise of hyperscalers meant there were entities that both had the scale to justify overcoming whatever software advantages Intel had, and the resources to do so; the result is that AMD has been taking data center share for years, and is on the verge of passing 50%: [Editor’s Note: these two paragraphs are technically incorrect, in that AMD’s data center revenue includes their AI chips; the directionally point remains, but I regret the erros] This chart actually understates the problem, because it only includes x86 processors; in fact, those capabilities that have allowed the hyperscalers to take advantage of AMD’s increasingly superior total cost of ownership have also been devoted to building ARM-based server chips. Amazon in particular has invested heavily in its Graviton line of chips, taking advantage of ARM’s theoretically better efficiency and lower licensing fees (as compared to Intel’s margins). Beyond that, what is especially problematic — and why Intel’s datacenter revenue is actually down year-over-year — is that an increasing amount of data center spend is going towards AI, the latest paradigm where Intel missed the boat. [End Editor’s Note] The story Intel — or at least its past management — wants you to believe about mobile is that they foolishly passed up the opportunity to supply Apple’s iPhone, not realizing that the volume would more than make up for the margin hit; in fact, Tony Fadell told me that while Steve Jobs wanted Intel — Apple had just switched to using Intel chips for Macs — Intel chips weren’t competitive: For me, when it came to Intel at the time, back in the mid-2000s, they were always about, “Well, we’ll just repackage what we have on the desktop for the laptop and then we’ll repackage that again for embedding.” It reminded me of Windows saying, “I’m going to do Windows and then I’m going to do Windows Mobile and I’m going to do Windows embedded.” It was using those same cores and kernels and trying to slim them down… The mindset at Intel was never about — when they went through that CISC-RISC duality of “Which one are we going to be?”, and they chose CISC, which was the right thing at the time, if you fast forward, they also made that decision, they threw away architectural and they went to more manufacturing. That was the time when they said “We don’t have to worry about all these different product lines to meet all these architectural needs. We’re just going to have Moore’s Law take over” and so in a way that locks you into a path and that’s why Intel, not under the Pat days but previous to the Pat days, was all driven by manufacturing capability and legal. It wasn’t driven by architectural decisions, it was like, “Here’s what we got and we’re going to spread it around and we’re going to keep reusing it”. In fact, it does go back to the Pat days, specifically CEO Pat Gelsinger’s initial stint at Intel. He was the one that pushed CISC over RISC, arguing that Intel’s CISC software advantage, supported by the company’s superior manufacturing, would ensure that the company dominated microprocessors. And, as Fadell noted, it worked, at least in PCs and servers. Where it didn’t work was mobile: Intel couldn’t leverage its manufacturing to make x86 competitive with ARM, particularly since the latter had a head start on software; it also didn’t work in GPUs, where Intel spent years trying to build x86-based gaming chips that — you guessed it — were meant to rely on Intel’s manufacturing prowess. GPUs, of course, are the foundation of today’s AI boom, and while Intel bought Gaudi to offer AI chips, they haven’t made a dent in the market — and oh, by the way, Gaudi chips are manufactured by TSMC. IDM 2.0 None of this story is new; I recounted it in 2021’s Intel Problems. My solution then — written shortly after Gelsinger came back to Intel, fifteen years after being passed over for the CEO job — was that the company needed to split up. Integrating design and manufacturing was the foundation of Intel’s moat for decades, but that integration has become a strait-jacket for both sides of the business. Intel’s designs are held back by the company’s struggles in manufacturing, while its manufacturing has an incentive problem. The key thing to understand about chips is that design has much higher margins; Nvidia, for example, has gross margins between 60~65%, while TSMC, which makes Nvidia’s chips, has gross margins closer to 50%. Intel has, as I noted above, traditionally had margins closer to Nvidia, thanks to its integration, which is why Intel’s own chips will always be a priority for its manufacturing arm. That will mean worse service for prospective customers, and less willingness to change its manufacturing approach to both accommodate customers and incorporate best-of-breed suppliers (lowering margins even further). There is also the matter of trust: would companies that compete with Intel be willing to share their designs with their competitor, particularly if that competitor is incentivized to prioritize its own business? The only way to fix this incentive problem is to spin off Intel’s manufacturing business. Yes, it will take time to build out the customer service components necessary to work with third parties, not to mention the huge library of IP building blocks that make working with a company like TSMC (relatively) easy. But a standalone manufacturing business will have the most powerful incentive possible to make this transformation happen: the need to survive. Two months later and Gelsinger announced his turnaround plan: IDM 2.0. Intel would separate out its manufacturing into a separate division that would serve third parties, but still under the Intel banner. Gelsinger told me in an interview that this was the only way Intel could both be competitive in chips and keep investing in the leading edge; after all, AMD’s spin-off of Global Foundries resulted in the former floundering until they could break their purchase agreements with Global Foundries and go to TSMC, and the latter giving up on the leading edge. Gelsinger is persuasive and optimistic, and for the last three years I’ve given him the benefit of the doubt. Suddenly, though, a split is back on the table; from Bloomberg: Intel Corp. is working with investment bankers to help navigate the most difficult period in its 56-year history, according to people familiar with the matter. The company is discussing various scenarios, including a split of its product-design and manufacturing businesses, as well as which factory projects might potentially be scrapped, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private… A potential separation or sale of Intel’s foundry division, which is aimed at manufacturing chips for outside customers, would be an about-face for Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger. Gelsinger has viewed the business as key to restoring Intel’s standing among chipmakers and had hoped it would eventually compete with the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which pioneered the foundry industry. As the article notes, Intel is likely to consider less drastic steps first; Reuters reported that ideas include selling businesses like its Altera programmable chip business and reducing capital expeditures, including axing a proposed foundry in Germany. The company also finally killed its dividend, and is cutting 15,000 jobs, which frankly, isn’t enough; I noted in an Update last week: Intel ended last year with 124,800 people; to put that in context, TSMC had 76,478 employees and AMD 26,000, which is to say that the two companies combined had fewer employees than Intel while making better x86 chips, an actually competitive GPU, and oh yeah, making chips for everyone else on earth, including Apple and Nvidia. A 15,000 employee cut is both too small and too late. The fundamental problem facing the company is encapsulated in that paragraph: Intel doesn’t have the best manufacturing Intel doesn’t design the best chips Intel is out of the game in AI Moreover, the future does not look bright; the problem with Intel’s most recent earnings call was threefold: Intel’s is technically on pace to achieve the five nodes in four years Gelsinger promised (in truth two of those nodes were iterations), but they haven’t truly scaled any of them; the first attempt to do so, with Intel 3, destroyed their margins. This isn’t a surprise: the reason why it is hard to skip steps is not just because technology advances, but because you have to actually learn on the line how to implement new technology at scale, with sustainable yield. Go back to Intel’s 10nm failure: the company could technically make a 10nm chip, they just couldn’t do so economically; there are now open questions about Intel 3, much less next year’s promised 18A. Intel is dramatically ramping up its Lunar Lake architecture as it is the only design the company has that is competitive with the Qualcomm ARM architecture undergirding Microsoft’s CoPilot+ PC initiative; the problem is that Lunar Lake’s tiles — including its CPU — are made by TSMC, which is both embarrassing and also terrible for margins. The third problem is that the goal Gelsinger has been pushing for is the aforementioned 18A, yet Intel has yet to announce a truly committed at-scale partner. Yes, the company is in talks with lots of folks and claims some number of secret agreements, but at this point the foundry strategy needs real proof points; unfortunately Intel itself ramping up on TSMC, even as it loses control of its costs, isn’t exactly a selling point as to why any third-party should put their fortunes in Intel’s hands. All that noted, my initial response to the meltdown over Intel’s earnings was to defend Gelsinger; what is happening to Intel now is downstream of mistakes that happened years before Gelsinger came back to the company. That remains true, but Gelsinger does have one fatal flaw: he still believes in Intel, and I no longer do. Market Realities Here is the fundamental problem facing Intel, and by extension, U.S. dreams of controlling leading edge capacity: there is no reason for Intel Foundry to exist. Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and other leading edge fabless chip companies rely on TSMC, and why wouldn’t they? TSMC invested in EUV, surpassed Intel, and are spending tens of billions of dollars a year to continue pushing forward to 2nm and beyond. Yes, TSMC priced 3nm too low, but even if the company raises prices for future nodes, as I expect them to, the relative cost matters much less than TSMC’s superior customer services and demonstrated reliability. The kicker is that the smartest decision for Intel’s own chip unit is to — as they are with Lunar Lake — rely on TSMC’s manufacturing as well. Intel still has advantages in PCs and a dominant position in on-premises and government data centers, but the best way to leverage those remaining areas of strength is to have TSMC make their chips. This was, for the record, why Gelsinger did have a point in keeping the company together; Intel Foundry needs volume, and the easiest way to get that volume is from Intel itself. However, that by definition is a decision that is not driven by what is best for a theoretical Intel fabless business, but rather the impetus to restore Intel’s manufacturing capability, even as that manufacturing capability is heavily incentivized to cater to Intel’s chip business at the expense of external customers. Gelsinger’s trump card has been the fact that TSMC is based in Taiwan, which is under continuous threat from China. Indeed, Gelsinger has been quite explicit on this point; from CNA English News in 2021: Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech summit in California on Wednesday that the United States government should support a sustainable semiconductor supply chain in the U.S., in part because “Taiwan is not a stable place”… Asked about the comment, TSMC Chairman Mark Liu (劉德音) said, “there’s nothing that needs to be addressed. TSMC does not speak ill of other companies in the industry,” and added there were probably not many people who believed Gelsinger’s argument. Geopolitical tensions, Liu said, may have a short-term impact, but he believed Taiwan could help create a brilliant decade for the global semiconductor industry, with the best technology and the best manufacturing ecosystem. Gelsinger made the same point to me in that interview while explaining why Intel needed to stay together: As we look at this, to me, there is almost a global national perspective to this, in that I deeply believe the West needs a world class technology provider, and I don’t think that splitting Intel in two, that it could survive for many, many, many years till that would become the case, that you could stand that up. Remember, given cash flows, R&D streams, products that enable us to drive that, and I’m committed to go fix it, and I think we’re on a good path to go fix it since I’ve been here as well. So for those three different reasons, we chose the IDM 2.0 path, but it’s not because we didn’t look at the alternative, it’s partially because we did. This is where everyone who is invested in American manufacturing — or perhaps more accurately, concerned about China’s threat to Taiwan — has to get brutally honest. If the U.S. government and U.S. tech companies want to have a non-Taiwan option, they are going to have to pay for it directly. Yes, the CHIPS Act passed, but while Intel is getting a lot of funds, it’s going to take a lot more — and the price of those funds needs to be a much smarter incentive structure that drives Intel apart. My proposal back in 2021 was purchase guarantees instead of subsidies, and I am back to thinking that is the only viable path. That is why a federal subsidy program should operate as a purchase guarantee: the U.S. will buy A amount of U.S.-produced 5nm processors for B price; C amount of U.S. produced 3nm processors for D price; E amount of U.S. produced 2nm processors for F price; etc. This will not only give the new Intel manufacturing spin-off something to strive for, but also incentivize other companies to invest; perhaps Global Foundries will get back in the game, or TSMC will build more fabs in the U.S. And, in a world of nearly free capital, perhaps there will finally be a startup willing to take the leap. That free capital world is gone, and it’s probably not realistic for a startup to figure out how to manufacture the most complex devices humans have ever produced; the best idea at this point is a new company that has the expertise and starting position of Intel Foundry. Critically, though, it shouldn’t be at all beholden to x86 chips, have hundreds of thousands of employees, or the cultural overhang of having once led the computing world. The best we can do is purchase guarantees — on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade — and a prayer that someone can make such an entity stand on its own. To summarize, there is no market-based reason for Intel Foundry to exist; that’s not a market failure in a purely economic sense, but to the extent the U.S. national security apparatus sees it as a failure is the extent to which the U.S. is going to have to pay to make it happen. And, if the U.S. is going to pay up, that means giving that foundry the best possible chance to stand on its own two feet in the long run. That means actually earning business from Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and yes, even the fabless Intel company that will remain. The tech world has moved on from Intel; the only chance for U.S. leading edge manufacturing is to do the same. I wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update.

Its debt repayments alone are massive. The poor performance in stock has encouraged 20years of wage stagnation to the point where you can literally earn over 50% more at amd or nvidia or even an startup for equivalent roles so they aren’t hiring the best. Their pay in the Bay Area is double tsmc in taiwan for equivalent roles in raw dollar terms but the ppp differences means your better off working for tsmc in Taiwan than intel in the Bay Area. That’s not a joke. Intel are literally incapable of attracting talent from Taiwan right now. They don’t have the talent they need and the debt trap and poor performance means a lot of push back to the needed doubling of wages to attract that talent. It’s a very hard sell for any exec trying to correct this problem. They sidelined lip bu tan who was one of the advocates for even more layoffs and wage freezes but he’s one of many backwards thinkers they need to remove. It’s going to be difficult to fix their board. Without talent intel has no hope of winning and they can’t get that talent due to poor stock performance for the past 20years leading to executives and shareholders wishing to implement the opposite of what they need right now. In fact they have ongoing layoffs right now. A true downward spiral and the only real hope is for a newcomer to step up. reply closeparen 50 minutes agoparent>Their pay in the Bay Area is double tsmc in taiwan for equivalent roles in raw dollar terms but the ppp differences means your better off working for tsmc in Taiwan than intel in the Bay Area.

Food and childcare, in particular, are so much cheaper than California that it’s hard to believe. Those are downstream of housing restrictions to a large extent. From \"Housing theory of everything\" [0]: Consider a cleaner living in Alabama. In 1960 they could move to NYC and earn wages 84% higher, and still end up with 70% higher income after rent. In 2010, they could move to New York City and become 28% more productive, and earn a wage 28% higher – and reduce the surplus of workers back home, letting them demand higher pay. But since housing costs are so much higher, the net earnings and living standards of someone like this would fall if they moved today, and wouldn’t be worth it. The same would be true for plumbers, receptionists and other professions that allow other people to specialise at what they’re best at and minimise the time they spend on things like DIY and answering the phone. By contrast, top lawyers get wage boosts that are still sufficiently higher to justify a move in both 1960 and 2010, even after the higher rents they’ll have to pay.

The question still remains how many US folks can /want to go live in Taiwan vs How many Taiwanese can / want to live in US suburban dystopia. And I say this as immigrant to US increasingly disenchanted by suburbia. From what I read housing price to income ratio has increased ~2.5 times from 6.5 to 15.8 in last two decades in Taiwan. And it seems to be worse in new developments in city like Taipei.

And it's because of zoning. Cities allow density construction but then it's almost exclusively 0 and 1 bedroom apartments because you can charge more per sq ft. Zoning laws should force apartment construction to include multiple bedroom units but that would lower the cost of 1br units. So NIMBYs don't want density construction, and the people who build density don't want big units. So cities are unlivable if you're not young and single or happy living in relative squalor. So people either don't have children or have to move to have children and you get cities that push out a big chunk of the demographic and then force people to commute. reply lotsofpulp 29 minutes agorootparentprevPart of the equation must be the simple fact that the US is big and has the option to give many people the 0.1+ acre detached single family home with a yard and 2+ car driveway/garage lifestyle (and schools with more exclusive student populations). In smaller places, that simply isn’t an option, so there exists greater demand for family living in high rises. reply ghaff 16 minutes agorootparentYeah, very few people who want and can afford 3-bedroom homes want to be renting apartments.

Experience is a positive, but less positive because of it. There is a lot of potential that could be made from newer hires combined with focused in house training/experimentation - which is what all these businesses had to do in their initial expansion - with not enough people of experience at scale available, and they probably had to do a running training ramp up multiple times over multiple generations of growth.

I don't really blame Intel for deciding to go with self-aligned quadruple patterning for 10 nm, but combining it with cobalt interconnects was probably biting off more than they could chew. FWIW, Intel was funding EUV R&D since 1997: https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/1997/CN0911...

We need to learn to recognize the difference between something that's never going to happen for either physical or economic/social/structural reasons, and something that is just really difficult and takes a long time. I always think of this when I think about fusion and the irritating \"fusion is 20 years away and always will be\" meme. In reality fusion has been edging closer, and closer, and closer for decades. Like EUV lithography it's just incredibly hard and requires a ton of capital and time and some of the smartest people on Earth to make it a reality. The same logic applies to things like a working HIV vaccine, life extension, or human space flight and space settlement. The reason there's never been a year of the Linux desktop on the other hand has to do with the full picture of what's required to mass market a desktop OS and support that, not just the technical problems, as well as business reasons around what Microsoft does to incentivize vendors to stay in their ecosystem.

Some domestic industries still operate in an environment somewhat like this (e.g. the steel industry), but still face modernized global competition (albeit whose effects are kept at bay via import tariffs reaching as high as 266%). The semiconductor industry... while there are magnificent barriers to entry and not \"enough\" competition, they have absolutely not been wholly insulated from innovation or competition. And innovation in fabrication is driven at a very rapid pace! So there aren't huge outsized profits to be found like there was for SpaceX. And even SpaceX needed to invent what was almost an entirely new industry (Starlink) to become truly profitable. And even trying to pull a \"SpaceX\" on domestic steel manufacturing would fall flat because you wouldn't capture the global market, and would still be dependent on some (potentially much lower) tariffs to compete against the very modernized factories in China, which are innovative/competitive/efficient, unlike our domestic industry. SpaceX took advantage of a very rare situation where there truly was no competition or innovation anywhere on the planet for a very long period.

I doubt that they need to do much innovation to keep that moat either (in contrast to say Apple and their 30% cut of App Store revenues - they need to constantly stay ahead of Android and Windows). Curious to hear your take on what other industries at least come close to the space dynamics in 2010. reply ska 37 minutes agorootparentFrom what i can see as an admitted outsider, payment rails are more complicated than they look, and most of the crypto partisans arguments to \"replace\" functionality are a mix of 'ignoring that part', or 'we don't want that part anyway' + a few API calls. Problem is, the world consuming these things mostly seems to want those parts, and can't ignore those other parts.

SpaceX was relatively cheap - the company itself only raised 2 billion dollars, and according to Musk, the cost to develop Falcoln Heavy was \"only\" $500M. I think the \"thesis\" behind SpaceX is moreso that the technology to develop rockets had come down massively, but the market had gotten fat and lazy on government contracts. The market only seemed impossible because everyone just assumed so. On the other hand ASML's EUV machine costs $300M and that's only a small part of what you need build your own Fab and barring some massive research breakthrough that isn't coming down any time soon. reply amluto 28 minutes agoparentprevMaybe one of the e-beam startups can pull it off. Aside from scaling issues, direct electron beam lithography ought to outperform optical lithography by many metrics, not to mention that there would never be costs associated with mask revisions. Here’s one of them: https://multibeamcorp.com/ I remember touring a little research fab, maybe around 2000, that could achieve feature sizes comparable to what TSMC can do today. But they were very, very, very slow. (Fast-moving electrons are easy to make, easy to aim, and have teeny tiny wavelengths that entirely sidestep most the issues that people have with photons having obnoxiously large wavelengths. But electrons have all manner of downsides that explain why fabs spend many billions of dollars on optical lithography, one of which is that they repel each other, which makes shining a lot of them at a wafer at once quite problematic.) reply FuriouslyAdrift 47 minutes agoparentprevTSMC has been spending $15 - $50 billion per year for years to stay on top.

The amount of research and development it takes to build a light source (hot tin plasma[1]) is extraordinary, and fabs are also probably the most complicated manufacturing facilities in the world.

SpaceX and Tesla benefited from being helmed by a crazy person (in their nascent stages), who pushed to break norms in the conventional thinking, either \"rockets can't be reused/we must spend $10B on a test campaign[2] before any part leaves the ground\" and \"EVs aren't cool\". I don't think if Musk could design a rocket engine from scratch is relevant, but the strategic design patterns of 1) reduce requirements, 2) remove unused things, 3) simplify/optimize, 4) accelerate cycle times, 5) automate.

If the US truly views having a domestic foundry as critical to national security, the US federal government has no choice but to pay up big time to support Intel's foundry business until -- hopefully, eventually -- that business is able to compete profitably against TSMC to manufacture chips for Apple, Nvidia, AMD, etc. Oh, how the mighty have fallen! reply flerchin 1 hour agoprevBrutal.

TSMC will finish western fabs eventually, but the delta-t on when they become competitive (tech, capacity & cost, remember) with even Intel's western fabs is... decades, plural? Maybe never? The CHIPS act helped, but TSMC is dragging their feet for very, very (existentially) good reason. Also, remember that TSMC is built entirely on the back of ASML; conflict with China doesn't just block the west's access to the east's fab capacity, it blocks the east's access to the west's tooling to build more and better fabs. TSMC craters in this scenario. Samsung also exists. That's the list of near-SotA fab capacity, globally. Capacity is another good reason: TSMC is not a bottomless bucket, and every year for the past at least two years Apple has purchased 100% of their SotA fab capacity. No one is competing with Apple's margins (except Nvidia, but that's a bubble market; numbered days). His argument is that there's no market reason for Intel's fabs to exist; we don't have the data to say for certain, but I'd guess that if Intel went to TSMC and said \"you're already making lunar lake, make our xeon chips too\" TSMC would say \"we can't\" (especially on SotA nodes, but maybe even near-SotA). They're tapped out, they grow, they're instantly tapped out again, everyone wants what they're selling. Intel fabs Lunar Lake and Arc with TSMC; both very-low volume. Also worth keeping in mind: Intel was at one time the global leader in chip fabrication; but they lost that crown. People view TSMC as this unassailable beast, but they're just as fallible; and when I hear people say \"Well, Intel 18A is probably three years out and by that time we'll have TSMC N2P with backside power delivery so who will even care about Intel 18A\" are just extrapolating history. That's a dangerous game when all these rankings and valuations are based on asymptotically approaching the limits of the laws of physics. And while it is unlikely that Intel will take the lead again, TSMC showing any sign of faltering will raise the relative value of the #2 companies. Intel is not in a good spot, but they're still an interesting business, they're still designing some of the best chips on the planet, and with the right decisions could grow to be even better than interesting. IMO, this article is missing a lot of the hard analysis and data that Stratechery is usually known for; I don't feel you can have a researched discussion on Intel without talking about fabrication volume or their concerning levels of debt, but he didn't mention either of those things.

    "originBody": "NEWS Theory Faster Integer Programming A new analysis proves that all integer programs theoretically could be solved much faster than previously guaranteed. By Don Monroe Posted Sep 3 2024 Credit: Getty Images Share Twitter Reddit Hacker News Download PDF Print Join the Discussion View in the ACM Digital Library Integer [Linear] Programming Randomized, Recursive Algorithm Covering Radius Practical Challenges Further Reading Many important practical computations, such as scheduling, combinatorial, and optimization problems, use techniques known as integer programming to find the best combination of many variables. In these problems, some or all of the variables are restricted to integer values, which requires exponentially greater resources to solve than if the variables could take any value. Last year, Victor Reis, now at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, and his Ph.D. advisor Thomas Rothvoss of the University of Washington, proved a new upper bound on the time required to solve for any integer program. They analyzed an algorithm described more than a decade ago in the influential Ph.D. thesis of Daniel Dadush, now in the Netherlands at CWI (the Center for Mathematics and Informatics) and Utrecht University. “In some sense the algorithm is his, but we have proven that it works,” Rothvoss said. “The proof basically says that you can solve an integer linear program, in theory, almost as well as you can solve one where the integer variable is only zero or one,” he added. Such either/or problems include many important integer-programming challenges, such as the classic NP-hard (non-polynomial) traveling-salesperson problem. (In this case, each variable indicates whether or not a leg between a particular pair of cities is on the chosen route.) Even with only two choices per variable, the number of possibilities grows exponentially with the number of variables, “So you need something smarter than just trying them all out,” Rothvoss said. For variables that can take any integer value, the new result is the first proven speed advance in decades. “I was super-duper excited and really surprised,” said Noah Stephens-Davidowitz of Cornell University, who published an important predecessor for the work. “I was so impressed by how they managed to find a proof of this incredibly deep, important result.” “It is a very important theoretical advancement,” agreed Amitabh Basu of Johns Hopkins University. However, algorithms based on this strategy are too cumbersome for everyday use, he added. “From a practical perspective, none of these algorithms are actually implemented in practice.” Instead, integer programming problems are analyzed with rules tuned to specific cases. “Most of them are heuristics,” Basu said, “so you cannot really prove anything very interesting about the algorithm.” Nevertheless, “In practice they are very efficient. They solve industrial-scale problems all the time,” sometimes with tens of thousands of variables, he said. Integer [Linear] Programming Algorithms for integer programming often take a first stab at a solution with linear programming, which is outwardly similar but allows the variables to vary continuously. Linear constraints, expressed as inequalities, restrict solutions to a convex subregion in what is often a very high-dimensional variable space. The highest or lowest value of a linear objective function occurs at one of the vertices of this convex region, and finding it is relatively fast, depending only polynomially on the dimension n (the number of variables). In contrast, restricting the variables to integer values requires a time increasing exponentially with n, even if the constraints and objective function are linear (known as integer linear programming). “When you have continuous variables, you have access to all of your tools from calculus,” Basu said, such as following gradients. “Once you enforce that your variables cannot take an arbitrary value, all of this goes out of the window.” Indeed, integer programs like the traveling salesman problem are in the class of problems for which there is no polynomial algorithm. “If you could solve integer programming as efficiently,” he said, “you would prove that P=NP. We don’t actually believe that you should be able to solve integer programming faster than exponential in the number of variables.” Heuristic techniques for integer programming typically use problem-specific guidelines to divide the possible integer combinations into subsets and then estimate bounds on the possible outcomes to prune unpromising branches. This widely used “branch and bound” technique, defined in 1960 by Ailsa Land and Alison Doig, can be applied recursively to choose promising branches that lead to good solutions, although with no guarantee of how quickly they will be found. Randomized, Recursive Algorithm Reis and Rothvoss’s work also builds on decades of history about provable bounds for integer programs, beginning with 1983 work by Hendrik Lenstra. Unlike heuristics, the algorithms use an abstract procedure that works for any problem to sift through potential solutions. The techniques focus on the region of variable space that satisfies all the constraints. The constraints are generally linear inequalities that require solutions to be on one side of a hyperplane, so this “feasible region” is a convex, high-dimensional polyhedron. It suffices to ask whether it contains any points that are part of the infinite, regular lattice of integer combinations. “We want to study how the lattice interplays with a convex set,” Reis said. “From a mathematical perspective, it’s not really very different whether you [aim to] optimize a linear function or just find any feasible point.” Rothvoss said. If the volume contains multiple points, “you can use a binary search and then find the optimum” among them. A key technique, introduced in the late 1980s by Ravi Kannan (with his frequent coauthor László Lovász) is to project both the lattice and the feasible region onto a space of lower dimension d, and check whether the projected region contains a projected lattice point. “I want reduce the problem to something lower-dimensional,” Reis said. The algorithm randomly chooses a target subspace that approximates the most effective projection. “You … can take the best direction on which to project.” The projected region may include the projection of various lattice points. For each such point, Dadush’s algorithm reverses the projection to find the subset of the original convex set, with dimension n–d, projected onto that point. The process is applied recursively to see if that subset contains a lattice point. If not, it can be ignored. If it does, the dimension-reducing process is then applied to that subset, to definitively decide in a guaranteed time whether the original convex set contains a lattice point. Covering Radius Dadush’s algorithm “is basically the backbone of what we used,” Reis said. “We just had a better approximation to a quantity that’s known as the covering radius. He showed that, if he had such a better approximation, you would get a faster algorithm for integer programming.” For a lattice completely decorated with n-dimensional balls, the covering radius is the minimum radius that guarantees that they cover all of variable space. For integer programming, the phrase extends to the minimum scaling factor for the constraint-satisfying feasible region to cover space when repeated around every lattice point. More relevant for the algorithm, this also means that no matter how the feasible region is translated around the space, it includes at least one lattice point. In 2016, Stephens-Davidowitz and his then-Ph.D. co-advisor Oded Regev at New York University proved a conjecture by Dadush that was a key precursor for Reis and Rothvoss’s proof. “What Reis and Rothvoss did is they extended the result about the covering radius of balls to what are called convex bodies, a much, much larger class of bodies, like cubes and parallelograms and all sorts of things like that,” he said. “That’s what’s needed for integer programming.” “We did think about extending it to arbitrary convex bodies, but we basically convinced ourselves quite quickly that that was really, really hard,” Stephens-Davidowitz said. “The amazing thing about this Rothvoss and Reis paper—I say this entirely with admiration—is it’s not that difficult in hindsight. The proof is quite clean.” Previously, the proven minimum time to find a solution was roughly nn. The new proof guarantees a much shorter (log n)O(n), where O(n) means “of order n.” Since even log(n) is a big number for large n, this is somewhat greater than the 2n bound for the zero/one versions but has the same simple exponential dependence. “Getting it down to 2n would be amazing, because that would really complete the story, theoretically speaking,” Basu said. But getting to (log n)n is a big, big deal from the theoretical perspective.” Practical Challenges Still, “It’s more like a theoretical understanding of this entire set of problems than something that you actually might want to use for any particular one,” Ries conceded. In most practical cases, “There’s a particular kind of integer program people want to solve. For most of these cases there are ad hoc heuristics that work much better in practice than our worst-case algorithm,” which works for any problem. “If we want to actually implement this, there are several hurdles we need to overcome,” Ries cautioned. One is that the memory requirements are exponential, whereas practical approaches like heuristics “actually run in polynomial space. We don’t know if that’s possible” for the general-purpose algorithm. In addition, “There are several other subroutines in our algorithm that we still don’t have efficient algorithms for in practice.” Still, although the performance of heuristics is not proved, “On any practical problem that you come across, they’re actually very good,” Rothvoss agreed. “Could our algorithm be better for certain instances? If you have some particularly nasty instances where the range of the variables is extremely large, or the feasible region is extremely thin in certain directions, maybe.” Further Reading Reis, V. and Rothvoss, T.

I would really encourage anyone that has never worked with these tools before to explore them as it can open a palette of tools and ideas you may not have thought of before. A great free way to get into this is to read the examples and use PuLP for Python. reply petters 2 hours agoparentThe best solvers are really impressive.

They solve industrial-scale problems all the time,” sometimes with tens of thousands of variables. Although the number of variables or constraints is not a good measure of the hardness of an ILP, \"tens of thousands\" is not that unusual. During my PhD, I often solved programs with millions of variables and constraints. These programs were so large that even \"building\" them in the solver library took several seconds. Impressively, gurobi was often able to optimize them in under 24 hours. I have two results here where gurobi solved 1M * 8M problems to optimality in under 2 hours. That was several years ago, so I expect newer versions to be even faster. Even for larger problems (around 5M * 50M) it often found provably near-optimal solutions (within 5% of optimality) very fast. gurobi is really an impressive piece of software, and free for academic use. reply hustwindmaple1 8 hours agoparentI was on CPLEX team for a few years. Core developers are all PhDs from Stanford/MIT and etc. So it's very hardcore stuff, no less than AI research. Completely agree that size is not a good proxy for estimating MIP difficulties. Internally we colllected a bunch of very hard problems to sovle from different domains. Some are actually pretty small, say a few thousand variables/constraints. IMHO what made hard problems difficult to solve is actually the 'intneral structure' of the problems. And modern industry solvers all have a lot of built-in heurstics to take advantages of the structures, i.e., what kind of cuts, presolve/diving/branching strategy to apply, how to get the bounds ASAP. Interestinglly at some point some folks even tried using machine learning to predict strategies. Didn't work quite well back then (10+ years ago). There was some work of using seq2seq for MIP (pointer network, I think) a few years ago; worked OK. So I'm really looking forward to some breakthroughs by LLM.

E.g., do you assume that the optimal value is the one produced by the non-integer LP? reply tomas789 2 hours agorootparentIt is called duality. For each linear program that is maximizing, you can find a dual linear program wich is minimization. They both have the same optimal objective value. Thus one serves as a lower bound and the other as an upper bound on the optimal objective value. The gap between them is used to measure the closeness to the global optima. Great thing is that you can find the dual really easily and each feasible solution of the primal problem can be used to get a feasible solution of the dual. The math behind that is really neat. reply thargor90 4 hours agorootparentprevLPs can prove optimality of a result but sometimes this is to expensive and you stop as soon as you reach near optimality based on known bounds. For several problems you can prove lower and/or upper bounds for the optimal results. For example you can prove that a route between two points may not be shorter than their distance. If you use LP in production you often don't care about optimality and can work with suboptimal results very well. Worst case you stop after a timeout and just pick the best result. Edit: I forgot to mention that during solving of a LP you usually get dynamically computed bounds. The branch and bounds algorithm works by computing bounds on relaxed problems that give upper bounds for the original problem. reply kragen 12 hours agoprevthis is a pretty good overview; it's unfortunate that they omitted linear from the title of the article, because it's pretty crucial my notes on the landscape five years ago: https://dercuano.github.io/notes/linear-optimization-landsca... reply unnah 6 hours agoparentThe optimization solver landscape changes slow enough that a 5 year old overview it is still very relevant.

Surprisingly, it is slightly older than Org-mode – although it now works great with Org files – and is still actively maintained by the author. After giving it a try, I now feel that I prefer it’s simplicity over newer systems like Org Roam and Denote, while having some similarities to e.g. Deft (like fulltext as-you-type search). It also offers some unique features of its own, like “comefrom links” as opposed to conventional “goto links”, and that most Howm links are actually just syntactic sugar for searches.

Japanese “engineering” at its best, so to speak. As Howm has become such an important part of my everyday digital life, I will certainly write my own blog article about it one day.

(setq howm-file-name-format \"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S.org\") (setq howm-view-title-header \"*\") (setq howm-dtime-format (format \"\" (cdr org-timestamp-formats))) ;; Use ripgrep for fast searching.

(\"\" . howm-list-all) (\"\" . howm-create) :config ;; Where to store data. (setq howm-directory \"~/Documents/wiki\") (setq howm-home-directory howm-directory))) The way I use it is that Ctrl+F12 captures a new note. Once you have a few notes, press F12 to browse them – in that mode, you can press n/p/RET to preview and open notes, s to search through headings, g to (rip)grep through the full text of notes, S to sort the hits, or c to create another new note from that mode. (I largely ignore Howm's default \"menu buffer\" in favor of the \"list all\" buffer.) Note that you can make the titles and dates even more Org-compatible: (setq howm-view-title-header \"#+title: \") (setq howm-dtime-format (format \"#+date: \" (cdr org-timestamp-formats))) After trying both, I prefer the system above, since Howm supports multiple titles in a single file which maps better to Org headings. Plus, this makes the F12 menu quite a bit cleaner... (You can still manually add titles and dates in the Org format before exporting the note, Howm doesn't mind that.) reply lycopodiopsida 10 hours agoparentprevI've skimmed through the manual - it seems to be quite more complex than Denote. Denote is very simple, I've had basically to configure my own fuzzy search with consult-notes-search to make it work. Howm has all that out of the box. The appeal is lack of configuration, I guess, but I can already see that there are things I would never touch - a skinny org-agenda replacement is not very appealing these days. I guess it really predates the existence of org. reply setopt 9 hours agorootparentI feel that it’s a different type of simplicity: Denote is simple and well-designed, but I personally found it a hassle to actually organize things in it. For instance, to actually find again my content when I need it, I find that it’s important to design a good set of tags and actively apply them. Howm is more designed around making it as hassle-free as possible to input notes, and then let the notes surface in a “self-organizing” way. For instance, it’s easy to discover “sibling notes” that link to the same thing as this one (just click any link in the current note and all siblings pop up in a search buffer, below the note that you’re actually linking to). Or you can use “comefrom links”, where you in some other file type “ links are actually just syntactic sugar for searches. I don't emacs, but the usual problem with that is that searches are very fragile and hard to analyze. How does this deal with searches that, over time, can change to return 0 or 2+ results? reply setopt 11 hours agorootparentHowm has a simple solution for this: Links like “>>> this thing” searches for “this thing” and opens a search buffer. The top hit is already marked, shown in a preview window below, and can be opened by clicking enter. But if you want a different result, you just navigate that search buffer to find the hit you want. The search triggered by a link is sorted such that it shows first “comefrom links” (if any file has said explicitly said that “these keywords should lead here”), then headline results (files where your phrase is in the note title), then siblings (other notes that link to the same keywords), then fulltext search matches (any file that just contains those words). So if you have 0 results with those keywords in the title after renaming a note, you might still find the note again via full-text search hits below. If you have 2+ results, just navigate between them with the arrow keys while previewing their contents, and open the one you want. This design is intentional: The author advocates to “write fragmentarily, read collectively”; so instead of refinding an old note and adding to it, you can make a new note with a similar title where you capture new info, and then links will point to both notes from now on. (In most cases, if their titles are similar, the contents are likely relevant in the same situations as well.) With that said, Howm supports exact links as well: You can link to a file path instead of a title. Since Howm defaults to putting just the creation datetime in the note filename, the filename is by default like an immutable-ish UUID, and such links should remain exact as long as you don’t manually move or remove a file. By default, Howm creates such links in one context: If you create a note (C-c , c) while inside another note, it saves an exact back link to where you came from so you can remember your “inspiration”. But you are of course free to use such links everywhere instead of the “fuzzy links” above if you prefer. reply CurrentB 5 hours agoprevI know this probably isn't the best place for a bug report/help request, but this seems cool, and the alternative to asking here, now, realistically is that I just forget about this I'm trying howm on emacs 29.4 I try (with my config and also with emacs -Q) (use-package howm) I enter `C-c , ,` I see the howm-memu pop up, but it's all plaintext with no font highlighting/decoration/\"links\" or anything, and I get in the Messages log: font-lock-fontify-keywords-region: Symbol’s function definition is void: nil Error during redisplay: (jit-lock-function 5328) signaled (void-function nil) Is this familiar to anyone? reply setopt 4 hours agoparentStrange.

I used to use Org-Roam in Emacs, but fell in love with Logseq [0], primarily because 1. it has a \"daily journal\" default workflow (though individual pages are supported) 2. the support of datalog queries 3. templates This basically allows me to make templates for things I need (e.g. meeting notes, etc) and to write a few key queries (that are also templated for reuse) to do things like get the most overdue tasks, upcoming, things I promised to others, things I'm waiting on, etc. I can even drill down and get that stuff for an individual \"page\", e.g. \"Emacs\" or \"C++\". The lack of a \"lab journal\" format + flexible queries makes going back to other solutions not as enticing, as the \"perfect artifact\" of wiki-esque editing (and not being able to easily see backlinks) is not as easy. I can open my Logseq folder, make a \"meeting\" template, then #tag the people and topics discussed, and be able to go back later and make a query to see when I discussed #topic with #person. I would love to move this back into Emacs, as I hate having a separate tool for PKM, so if anyone has a similar workflow (or at least flexible queries on \"tags\" and task status, backlinks, etc, even without the daily journal thing), I'd be grateful for any tips.

I also got into the habit of writing everything in the daily journal (with things like [[emacs]] in each top-level bullet so that I could read it under the Emacs page). I tried replicating this workflow in other system, including Obsidian and Org Roam and Denote which all support back links and journals – it works but it wasn’t as smooth as Logseq’s transclusion. Currently, I’m using Howm, and am quite happy with that. Its motto is “write fragmentarily and read collectively”, which summarizes well what I liked about Logseq. It’s however a slightly different workflow: I launch “howm-list-all” (I bind it to F12) to see a list of all notes, which I use similarly to Logseq’s journal. To read recent entries, use arrow keys or n/p to move between recent notes (which I use like top-level bullets in the Logseq journal), which are instantly previewed in a pane below. Or press “c” (create) to create a new note, which is automatically date stamped. Whenever I in Logseq would create a new top-level journal bullet, I in Howm create a new datestamped Org file. For sub-bullets I use Org outlining. But it largely has the same feel to me as Logseq’s journal system although it maps to different files on disk. Instead of Logseq hashtags, I use Howm’s comefrom links. So say I am working on a project called “Foo Bar”. In Logseq, I’d type [[Foo Bar]] in my journal every time I think about that project. In Howm, I’d make a new note that contains a Howm link of the form “ If you don’t organize notes, it’s wearisome to read them. > If you try to organize notes, it’s wearisome to write them. > The need of trade-off is worrisome. “Wearisome” is an important keyword.

Every month or so, somebody will come up with a great idea for a new field to put in the database. You get all kinds of clever ideas, for example, keeping track of the file where the bug was found; keeping track of what % of the time the bug is reproducible; keeping track of how many times the bug occurred; keeping track of which exact versions of which DLLs were installed on the machine where the bug happened. It’s very important not to give in to these ideas. If you do, your new bug entry screen will end up with a thousand fields that you need to supply, and nobody will want to input bug reports any more. For the bug database to work, everybody needs to use it, and if entering bugs “formally” is too much work, people will go around the bug database. — Joel Spolsky, Painless Bug Tracking, 2000:reply wiz21c 11 hours agoprevDear Lazyweb, what I miss the most is the ability to drag/drop pictures into my notes.

At my (small but slowly growing) company, we use a git repository with a bunch of org files as our wiki. It works OK, but I can't see that grow very much. Also not particularly excited about moving to another tool though, org-mode is neat. If anyone figured out a better way to collaborate on a bunch of org files in a team, I'd love to hear about it! reply paulv 16 hours agoparentI think the web interface for the gollum wiki (which used to power GitHub wikis, but I think they have diverged) supports org mode files. https://github.com/gollum/gollum reply fhd2 13 hours agorootparentThat looks pretty spot on, thank you! reply SoftTalker 17 hours agoparentprevGit (or a verson control system) actually sounds pretty ideal. That is their main use case: collaborating on a bunch of files in a team. What about it isn't working? Git scales to huge numbers of contributors easily. reply fhd2 13 hours agorootparentWell, for one, it's a bit of a hassle. Constantly thinking of commit messages and stuff, but maybe I'm overly dramatic there. On top of that, it would be nice to at least navigate the contents read-only without Emacs. We use GitLab, it does render org files, but not even links to other files work. reply setopt 11 hours agorootparentFor read-only access, I’ve heard that Hugo can be used with Org. It’s perhaps more used for blogs than wikis, but it should give you a clean and lightweight website of linked HTML files generated from the Org files, which might be sufficient. Presumably, this can be integrated with Gitlab CI to regenerate the website on push. I guess one question though is how this will scale as the company grows, assuming that more non-Emacs users might join the team after a while? reply fhd2 8 hours agorootparentYeah exactly, it's a bit like chasing a local maximum. The sibling suggestion, gollum, looks very promising for this, a git backed web based wiki with org support. reply shrubble 21 hours agoprevI use this and it is fantastic for my use case as well; I use Syncthing to sync it (just a directory with other directories and files) across multiple systems so I always have the latest notes/todos wherever I am. reply dustfinger 20 hours agoprevHow does Howm compare to org brain? especially in terms of scalability. reply setopt 10 hours agoparentI haven’t really stress-tested it, but I would imagine that it scales well since (I) it can be configured to use Ripgrep to resolve searches and “goto links”, and (II) the “comefrom links” are cached on save. I haven’t used org-brain though, so it’s hard to compare :) reply nyc111 3 hours agoprev [–] Thanks for posting this. I downloaded and was playing with it. But I'm puzzled about new note creation. When I type in the title next to the equal sign, I need to move the cursor below the date line to compose the note. Shouldn't the date line be on top? reply setopt 3 hours agoparent [–] What I personally do is to first type the title, then press either M-> or END to jump to the end of the buffer, and then just keep typing from there. You can however place the date above the title if you want: (setq howm-view-title-header \"*\") (setq howm-template \"%date %file* %title%cursor\") By adjusting the new file template, you can type the title and then just press enter and keep typing the content from there. Howm still understands where the title of the note is, since it looks for the first title header. (If you like the default equal signs, you can skip the first setq above and replace \"*\" with \"=\" in the template.) reply nyc111 1 hour agorootparent [–] Thanks, this was helpful. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

(In the case of AV1 I think they eventually gave up and started offering dav1d on Android, but not before shipping their in-house implementation that was much less efficient and no safer than state of the art, perplexing everyone in the process.) reply lifthrasiir 7 hours agorootparentIt should be noted that all known independent JPEG XL decoders (especially my J40 [1] and jxl-oxide) were primarily written by a single individual for each library. So the request is that some library, either the future version of jxl-oxide or Rust rewrite of libjxl or something else, should be written in a provably memory-safe manner, actively maintained by JPEG XL developers, and successfully reproducing the original libjxl's decoding performance. I think it is indeed a fair deal to both Mozilla and JPEG XL developers. [1] The main blocker for J40 was that I don't really want to keep it less safe than I hope to achieve, but I also want to keep it in C for practical reasons. This and my daily job prevented any significant improvements so far. reply lifthrasiir 8 hours agoparentprevFor one thing, I believe jxl-oxide is not yet performant enough to replace libjxl's decoder (not necessarily because of a difference between C++ and Rust, however). reply Timshel 8 hours agoparentprevThey are relatively neutral about the format, so I'm guessing they want a commitment from Google to maintain it. As good as Oxide might be it looks like a one developer project. reply noobermin 7 hours agoparentprevMay be deep down somewhere a large motivation for coding in rust is to invent something here even if that includes reinvention. The memory safety is a by-product. reply pornel 7 hours agoparentprevI think it would make more sense to support the existing implementation than to start yet another one. As for why jxl-oxide can't be used yet — it just isn't mature enough yet. They're still finding unimplemented or incompatible features, and have some unoptimized code. JPEG XL is big and complex – it is designed to have every feature of every competing codec (from vector graphics to video), and beat them all on compression in every case, so it's a half a dozen of different codecs in a trench coat. reply JyrkiAlakuijala 6 hours agorootparentI believe that analysis is unfair or imprecise libjxl decoder is 3-5x smaller in binary and 10x smaller in specification text size than an avif decoder reply noobermin 7 hours agorootparentprevWhy start from zero then if jpeg xl is big and complex? reply justmarc 8 hours agoprevWhy just consider? Hell yes. Anything that has remotely something to do with user-supplied data should be done in Rust, especially for such a high profile piece of software. reply Omin 7 hours agoparentThey are not on the fence about Rust. They are on the fence about JPEG-XL when it entails a major increase in attack surface due to the current implementation being in C++. reply johnisgood 6 hours agoparentprevOr Ada / SPARK which is widely used in production for critical-systems. reply amelius 8 hours agoparentprevRust adds a lot of complexity (a new language) and does not even offer a general approach to automated correctness verification (not saying that C++ is better in this regard). Maybe it is just better to wait for Rust++. reply pornel 7 hours agorootparentRust is much better suited to static analysis and formal verification than C++, primarily thanks to stricter pointer aliasing, immutability without loopholes of const, and thread safety annotations in the type system. Most things that are advanced correctness verification in C++ are regular compiler errors in Rust. reply SahAssar 8 hours agorootparentprevRust is already in the firefox codebase (hell, it was basically invented to be used in firefox) so it doesn't add any complexity. reply dwattttt 8 hours agorootparentprevRust is not a new language for Firefox, some of Firefox is already written in Rust. reply hencoappel 9 hours agoprev> 100k lines of multithreaded C++ Just for a JPEG library. Damn! reply bdemirkir 8 hours agoparentI don't know where that line count comes from. It looks like libjxl has 38314 lines (https://app.codecov.io/gh/libjxl/libjxl/tree/main/lib%2Fjxl) at the moment. reply JyrkiAlakuijala 6 hours agorootparentand that 38 kloc includes the encoder, psychovisual model, etc. etc. that are not needed for the decoder current decoder is around 20 kloc reply lifthrasiir 6 hours agorootparentI think Highway is a critical component for libjxl and has to be counted towards the line count. (CMS can be ignored here, and any Rust implementation should ideally use qcms [1] which is already in use in Firefox anyway.) [1] https://github.com/FirefoxGraphics/qcms reply JyrkiAlakuijala 5 hours agorootparentPersonally, I'm on the edge on this one. I think both viewpoints are valid. One way to think of Highway is that it is portable multi-platform SIMD intrinsics for C++. While we developed it originally as a part of JPEG XL, it has long ago graduated into a general-purpose library that has various uses, including the recent Gemma.cpp ML launch. Other modern highway uses include: Audio, Browsers, Computational biology, Computer graphics, Cryptography, Grok JPEG 2000, JPEGenc, Jpegli, OpenHTJ2K, Image processing, Image viewers, Information retrieval, Machine learning, Numpy, and Robotics... (copied from: https://github.com/google/highway) I derived the name from the CityHash, FarmHash, and then HighwayHash series, and considered that Highway would link this library to its roots in the HighwayHash (of course much is also based on Jan's previous work with SIMD). Notably, I resisted using the -li naming here :-D reply janwas 5 hours agorootparentprevIndeed, though Highway is approaching a system library at this point. It is also a thin wrapper over the compiler's intrinsics headers: e.g. ~16KLOC for arm_neon.h, times the number of targets. That's a lot of code, but it is not comparable with actual codec logic lines. reply thrdbndndn 9 hours agoparentprevI'm also surprised by this number. Granted it's not just old JPEG standard, still 100k sounds like a lot for a decoder. reply pixelesque 8 hours agorootparentIt's the encoder as well, plus converter code for things like JPEG reading as well, and JPEG XL supports animation... reply thrdbndndn 3 hours agorootparentI guess the original comment in TFA is a little bit misleading, then. > of the reference decoder (currently behind a pref in Firefox Nightly), which weighs in at more than 100,000 lines of multithreaded C++ reply lonjil 6 hours agorootparentprevThat number includes all the different extra tools in the repo, and all tests. And as mentioned, the encoder. reply archerx 8 hours agorootparentprevThere must be a lot of edge cases that were discovered over the years. reply pornel 7 hours agoprevThis is a great news for JPEG XL. Web standards need two independent implementations of every feature – this proves that the spec is actually possible to implement, and makes it possible to verify that the implementations are interoperable. It makes uses in the wild much less likely to depend on bugs in a particular implementation, which makes it possible to upgrade or replace implementations without creating bug-compatibility problems. reply JyrkiAlakuijala 6 hours agoparentI believe that there are already several decoder implementations that pass the ISO conformance test for JPEG XL. I don't remember which one's exactly but I believe at least both jxl-oxide and libjxl do. reply joshlk 7 hours agoparentprevI’m not sure this holds as true if it’s the same team creating both implementations. reply pornel 7 hours agorootparentIt's sufficient. Another implementation is still unlikely to have the exact same bugs. Especially rewrite in Rust will force the code to be structured differently (Rust is very opinionated about that). The spec is big enough that the team won't be able to just write the exact same implementation from memory. reply pogue 6 hours agoprevCan someone summarize why JPEG-XL is so controversial to browser devs? Why not just allow as many image standards as possible? reply rowbin 6 hours agoparentBecause of the increased attack surface and maintenance burden. Which is totally understandable. But JPEG-XL should really be supported... reply Timber-6539 8 hours agoprevWhat does Google get out of this? reply mikl 8 hours agoparentA more efficient image format helps everyone on the web. We’re looking at 30-50% fewer bits sent over the wire for the same image quality. Massive bandwith savings for everyone. JPEG-XL is basically a better version of what Google was already trying to do with WebP, and a suitable long-term replacement for all image formats currently in use. reply out_of_protocol 7 hours agoparentprev* much faster decoder/encoder than avif * Much better quality at high bpp (avif performs better at high compression levels, means shitty quality images can be much smaller, while high quality images either don't compress well or loose quality a lot) * Best in class lossless compression, to replace png * Progressive encoding * Ability to losslessly reconvert existing jpegs for 20% free gains reply JyrkiAlakuijala 6 hours agorootparentgreat analysis and summary of the JPEG XL benefits! reply maeln 7 hours agoparentprevGoogle Research (which, if I remember correctly had member working on jxl spec and did reference implementation) has much more freedom, and has already been cleared to work on jxl, than the Chrome Team. They also don't have the same goal. Google Research is also responsible for Brotli and Snappy I believe. For all we know, JXL might be super useful, and is actively being used, for some project at Google for X, Y, and Z reasons, but the Chrome team doesn't want to add it to the browser for A, B, and C reasons. Google does many thing. reply greener_grass 8 hours agoparentprevThey have a general interest in the quality of the web. More web use is good for Google Ads. This sometimes comes into tension with Google's attempts to control and monetize the web. reply arp242 8 hours agorootparentAnd at \"Google scale\" shaving off a few bytes on every request means saving real money. reply rapsey 8 hours agorootparentDoes bandwidth actually cost Google anything? reply Hendrikto 7 hours agorootparentAt the datacenter scale, bandwidth is expensive, yes. reply throw0101c 7 hours agorootparentprev> Does bandwidth actually cost Google anything? Latency can cost monetization. Fewer bits at X b/s is fewer seconds. reply arp242 6 hours agorootparentprevIt's not free, no. And servers aren't free either. At \"Google scale\" 1% or 2% savings can add up to hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars per year. 1% of 100,000 servers is 1,000 servers. reply BoingBoomTschak 8 hours agoprevReminder that https://github.com/google/wuffs exists too. reply lifthrasiir 7 hours agoparentIt will be fairly challenging to rewrite libjxl or any other independent JPEG XL decoder into wuffs, due to its inherent (and for now necessary) limitations. Even its PNG decoder is not very traditional, and JPEG XL has way more bookkeeping in its format. reply BoingBoomTschak 6 hours agorootparentYeah, probably, just thought it worth mentioning since it was literally made by Google for use within Chromium. reply timeon 5 hours agorootparentI'm already covered by rust, but thanks for the link it is interesting.

So not only it is on by default, but it also requires a couple of config entries to disable. reply pshirshov 5 hours agorootparentStill, if you are unhappy with it, you have a way to opt out. Unlike in many other cases. reply leduyquang753 7 hours agoprevThat sentiment is just so unnecessary but oh well Rust is literally their brain child so. reply rapsey 7 hours agoparentLibpng and libjpeg have been huge sources oh high severity security vulnerabilities. It is not unnecessary at all. reply kookamamie 8 hours agoprev [–] > mozilla locked as too heated and limited conversation to collaborators. I wonder which one was objected to - the implementation considered to be in Rust or that a rewrite might not actually make sense for the dying browser (2.75% share) at this stage? reply lost_womble 8 hours agoparent [–] Firefox is around 8% of market share in the US on non-mobile devices -- up from around 4.5% this time last year. It's downright wrong to see 80% increase in users over 12 months as 'dying' -- and in general 1 in 12 users is significant enough that you should be caring about it. reply Y_Y 6 hours agorootparent [–] Commenters seen to love declaring things to be dying, and marketshare trends are only tangentially related. (see e.g. \"Netcraft confirms it\" meme) I personally feel like softeare is dead once it is no longer useful, and there is no likelihood of that changing in the foreseeable future. That's obviously not the case woth Firefox. On the other hand I've seen exaggerated reports of the demise of a project that hasn't had a git commit in the last week, or isn't commercially relevant for whatever the commenter is interested in. Even this doesn't seem to me to be true for Firefox, but I don't think the accusations will stop, or the signal-to-noise will increase. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Cry Me AI River OpenAI Pleads That It Can’t Make Money Without Using Copyrighted Materials for Free byNoor Al-Sibai \"It would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials.\" Jan 8, 2:29 PM EST Mike Coppola/Getty Images for TIME \"It would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials.\" Please Sir OpenAI is begging the British Parliament to allow it to use copyrighted works because it's supposedly \"impossible\" for the company to train its artificial intelligence models — and continue growing its multi-billion-dollar business — without them. As The Telegraph reports, the AI firm said in a filing submitted to a House of Lords subcommittee that using only content from the public domain would be insufficient to train the kind of large language models (LLMs) it's building, suggesting that the company must therefore be allowed to use copyrighted material. \"Because copyright today covers virtually every sort of human expression — including blog posts, photographs, forum posts, scraps of software code, and government documents — it would be impossible to train today's leading AI models without using copyrighted materials,\" the company wrote in the evidence filing. \"Limiting training data to public domain books and drawings created more than a century ago might yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today's citizens.\" OpenAI went on to insist in the document, submitted before the House of Lords' communications and digital committee, that it complies with copyright laws and that the company believes \"legally copyright law does not forbid training.\" Rank and File There's a growing chorus of interested parties who strongly disagree with OpenAI's assertion that it's chill and legal to use copyrighted work to train AI. Just a few weeks ago, the New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft, its biggest investor, for profiting from allegedly \"massive copyright infringement, commercial exploitation and misappropriation\" of the paper's intellectual property. The paper of record is far from alone in its legal overtures against OpenAI. A few months prior, the Authors Guild sued the firm on behalf of some of the biggest names in fiction — including John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, Jonathan Franzen, David Baldacci, and George R.R. Martin — over objections to those writers' work being used to train ChatGPT. Without using copyrighted work, OpenAI \"would have a vastly different commercial product,\" Rachel Geman, one of the attorneys in the guild's class action suit, said in a press release about the filing. As such, the company's \"decision to copy authors' works, done without offering any choices or providing any compensation, threatens the role and livelihood of writers as a whole.\" On OpenAI's end, the company claims that it's seeking to broker new publisher partnerships, The Telegraph reports. All the same, it's hard to imagine every newspaper, website, or publishing house accepting such terms wholesale, much less independent writers who rely on their copyrights to make a living.

What they could have done was stayed as an open research org when the tech started to work, and focused on sample efficiency and cultivating copyright free data sets. But they were too impatient to commercialize. Whoops. I don’t actually think intellectual property restrictions are good, but I don’t want a world where small creators have their rights stomped on by multi billion dollar corporations. Either we have copyright or we don’t, but unless OpenAI is also going to give up their copyrights this seems deeply unfair. reply lumost 22 hours agoparentIf the model weights are distributed, or its a free forever product... Fair use seems like a solid claim for LLMs in my semi-informed opinion. It seems like it will be a tall leap to create a trillion dollar corporation as fair use. It would be unsurprising to me if OpenAI directly purchased copyright holding firms for the purpose of acquiring access rights to their material. reply kranke155 22 hours agorootparentThey’re doing licensing deals left and right. reply lumost 5 hours agorootparentLicensing means recurring payment, why not buy elsevier outright? reply AlienRobot 22 hours agorootparentprevI don't think fair use applies at all. First, it may not even be a thing in some countries. Second, I can't upload the bee movie on Youtube for free and claim fair use. One key consideration in fair use is whether your use of the copyright work competes with the author. It's why you can take a screenshot of a GUI (which is copyrightable) without worries since nobody is going to be like \"I don't need to purchase Affinity Photo because I found a screenshot on the Internet for free.\" In the case of AI, several whole classes of artists are vehemently and justifiably complaining that it will take their jobs. It would be like saying photobashing is fair use, or collages are fair use. reply ronsor 21 hours agorootparent> First, it may not even be a thing in some countries. It doesn't matter as long as it's a thing in the country where the training occurs. reply AlienRobot 18 hours agorootparentThat doesn't sound right to me? If I use an AI trained in a way that is illegal in my country, the fact it was trained elsewhere shouldn't mean anything. If it meant, that is just an easy way to skirt the law. reply aziaziazi 9 hours agorootparentExactly. Imagine a law become hostile to openAI and they decide to relocate to offshore legal paradise, still selling they services in the rest of the world because \"they respect the law in their country\". We ban, embargos and tax countries for political reasons. Human right violation , copyright disregard or tax evasion ? Free business should be tall free ! reply threatofrain 21 hours agoparentprevWe're talking about UK law here, so is it a settled question as to whether or not OpenAI is violating copyright? In the US there was a recent high profile challenge that was largely dismissed with prejudice. There's the descriptive question over whether something is a copyright violation today and there's the prescriptive question over what kind of policies we'd like. Does anyone with more intimate knowledge of this area of law care to comment? reply bb88 20 hours agorootparentSearch engines wouldn't work without the fair use doctrine, period. Otherwise a google search would be something like hundreds of thousands of dollars of copyright violations per search. OpenAI doesn't seem to do anything different than Google. They can own a private library of copyrighted works and index/model it how ever they choose. They can offer products on that index/model in creative ways. And AFAICT, they don't distribute the index/model nor the raw training set to others. Now artists may not like it, and we as a society may not like it, but it looks like they're not doing anything illegal. And to be fair, a court would have to slice the baby super thin here to allow Google to do their indexing, but not OpenAI. reply bathtub365 20 hours agorootparentSearch engines drive traffic to websites. ChatGPT takes their content and sells it to people without paying the original creator reply threatofrain 20 hours agorootparentDoes ChatGPT just copy content and resell it? If it were that simple then there wouldn't be much debate and existing copyright law would be sufficient to settle the question.

Yes. Oodles of lawsuits claiming as such https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-lawsuit-copyrighted-d.... But yes the crux of it is financial and not algorithmic. Google ALSO uses AI.

But from a copyright standpoint, unless it regurgitates training data which is rare and only happens with a specific prefix, LLMs should be safe. They are decomposing, recombining, and regenerating language, not copying it. They execute user commands, not imitating any author on purpose. Say you want to read Harry Potter without paying, would you rather borrow a book or ask chatGPT to regurgitate the original? It would never work well, and be slower and more expensive to use AI. It's not a tool for infringement, it will naturally hallucinate and degrade the original, it can't possibly store a perfect copy of everything it trains on. In fact LLMs often use 15T tokens for 15B models, so 1000:1 compression ratio, while diffusion models compress 5B text-image pairs into less than 5GB model, so they hold about 1 byte worth of information from each training example if averaged out.

The argument in that case was that Google did that not in order to copy and distribute books, but rather to provide search and indexing of certain words within the text. It was important that it wasn't for the same purpose as the original works. There were also limitations on the amount that would be shown. In the case of LLM training, it's for the same purpose as the source material -- to generate code, or writing, or photographs, etc. Not only that, but in several instances it's been shown to reproduce source material, which is either derivative work or straight copying, depending.

The \"all art is derivative\" line is essentially something people try to convince others of to justify breaking copyright law. It's not grounded in reality or law. It devalues creative work by implying the machine, with no lived experiences, is doing the same thing. And it's also completely wrong about what the specific term derivative work actually means in the context of copyright. Derivative works deal in specific. If your LLM reproduces a substantial portion of the story beats from Jurassic Park, you can bet it'd wind up in court. If it reuses identifiable characters, that is usually gonna be derivative unless it can otherwise qualify under an exemption. \"But fanfic, fanart, etc.\" Is a common counterpoint but misses the commerce aspect of it. Here Open AI and similar are offering paid services based upon harvesting all of this information. When they produce for you the response to the prompt, they are, effectively, distributing that to you for money. That's the point at which it becomes a problem. As an aside, it's an act of drinking the LLM Kool-Aid to believe it can be \"inspired\". > Alleging that AI models can reproduce some works verbatim is probably the stronger argument, but AFAIK you have to coax them pretty hard to do so, and therefore AI companies might be able to argue they're tools like photocopiers or such.

It does. Just because you can commission art from someone doesn't mean you won't get sued if you start trying to use it as the logo for your business. If you put Foghorn Leghorn on the logo of your chicken business, you'll be sued. Having an artist simply make you a logo like that on commission, if not transformative, could get them sued, though by doing it on commission the terms likely mean the requestor is the one who's liable Earlier I noted clean room implementations.

It's a lot of work to emphasis that the impact on the market (in other words, the fourth factor) is as minimal as practicable--and that's the crux of the analysis. When you're instead scanning someone's stock image database to build a tool to generate stock images... the fourth factor is jumping up and down screaming at you \"YOU LOSE\" and your best defense is that it's not the training, it's the tool built on the training data that is infringing the copyright. reply colonelspace 21 hours agorootparentprevI don't see why it would qualify as fair use.

I'm pretty sure if I traced his work and passed it off as my own, just with maybe a few tweaks, I'd get in some kind of trouble with someone. And in my opinion (which is unfortunately more controversial than I think it should be) what LLMs do is far more akin to tracing than inspired creative expression. And I think intent is relevant here. Someone using an LLM to create a product in Frank Miller's style, trained on Frank Miller's work, isn't merely trying to create something inspired by his style, so much as create a Frank Miller product without having to pay Frank Miller. reply gruez 14 hours agorootparent>I'd get in some kind of trouble with someone. \"trouble\" of what nature?

Copyright is a regime to grant monopoly over a specific work, it's not a regime to prevent competition from others in general. reply stillold 20 hours agorootparentThere is an interesting argument here. If Google was selling brand new books created only by taking snippets from other books, that would also fall under fair use? reply gruez 14 hours agorootparentThey would, but openai isn't explicitly doing that either. You can probably smuggle a full copy of a book via snippets, but that doesn't put google on the hook for copyright infringement. Likewise if openai makes you jump through hoops to produce works verbatim they should be in the clear. reply krapp 18 hours agorootparentprevI would assume that Google's use counts as fair use precisely because they are only providing snippets in the context of a search utility which doesn't provide a market substitute for the original product, whereas the business model of AI is to provide market substitutes based on the original product. reply gruez 14 hours agorootparentProviding a snippet arguably is a substitute of the original product in some contexts.

The law in most western countries is very clear that book covers are \"entire\" works of art, and can only be displayed by organisations that pay the copyright holders. Google, Bing, and others violate copyright on a mass scale on a daily basis. Not to mention YouTube, TikTok, and Reels, all of which are packed wall-to-wall with \"movie clips\" and \"TV show highlights\".

Instead, they ignored it all and it's the 'what-if' scenario of when open source software was first being introduced. I'm old enough to remember everyone saying \"well companies will just take your work and sell it for themselves.\" This happed a few times, and its been fought out in the court. Infact so has production data like written articles, videos etc, there is a fair-use clause.

If I describe something that is objectively true for the first time, it was simply there and I noticed it. I expect anyone who would like to, to notice it as well and build on it that observation with their own observations. In other words if I show the earth is \"round\" then I didn't create that fact. It simply was. What I mean by things that I've created, I mean that I've literally brought into the world. A novel, a photograph, some code. Those things did not already exist, but only came about due to my thoughts and work.

By advocating for excluding copyrighted works from LLM training, you are advocating an expansion of copyright protection.

Regardless, the old hacker ethos was very much about individuals creating and disseminating knowledge to empower other individuals, copyright was derided when it got in the way of that. What does OpenAI do? It uses knowledge to disempower the individuals holding it and sharing it, and giving it to themselves to sell to companies and create power dynamics that are extremely un-hacker-like.

The library paid for a copy of the book, so did millions of others. In the example you gave, it would be the equivalent to you getting a job, working hard to produce something, and get nothing in return. reply crazygringo 19 hours agorootparentWhat are you expecting the people who write the books to get? Do you agree that if an author sold 43,958 copies, then it's fine for OpenAI to purchase one, so that the author sold 43,959? But also fine for OpenAI to ingest scanned used copies that are loaned to it? The same way it's fine for me to read a friend's book, or all of a friend's books, that they loan me, and the author doesn't get anything additional? The same way it's fine for me to go the library and the author doesn't get paid anything extra? Or are you trying to invent some new principle where OpenAI has to pay some new ongoing fee? And if so, on what basis? (And no, my example still stands entirely. It's from the perspective of somebody who learned from books, and they are getting paid, the same way people pay OpenAI to use ChatGPT. It's not from the perspective of authors, because again -- they make no additional money when somebody goes to the library to read their book that the library already purchased.) reply bamboozled 19 hours agorootparentIt's not about what the \"author should get for their book\". It's the OpenAI benefits unfairly from using everyone's work to make nearly endless money and lobby for regulatory capture. The author should get access to the model, the weights, it should all be open source because it partly contains their work. Just like how OpenAI could outright buy a copy of the authors work. Basically, I think this is where knowledge and money are coming into an unresolveable conflict, who owns the ideas ? who owns information? OpenAI seem to be trying to have a monopoly on information, and while they seem to be failing (thankfully), it's really where the issue lies for me. reply crazygringo 14 hours agorootparentWhere are you getting this \"nearly endless money\" and \"lobby for regulatory capture\" and \"monopoly on information\"? OpenAI competes with Google competes with a bunch of other companies, and surely this is only the beginning of a ton of competition as better and better models are developed. There's no \"nearly endless money\" when there's competition and GPU training costs a fortune. The idea that all models should be open source to everyone or all content creators doesn't make any more sense than the idea that all the work I do should be open sourced to the authors of every book I've read, and every teacher I've ever had. You ask two questions that have clear answers already: > who owns the ideas? Nobody. Legally speaking there's no such thing as ownership of ideas, except in the narrow case of patents (and if you consider trademarks to be ideas). > who owns information? You can copyright a particular, exact expression of information. The author of a book owns its text; the studio behind a movie owns the image in each frame. But once you leave behind an exact expression of information, you're back in the realm of ideas, and there's no such thing as ownership of ideas. Which is why as long as ChatGPT and other models repeat ideas but not paragraphs of exact copyrighted wording, there's no legal issue. Because they're doing the same exact thing every human being does every day. reply bamboozled 14 hours agorootparentThere are about 3 companies competing for any level of serious business regarding AI.

Three companies is huge. That's the very definition of competition, the polar opposite of monopoly. > They cost a fortune for now. That won't be the way forever. Yes, and as costs come down it becomes easier for more competitors to enter the space to build all sorts of other products. Again, a good thing. It's not like the difference just turns into profit. That's not what happens in a market economy. reply bamboozled 5 hours agorootparentWhen the prices come down, it won't be a monopoly, but right now building something competitive is nearly impossible for 99% of the world. reply camgunz 19 hours agorootparentprevWriting a book about C isn't the same thing as \"write me a mail server in C\".
