    "commentBody": "If YouTube had actual channels (ytch.xyz)803 points by hadisafa 3 hours agohidepastfavorite238 comments slazaro 2 hours agoI'd echo the sentiment that this is amazing, and that a TV guide would be awesome. I'd also suggest maybe adding the channel names (like the comment you posted here) to the app itself (although i think it's cool when it's unnamed and you get the old-school feeling of channels just being numbers). Also, I'd love to have permalinks for the channels. Not for the individual videos themselves, but just a link that when sharing would bring somebody else to the same channel you're watching right now. Another thing, although probably outside your control, is that I use a Firefox extension called \"SoundFixer\" that I use to force the youtube audio to mono (since a lot of channels are annoying to me using headphones, they pan the audio sources too hard left/right and it's super distracting), but it doesn't seem to work on this website, probably because of the way they're embedded. I don't know if this can be changed somehow, or have a mode to force mono audio (which would be also oldschool like old TVs with one speaker only!). It's probably too niche and hard to do though. Also I don't seem to find any volume control except mute? reply hadisafa 2 hours agoparentThank you for the feedback, I'll see what I can do regarding the mono audio issue, and I'll try to add more features as soon as possible. reply myself248 1 hour agoparentprevYou can probably do the audio fix systemwide with EasyEffects. reply tantalor 3 hours agoprevThe best part of this is the channel doesn't pause when you flip away from it. It is always \"running\" and if you flip away you will miss it. That builds in a FOMO trade-off which causes user to automatically/subconciously decide on channel they most want to watch, because they can't watch everything. reply angry_moose 2 hours agoparentI added ErsatzTV to my Plex setup about a month ago and we honestly love it so much. I've got 2 sitcom channels, British panel shows, Taskmaster, all Star Trek all the time, British sitcoms, cartoons, and a few others. Its really nice to just sit down and watch \"whatever is on\" (even though I could switch over to the main library and watch any episode I want). Sometimes I just want a 0-effort/0-decision background noise while I work on something else or browse on my phone. reply l72 2 hours agorootparentI've also been using ErsatzTV with my jellyfin setup. It can take a while to setup channels how you want them, but I love my sci-fi channel which is going through all the Star Treks, Stargates, and Twilight Zones. It is so much easier to flip it on to my Sci-fi Channel, animation channel, movie channel, or James Bond marathon channel then to decide what to watch. And since I've seen all this content, it is often kinda nice to start in the middle of an episode. I also found a ton of old Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Adult Swim bumps that I use as some filler content if I want episodes to start on the hour. I've been thinking a lot about setting up some kids channels with specific hours (like channel comes on at 7am, goes off during part of the day, comes back on in the afternoon, and goes offline at bedtime) for my siblings kids, as I think letting them just browser youtube kids is terrible. reply lackstein 2 hours agorootparent> I also found a ton of old Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Adult Swim bumps Where were you able to find these? Recreating one of these channels has been a side project I’ve wanted to do for ages. reply l72 1 hour agorootparentI think it was mostly youtube and retrojunk.com Try searching for \"$channel bump\" Personally, I think Adult Swim had the best bumps, usually just some nice house music with a nice animation and some funny quotes. reply ChadNauseam 37 minutes agorootparentI'm really interested in this but I'm having trouble googling. What is a bump? Is it referring to this? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumper_(broadcasting) reply vundercind 2 hours agorootparentprevDo you know if that can operate with no transcoding? I’ve designed my media set-up around Jellyfin on a weak server that can’t handle transcoding, and very-capable clients that don’t need it. This lets me avoid like half the bugs on the Jellyfin bug tracker and all the instability an Nvidia or AMD video card would introduce to the server itself. I’m very interested in this, but can’t use it if it must transcode. reply l72 1 hour agorootparentNo, it must transcode to work correctly, which can be a problem for me too (although I just have an intel card and use vaapi). I believe there is a container you can use where it doesn't transcode, but it trips up every player I have tried, as they do not like having different resolutions/codecs suddenly swap. reply vundercind 1 hour agorootparentDamn, kinda what I figured. Thanks. Maybe some day I’ll upgrade/downgrade to a less perfectly-stable server that is transcoding capable. reply hadrien01 2 hours agorootparentprevI've done the same thing with dizqueTv for my grandmother. On her Android TV, I was able to integrate the IPTV channels on the same channels list, so she can simply use the remote to navigate between the digital channels and the IPTV channels (30 for Hercule Poirot, 31 for classic B&W movies, etc.) reply archon810 1 hour agorootparentdizqueTv, ErsatzTV... these are the \"Chinese company names on Amazon\" of TV app names. reply enobrev 56 minutes agorootparentprevI've been using Quasi TV (android app) to try out the concept. I remember having something similar back in the boxee / xbmc days. I especially liked that it \"just worked\" without having to set anything up besides pointing it at my plex. I'm not afraid of hosting something, but I didn't want to go through the trouble if it turned out I wasn't going to use it. I quite like it. Unfortunately, the app's been a bit buggy - not always picking up the stream at the \"current time\" and sometimes navigation gets wonky. But it was a good test run and that, along with your post, has convinced me to give Ersatz (or something like it) a try. reply A_Duck 3 hours agoparentprevYep this works really nicely, and psychologically it's somehow way more relaxing than having to curate what you watch I predict this appears as real youtube feature soon. Since it will also allow them to do a Spotify-style payola approach to scheduling. reply dotnet00 1 hour agorootparent>I predict this appears as real youtube feature soon I highly doubt it. They're going to wait for competitors to implement it and have it for several years before they bother to poorly copy the idea. reply digging 2 hours agorootparentprev> I predict this appears as real youtube feature soon. I doubt it would. The modern style of binging on-demand streaming content seems to be too effective at capturing attention. Remember that lots of people get notifications on their phone the instant a new video comes out for a subscribed channel, especially kids and teens who haven't developed resistance to these business models. YT would be unlikely to spend any effort implementing an alternate mode that doesn't capture attention as effectively; the old model of live channels is likely a niche preference. If somehow this did prove to be more effective at capturing attention, I could see it being implemented, but that would surprise me. reply teska 1 hour agorootparentprevThey experimented with it for a bit last year. I think Linus talked about it on the WAN show, and for a while LTT had it enabled on their channel. It was essentially a 24/7 livestream which played from their back catalogue, with the ability to add \"promo\" segments in between videos, which they used for products on their merch store. Seemed to dissapear around the same time the whole monoblock scandal and production shutdown happened last year, so I'm not sure if the YouTube experiment also concluded or if they turned it off during the shutdown. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 1 hour agorootparentprevI have long wanted Netflix to offer this feature. Just give me a random episode of a low stakes sitcom. Seinfeld, SVU, whatever. My other wishlist item was that Netflix would offer a “shuffle” this series option. For standalone episodic shows, ordering does not matter, and it is a bunch of overhead to pick something. reply dustincoates 58 minutes agorootparentNetflix offered this in France back in 2020[0], but appeared to have removed it in 2022[1]. 0: https://www.vulture.com/2020/11/netflix-linear-channels-dire... 1: https://www.numerama.com/pop-culture/1273686-netflix-direct-... reply saintfire 1 hour agorootparentprevI didn't realize how much I would appreciate shuffle until i started using jellyfin. I use it all the time for shows that have self-contained episodes (e.g. Futurama). reply Group_B 2 hours agorootparentprevwell they already have youtube shorts, which is kinda similar. reply bobbob1921 2 hours agorootparentI hate that if anytime I upload a short video it forces the video to YouTube shorts. Especially since I’m not making content for the public - it’s more a demo video or something to specifically send to a few people. As with so many services nowadays, I like the ability to use YouTube shorts when I want, but I hate that it’s forced upon us with no reasonable and consistent method to not use shorts at the users discretion. reply rd 1 hour agorootparentUploading horizontally or >1m should fix this? Most things or demos I send are horizontal, but I agree, the automatic shorts of vertical is annoying reply aa-jv 2 hours agorootparentprevAlong the same lines, I have a near-terabyte of videos I have downloaded from Youtube, of my own vast and multivariate interests, and having it on random, with a simple pause/next/prev-style interface, is also a compelling viewer-experience equillibrium akin to the sets of yore .. (cue Buggles..) reply hadisafa 3 hours agoparentprevchannels are synced so everyone is watching the same exact content at the same time, just like TV. reply recursive 57 minutes agoparentprevI don't see how this is a good thing. It's a totally artificial constraint. It's already impossible to watch everything on youtube. I don't want software I use to instill fear as a design goal, detached from any of the outcomes of user actions. reply TheKarateKid 55 minutes agoparentprevThe FOMO would only work if the content was exclusively available during that livestream, and not re-posted later. That being said, I think the last thing society needs is to make these platforms more addictive. The algorithms already do a good enough job of keeping us glued. reply imiric 39 minutes agoparentprevIf only we had a TiVo... reply notfed 2 hours agoparentprevAnother observation: with this setup, you essentially randomly jump into the middle of videos, skipping what is usually the most grating part of the show: the intro. In the intro to most shows/videos, there's annoying jingles, silly animations, a redundant summary of what's about to happen in an already short segment, or just useless chatter \"hey guys! it's your boy, _. welcome to my channel, remember to smash that like button, we have a great show today\". Because of all this intro bloat, I tend to jump a few minutes into most YouTube videos by default. reply tantalor 2 hours agorootparentThe only thing worse than the intro is the 2nd intro. Just get to the GD content please. reply aman2k4 3 hours agoparentprevyeah when i noticed this, it blew my mind. reply lucasoshiro 3 hours agoprevThis is something I always wonder... Something that I really miss from TV on internet content (YouTube, movie streamings and so on) is turn it on and watching what's being transmitted without thinking about what I wanna see. Three reasons: 1. Picking something to watch takes time. Sometimes I only want to see something in the 15 minutes that I'm dining alone. My meal gets cold before I start the video 2. Choosing something to watch is stressful. If I'm tired and I don't know what I want to see makes me more tired and frustrated. These are the times that I don't want the freedom to watch I want because they are the times that I don't want to think about what I want 3. The random factor of watching something that I would never watch by myself it's something that makes me go outside my bubble. I can't say how many good movies (or songs, etc) I found by that randomness I'm not against the freedom of streaming services but there are moments that I just don't want that freedom. So, thank you! reply rubslopes 2 hours agoparentI hadn't watched actual television for years. Then, in a visit to my parents house, I randomly got to watch a band in a talkshow that later became a band that I love. reply archon810 1 hour agoparentprevWhat I am really missing is a \"Play random episode\" or \"Randomize episodes\" button on TV shows. I want to just flip on Seinfeld or Family Guy and watch random episodes, not in order. Such a missed opportunity for Netflix, etc. reply ksynwa 1 hour agorootparentJellyfin has this. Very nice feature for comedy shows. reply Suppafly 2 hours agoparentprevThe solution to a lot of those is to just have a goto show that you watch. Before netflix removed The Office, that is what I always did when wanting something to watch while eating a snack on the couch or to have noise on in the background. I'd just fire up netflix and resume whatever episode it was last one. We ditched cable forever ago, but I do find that I miss just watching 15 minutes of some random show like I used to. I usually forget about it until I'm at someone's house or a doctors office and catch a snippet of some random car show or cooking show. reply lucasoshiro 2 hours agorootparent> The solution to a lot of those is to just have a goto show that you watch. Cool! I have a list of movies to watch that I write from several recommendations sources, so I can try focus in watching instead of choosing. I can't say the same about music, I'm stuck for years hearing almost the same bands, which is kinda sad... > I usually forget about it until I'm at someone's house or a doctors office and catch a snippet of some random car show or cooking show. Another good point, watching something that I don't need to pay too much attention because I don't care about the subject, but can entertain me while I do other things... Here in Brazil that kind of shows that \"we watch, we like but we don't know why\" is a recurring joke, and we have three main ones: one about farming (Globo Rural), one about fishing (Pesca Alternativa) and one about trucks (Siga Bem Caminhoneiro) reply Suppafly 2 hours agorootparent>Here in Brazil that kind of shows that \"we watch, we like but we don't know why\" is a recurring joke, and we have three main ones: one about farming (Globo Rural), one about fishing (Pesca Alternativa) and one about trucks (Siga Bem Caminhoneiro) Are those public access type shows that are meant to be somewhat educational? reply Almondsetat 3 hours agoparentprevWhy can't you pick randomly from your home page and let auto play do its thing? reply digging 2 hours agorootparentThis works pretty well for YT when it knows your preferences, but for streaming TV services like Netflix I find it's a box of chocolates full of shit. It's just going to be whatever is being \"promoted\" at the time and has the most widespread appeal, not something interesting. reply lukas099 2 hours agorootparentprevI wish my YouTube recommendations were anywhere good enough to do this. reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentAgreed, my recommendations are extremely narrow. Usually videos from the same three content creators, and ones that I've already seen or in there chronological queue that I already plan to watch. reply lucasoshiro 2 hours agorootparentprevThe recommendation algorithms suggests things that are related to what I watched before. And I still need to choose one of the options that it recommends. reply Almondsetat 2 hours agorootparentThey recently introduced an anonymous mode reply Mathnerd314 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah, for me loading the homepage and clicking the top-left video is almost an automatic reflex at this point. reply butlike 2 hours agoparentprevWHY is there not an \"I'm feeling lucky\" button for streaming services. Akin to \"give me anything,\" though, I suspect the answer is the more time spent scrolling, the less data has to be streamed over the wire, so it's cheaper. reply asveikau 3 hours agoparentprev> Sometimes I only want to see something in the 15 minutes that I'm dining alone. I think the YouTube recommendation algorithm you get from opening the app or viewing the front page is good for this. They have a lot of random content and when the algorithm gets to know you, it will suggest things of interest that can be consumed this way. reply cuanim 43 minutes agorootparentMy youtube recommendations on my laptop are just short videos(all are below 3 mins with a few exceptions ;-;) I get so much better recommendations by using youtube tv but it sucks that they don't let us switch preferences. But well results in me spending less time on youtube so a win heh reply Suppafly 2 hours agorootparentprevI have so many subscriptions on youtube that the home recommendation is actually a quicker way to find something interesting if I have limited time, since the subscriptions are full of shorts and 'reruns' now where creators try to monetize old videos in new ways. The only issue is that my youtube is the one on the main tv, so sometimes the suggestions get messed up when my kids watch. Youtube probably has a really confusing set of conflicting beliefs about who I am. reply asveikau 2 hours agorootparentMy kids mostly watch on tablets which are their own. On the TV, they have separate profiles on all the streaming apps. We don't do YouTube much on TV but when we do, I've always been sure to give them a different device that is not logged into my account. If I lend them a device to watch YouTube I usually do it in the browser in incognito. reply hadisafa 3 hours agoprevChannel 1: Science and Technology Channel 2: Travel and Events Channel 3: Food Channel 4: Architecture Channel 5: Film and Animation Channel 6: Documentaries Channel 7: Comedy Channel 8: Music Channel 9: Autos and Vehicles Channel 10: News and Politics Channel 11: UFC Channel 12: Podcasts/Interviews/Talk Shows reply dbingham 33 minutes agoparentIt'd be really awesome to have a link to the channel and video that is playing in case I want to find it later.

A channel or two of weird low-budget shows (local access). A few channels that don't come in well (static and distortion). And add some off-air \"colorbars\" sometimes. And a channel or two in a foreign language.

Currently watching the music channel (8, The Lumineers - Full Performance (Live on KEXP)). Since the author is reading here, one feature request: Please put a volume slider on it and also make a mouse wheel scroll on any part of the page change the volume. I think it's the lack of timeshift which triggers me so much, since it's a somewhat standard feature on TVs. No way to pause makes me a bit anxious. I have a bad habit of nesting YT videos, where I pause one, watch another, pause that one, watch another, when it finishes I go back to the previously paused one and so on until I end up watching the first video to the end. Theoretically you could add a per-client timeshift feature. reply colecut 1 hour agoparentIf you really like a video and want to watch it later, it displayed the video ID.

Given that they actually seem to be pretty good at recommending content to me I am mystified by why the ad selection is so awful. reply randomdata 2 hours agorootparent1. If the ad selection is too good, people will fall into the uncanny valley. They have to make it terrible enough to maintain user confidence. 2, They may not have anything better to select from. Quickly start/stop the ads a few times and it will usually (but not always) give up on showing any ad at all, which suggests to me that the available ad pool at that point in time is being exhausted. reply UncleOxidant 2 hours agorootparentprevI got a f'n Trump asking for money ad on YT last night. The algorithm should know better than to serve me something like that. reply yesco 2 hours agorootparentBut doesn't it make sense to pay for targeted political ads towards people opposed to you? The algorithm allows advertisers to do targeted advertising, and you were targeted, the subtle implication that targeted advertising would only show you \"what you want to see\" was intentional and misleading to get people on board with their attention being sold to the highest bidder. reply gwervc 2 hours agorootparentprevIf the ads are indeed just a way to push for subscriptions and you are upset or annoyed by a particular add, the algorithm is perfectly doing its job. reply dbspin 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's still trivial to block these though with a combination of uBlock Origin and Sponsorblock.

I missed the nostalgia. reply domatic1 52 minutes agoprevJust like https://80s.myretrotvs.com/ reply mozart_torte 1 minute agoprevsoo cool reply slazaro 1 hour agoprevI have an extra suggestion: Maybe some keyboard key mapping, like up/down for switching the channel. I'm imagining having this perma-running in a small PC connected to a TV and the small wireless remotes have mappings for the arrow keys and up/down for channel would be perfect for that. (maybe other mappings as well) reply smusamashah 2 hours agoprevThis is perfect. Can it be customized (with custom channels and schedules)? I was looking for exactly this to control my (and my kid's) TV habbits. My TV is only for YouTube. Everything we like watching is on Youtube. But with remote in hand, it NEVER STOPS. We (and my kid) keep jumping from one video to another. When I watched TV as a kid, I only had to be in-front of TV on a schedule. I would be doing something else in other times. THIS is the YouTube TV that I need. reply hkdobrev 2 hours agoprevhttps://www.youtube.com/tv used to be this, but they closed it down. reply petejodo 2 hours agoprevSo neat!

Much of YouTubes potential is pretty much wasted, because of the monetization policy. It permeates the platform, even if you're a \"Premium\" subscriber. Rather than optimize for \"engagement\", it would be nice, even if it was a Premium feature, to be able to say: \"I want to watch content that will help improve my health, teach me to become a better developer or \"On Friday evening, I want long format retro computing content\". reply owjofwjeofm 28 minutes agoprevvideo speed controller extension is automatically speeding up the video for me and I can't change it back on this website (due to the invisible divs covering everything I think) reply lagniappe 27 minutes agoprevHow do I disable the static effect between channel changes? reply hadisafa 23 minutes agoparentFor now you can't, but i'll be adding more features soon. reply rcarmo 1 hour agoprevThis is mesmerizing.

Is there something like this? I’ve heard of other users mentioning side projects like this. reply al_borland 3 hours agoparentFor music I setup a micro pc at my place connected to a radio transmitter. I have a music library on it and set it to shuffle. I can have normal radios around my house, tune to my station, and it’s always something I like with no commercials. I don’t have multiple stations to flip to, but that’s ok. I like the simplify of turning on a radio without having to pick what’s playing. I can also turn on multiple radios and it works just like those fancy setups for multi room music streaming at a fraction of the cost/complexity. Something like Sonos or AirPlay requires a lot to do what a radio could do decades ago. The transmitter seems pretty weak, to maintain a legal status with the FCC, so some days it works better than others. I probably need to experiment with placement or other frequencies. I’m in a pretty congested area from that perspective. I found a website that suggests the best one based on the city a user us in and just went with that. I wish there were reserved frequencies for personal use that would make home transmitters better to use. I have 0 hope for that now, but during the era of FM transmitters being popular in cars, it would have been nice if it had gotten some attention. reply zehaeva 3 hours agoparentprevThere's a project called DizqueTV[0] that lets you set up \"channels\" of media to be streamed to a Plex server, which then lets you send that onto a TV.

    "originBody": "Disney has asked a Florida court to dismiss a wrongful death lawsuit filed earlier this year regarding a woman who passed away due to anaphylaxis after a meal at Disney Springs, citing an arbitration waiver in the terms and conditions for Disney+. Disney Springs Wrongful Death Lawsuit Update According to Newsday, Disney has asked a Florida court to dismiss the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jeffrey Piccolo, husband of Kanokporn Tangsuan, a doctor at NYU Langone in New York City, who passed away after eating a meal at Raglan Road Irish Pub in Disney Springs in October 2023. Tangsuan had a severe dairy and nut allergy and informed the waitstaff at the restaurant of her dietary needs, and was “unequivocally assured” they could be accommodated. She ordered and ate the “Sure I’m Frittered” vegetarian broccoli and corn fritters, the “Scallop Forest” sea scallops appetizer, the “This Shepherd Went Vegan” entree, and a side of onion rings. After their meal, Piccolo returned to their hotel room, and Tangsuan and her mother-in-law continued to shop at Disney Springs. later that evening, Tangsuan had an acute allergic reaction in Planet Hollywood, self-administered an EpiPen, and was transported to a local hospital, where she later died. In the latest update for the Disney Springs wrongful death lawsuit, Disney cited legal language within the terms and conditions for Disney+, which “requires users to arbitrate all disputes with the company.” Disney claims Piccolo reportedly agreed to this in 2019 when signing up for a one-month free trial of the streaming service on his PlayStation console. In the May 31 motion filed to move the wrongful death lawsuit to arbitration, Disney attorneys said that the Disney+ subscriber agreement states that any dispute, except for small claims, “must be resolved by individual binding arbitration.” Disney says that similar language was agreed to by Piccolo when he used the My Disney Experience app to purchase tickets to visit EPCOT at Walt Disney World in September 2023. Tangsuan died before she and Piccolo could use the tickets. “Whether Piccolo actually reviewed the Disney terms is also immaterial,” the motion says. Arbitration is defined by the Legal Information Institute as “an alternative dispute resolution method where the parties in dispute agree to have their case heard by a qualified arbitrator out of court.” Attorneys for Piccolo called Disney’s latest motion “preposterous,” and that it’s “‘absurd’ to believe that the 153 million subscribers to the popular streaming service have waived all claims against the company and its affiliates because of language ‘buried’ within the terms and conditions,” according to Newsday. The notion that terns agreed to by a consumer when creating a Disney+ free trial account would forever bar that consumer’s right to a jury trial in any dispute with any Disney affiliate or subsidiary, is so outrageously unreasonable and unfair as to shock the judicial conscience, and this court should not enforce such an agreement. Brian Denny, Piccolo’s West Palm Beach attorney in a filing on August 2, 2024 In that same August 2 filing, attorneys for Piccolo cite that Piccolo is serving as a plaintiff in this case on behalf of his wife and her estate, not as an individual, and that his wife’s estate did not exist at the time of him signing up for a free trial of Disney+. Piccolo’s attorneys claim that Disney is “attempting to enforce an agreement that it never signed against a party who also never signed.” “This argument borders on the surreal,” said Piccolo’s attorneys in the filing. Walt Disney Parks and Resorts and their attorneys declined Newsday’s request for comment. For the latest Disney Parks news and info, follow WDW News Today on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

In the unlikely best case, they get the case dismissed, but even in the most likely case that the motion is denied, they win by wearing down their opponent who has much more limited resources and is personally affected by the case dragging out, i.e. more likely to accept a (lower) settlement than without this tactic. The only downside is a tiny bit of legal costs. Courts should be able to issue sanctions/extra damages for the use of such tactics. If using such a tactic turned the claim from \"you killed this person negligently\" to \"you killed this person negligently, then willfully tried sleazy tricks to create additional suffering for the husband\", and had the potential to double the award, companies would be much less eager to play this game. reply thih9 11 hours agoparentIn general I agree, except perhaps \"Disney can only win.\". They can lose PR; enough that the company might consider this an overall loss. Their service is hospitality and the message they're sending here is very much inhospitable. It might turn into a meme, like \"Cancel your Disney+ before visiting Disney IRL\". It might make people hesitate and/or choose a different holiday destination. Etc. reply mcherm 8 hours agorootparentYes, except this person DID cancel her Disney+. More accurately, she never signed up for it, merely ran a free trial for a month in 2019. So the only possible way to avoid this, if Disney's argument was upheld, would be to have never interacted with Disney at all in any way. reply gambiting 7 hours agorootparent>>. More accurately, she never signed up for it, merely ran a free trial for a month in 2019 It's actually not even that. The person who died had the free trial, and now Disney is being sued by her husband - and her husband has never had a Disney+ trial or any other service with such an agreement with them. So like the article says - Disney is trying to anforce an agreement that this person(the husband ) has never signed. reply jawns 6 hours agorootparentYour point is correct, but you've got it backward. It was the husband who signed up for the free trial and bought tickets to Epcot. Yet he is suing not on his own behalf, but on behalf of her estate, and she never entered into any such agreement. You can think of it this way: Disney wronged the woman who died. She is the one who is owed damages. But since she's dead, her estate is owed damages. Her husband is the administrator of her estate, and he is suing on its behalf. So whatever agreements he has entered into in his individual capacity are irrelevant. It would be like trying to force arbitration on someone because their lawyer had a Disney+ subscription. That doesn't mean that they themselves entered into an agreement with Disney. reply gambiting 6 hours agorootparentAh. Totally got it wrong then, thanks for explaining :-) reply jawns 22 minutes agorootparentSo few people are willing to say what you just said online! To applaud you, I've asked an AI to write you a limerick that honors your humility.

How much will Disney save in this one case, against the background meme of \"if you ever watch anything Disney they are free to kill you\" (that's not accurate, but memes rarely are). IMO this is lawyers finding a local maximum that is bad for the company in general. reply exe34 22 minutes agorootparentyou say it's not accurate, but that's exactly what they are claiming here. worse, the woman they killed never even had Disney+. it's like they murder somebody, but the prosecutor once had Disney+ - boom, immunity. reply 7thaccount 6 hours agorootparentprev\"Never interacting with Disney to begin with\" is now a goal of mine. I occasionally watch something on Disney+ with the kids, but it's been awhile and Netflix has been a much better value. This kind of bullying makes me even more likely to cancel. As far as their parks go, I have been extremely disappointed in the past. Six Flags may be a gross dumpster, but it's at least got a bunch of cool rides and is much cheaper. I was blown away by the mediocrity and datedness of Disney World. It's hot and humid there with no shade in the park. Who wants to sit in the sun for an hour to wait for a ride that's okay at best. I may take my kid once just so they can have that experience, but I'll probably take them someplace much better for 1/4 the cost instead. I get it that some people really enjoy the parks and movies though and that's fine (to each their own). reply shiroiushi 11 hours agorootparentprev>They can lose PR; enough that the company might consider this an overall loss. When has that ever happened? I can't think of any time when a company lost enough PR to actually significantly affects its financials, much less put it out of business. reply Rinzler89 9 hours agorootparent>When has that ever happened? I can't think of any time when a company lost enough PR to actually significantly affects its financials, much less put it out of business. Exactly. VW shortened the lifespan of millions of Europeans with their Diesel gate and their finances are still solid.

The emissions regulations that VW was cheating to get around exist for the purpose of improving air quality. The improved air quality leads to less air quality induced health problems. Which in turn leads to longer, higher quality lives for people in Europe. VW wasn't going around and directly pouring vials of poison into people's food like some kind of cartoon villain. But they absolutely were intentionally lying about the emissions of their vehicles, and those emissions absolutely have impacts to human health. reply alt227 6 hours agorootparentIts fair to say that VW intentially pushed the emissions of their vehicles over the recomended limit, which potentially affects the health of millions of people. Saying VW directly shortened the lifespan of millions is just Hyperbole. reply sjsdaiuasgdia 6 hours agorootparentIt's simply extending the line to the obvious next dot. It gets more uncomfortable to think about so we often don't want to, but what exactly do you think is the eventual outcome of those effects on the health of millions of people? Think of the many factors that combine to determine when someone dies of \"old age\" or \"natural causes\". Think of the extra effort millions of bodies have spent dealing with the pollutants directly and the effects those pollutants have on those bodies. Someone in VW's position could say, \"well our pollutants were one cause among many\" for any specific death. But they were part of the math. They contributed a share and lied about the size of it. They did indeed contribute to shortening the lifespan of millions of Europeans. reply alt227 1 hour agorootparentBefore the phrase was 'VW shortened the lifespan of millions'. Now after my posts you have changed that to 'They did indeed contribute to shortening the lifespan of millions' They are in no way the same sentences.

Take a piece of string and send it around a group of people. Tell each of them to cut a bit of the string off. Each person in the group has now participated in the shortening of the string. You can, completely accurately and honestly, say both of these sentences: \"Person 1 shortened the length of the string.\" \"Person 1 contributed to shortening the length of the string.\" These statements are not in any way in conflict.

Why do you insist on trying to reduce my opinion, which you do not understand, into metaphors which have no relevance? > \"Person 1 shortened the length of the string.\" This statement implies a direct influence, ie Person 1 cut or broke the string, therefore directly shortened it. > \"Person 1 contributed to shortening the length of the string.\" This statement is much more vague. What part did person 1 contribute? Did they make the scissors which cut the string? Did they mine the metal for thoise scissors? Did they hypnotise or manipulate the will of the person who did actually cut the string? There is nuance here, and you dont seem to be understanding it at all. reply Dylan16807 1 hour agorootparentWhich part are you saying wasn't direct?

I don't think there's a reasonable argument that the emissions didn't directly shorten lives, even if you think the precise number is impossible to calculate.

That sentence started with a \"then\", and apparently the premise of that sentence wasn't correct in the first place.

Neither phrasing specifies the exact amount of contribution the subject had on the target.

Disney's product (though not their core, I would argue) allegedly killed this poor woman - however it is the lawyers' behaviour, not the death itself, that is an additional PR liability for Disney; death from an allergy is tragic, but could have potentially happened at any restaurant in the country. Only Disney (and a select few other large corps) could pull this particular bad act in defence. As an aside, the entire line of argument from Disney is an absurd legal fiction. No reasonable person reads terms and conditions, and so they should not be bound by the terms. I hold a weak hope that this case is bad PR for the practice as a whole that raises the profile of this injustice. reply alt227 7 hours agorootparentDisneys product did not kill this woman.

It's making a sweeping generalization about millions of software engineers using 1 counterexample pertaining to one specific company, completely ignoring the impact the millions of other people have had through that practice. Extrapolating from a highly-non-random team of (say) ~100 engineers to a population of 4+ million is just a baseless thing to do. SCOTUS is the exact opposite of this. It has a whopping 9 members, all of whom directly influence every single decision -- which is published publicly. There is no other member of the population to extrapolate to (vs. the millions in the SWE case); you just have to extrapolate temporally... for which you have plenty of history to base things on. Making sweeping generalizations about how the majority of them operate is as close to the exact opposite of baseless as it could possibly be.

Judges shut down some loopholes or 'hacks', but then others are allowed as being perfectly acceptable. The rational that decides when one is allowed and one is not seems to be a second level to the hacking. You can't just exploit the law, but find a way to ensure the exploitation is ruled valid. Given judges are people, it does make it more 'squishy' than things on the tech side. Hacks have to appear clever but not insulting, and sometimes you have to fish for the right judge or court to support you, but that is all just the social engineering part of the hacking. reply devjab 13 hours agoparentprevJust wait till you learn that law isn’t really law. I once worked on an OSS project for 8 municipalities to handle employee work related driving. The Danish tax law on the area is short and the simplest law text I’ve ever read, and we implemented it as such. Only to find out that the 8 cities interpreted this short piece or law in more than 8 different ways. Yes, even within the same admin they didn’t agree on how it should be interpreted. Some of the lawyers even got in heated discussions because they felt the other were breaking the law. Anyway it wasn’t till later in the process where one of the lawyers who didn’t seem to have a whole lot of fucks to give explained it to me at the coffee machine. Basically our tax agency decides which interpretation is correct, but you don’t actually have to be correct until they directly tell you that you’re wrong. Which often won’t ever happen as virtually every organisation in the country handles employee driving and there are only five members of the tax agency doing check ups. reply ozim 6 hours agorootparentI think this is why lots of software projects fail - not because they are wrong - but it is just not what people want (and people might want things that are not according to the law ;) ). Then if it rubs the wrong way people who are in power then even if your project is technically right it gets canned and they blame developers on not delivering :( I can see it in business software I work on. Interesting part is \"required fields\", someone makes 10-20 fields required on a form to fill in - but then people start complaining it takes too much time and why they have to fill in those fields and managers of those people come over complaining that software sucks ... well, great but we did not make the requirements, that was company/customer that wanted that. reply devjab 29 minutes agorootparentWe incorporated all the different ways they wanted as feature flagged options. Then it was very easy to remove them when they asked us to do that. I get where you come from though. What we tend to do is to stage/gate things so that different teams have different required fields. Sometimes the same team depending on the process. Sometimes all the fields are optional until the “status” of a project needs to go forward, so that they can create a project with very little info but can’t actually pass it on to the next team until they have the required data.

They also claim that the ticket purchase terms of use explicitly say that they are in addition to the Disney+ account terms of use. I have no idea of this is true, but if it is, it might be more likely than it appears at first for this motion to succeed. At least there is some direct connection between the Disney+ account and the restaurant, it's not just that the husband happens to be Disney+ subscriber who wen to this restaurant.

It seems much more intuitive. reply tpmoney 3 hours agorootparentThey did. Their answer to the lawsuit advances that argument. This is a separate motion to stay the lawsuit proceedings and refer it to arbitration per the terms they claim were agreed to. Or put another way this motion isn’t claiming they aren’t liable because of the agreement to arbitration, they’re arguing that the venue is incorrect based on that agreement. The motion is for a stay of proceedings pending the arbitration. Edit: In fact the plaintiffs answer to this motion probably illustrates why this motion was filed in the first place. If you have and arbitration clause but you participate in a lawsuit voluntarily, the courts view this as waiving your right to arbitration. Presumably this is to protect against a case where a side engages in a lawsuit and seeing that it’s going badly for them, tries to have it switched to arbitration later. In order to have arbitration at all, they have to start by arguing for arbitration before committing too far into a court case reply nraynaud 11 hours agorootparentprevThey probably did, it’s just not newsworthy.

The terms do require Disney+ users to \"agree to resolve, by binding individual arbitration as provided below, all Disputes\" with some IP exceptions. But \"Disputes\" is a term of art that \"includes any claim, dispute, action, or other controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, whether based in contract, tort, statute, or common law, between you and Disney concerning the Disney Products or this Agreement\" (emphasis added).

I could understand signing an agreement to first attempt arbitration (with timeouts and bounds set), but it feels like you shouldn't be able to fundamentally sign this right away. They could literally enter into indefinite arbitration if they wanted to. I think this is a terrible use anyway: 1. The one month free trial contract was only valid during the one month, back in 2019. 2. The contract, even if it was still valid, was with the person who died, and not the family. 3. Due to Disney's claimed negligence, arbitration has become impossible, as they have now died. If this is allowed to stand, it means that when visiting a Disney park, an employee could gun down hundreds of people, and they would have zero recourse.

Ostensibly, the claimant wasn’t forced but contracted to do so. The problem, of course, is that an EULA for TV streaming shouldn’t extend to every interaction one has with one’s counterparty. And of course contracts should be negotiated between equals, not imposed unilaterally. The shrinkwrap agreement should IMHO be eliminated: one should either trade under standard society-wide terms, or negotiate terms on a case-by-case basis. > If this is allowed to stand, it means that when visiting a Disney park, an employee could gun down hundreds of people, and they would have zero recourse. They could poison thousands of guests, and they would be stuck to resolution by arbitration, which is a process they entirely control. Well, criminal charges would still be possible. Remember, the criminal and civil systems are different. And of course arbitration is not supposed to be completely controlled by one of the parties. It may be in fact, but it’s not supposed to be. When the arbitration is between equals, it’s probably pretty fair; when it’s unilateral, it may not be. reply dadver 7 hours agorootparentprevIf I'm understanding the article correctly, re: (2), the 'contract' was between Disney and the widower husband (Piccolo), not the deceased (Tangsuan).

Disney is the landlord. However the plaintiff is suing Disney on the grounds that the menu of the restaurant was published on Disney's website, and that within this menu was a claim that the restaurant is \"allergen-free\". But given that it does not seem like Disney produced this menu (only re-published it on behalf of the lessee), that seems like very tenuous grounds on which to sue Disney. By filing this motion to dismiss, Disney is saying \"if that connection is enough basis to sue us, then the pre-existing contract we have with the plaintiff should be enough to dismiss\". I agree with other commenters in this thread that we do not want to set the precedent that a dismissal on these grounds would create, but at the same time I think the plaintiff suing Disney in the first place is overly litigious. reply tsimionescu 13 hours agorootparentIt's also important to note that Disney is saying that the plaintiff bought the Disneyland tickets through this Disney+ account, and that the purchase agreement re-iterated the general Disney+ terms as well. So the connection isn't \"he happened to be a subscriber of Disney's streaming service\" as the original article makes it sound. It's \"he clicked agree on these terms when he bought access to Disneyland, where the restaurant was\". reply seba_dos1 12 hours agorootparentThe article states that tickets haven't been used. That's not where the restaurant was. reply tsimionescu 10 hours agorootparentYou're right, I only looked at Disney's filing and didn't understand that the tickets are just as unrelated as the streaming service... reply pishpash 13 hours agorootparentprevThat's disingenuous. Menu being on Disney's website makes Disney more than a landlord, more like a service provider. Is Disney responsible for what's on its site or not? What if the menu had some hate speech or terrorism? reply fastball 13 hours agorootparentDisney Springs is a mall. Most malls re-publish menus and other relevant materials on behalf of their lessees on their website for the benefit and convenience of the consumer. The idea that this act is somehow an endorsement of said materials is what is disingenuous. Nowhere does Disney claim that they have validated the menu as correct, and I personally don't think it is reasonable for someone to imply that they are doing so. If the restaurant is liable due to misrepresentations they made in their menu, they made those same misrepresentations to Disney as much as to the plaintiff. Even if you do think they are less landlord and more \"service provider\", that doesn't matter much either, given Section 230 of the CDA. Service providers are indeed not liable for hate speech and \"terrorism\" created by 3rd parties. On top of all that, finding Disney at fault on account of publishing a menu also requires that the restaurant is actually at fault in the first place, which has not been demonstrated. reply pishpash 12 hours agorootparentUsually sites redirect you to another site with a modal heavily disclaiming that they are in any way related or responsible for content. If Disney did not do that and it's on their site then sure they use the CDA backstop if they can demonstrate they are not the source of the menu. Why are you certain the menu isn't co-developed or branded in some way though? I'm not sure why to even bring up the Disney+ user agreement if it were so clearcut, especially as it engages at the level of presuming the service is indeed a Disney one. Isn't it curious? reply fastball 12 hours agorootparentThat's a fair point. I looked at the websites of some other malls and it does seem like Disney has gone \"above and beyond\" to re-publish the menu in its entirety on their website, where other malls would just link to the lessee's website for that purpose. However, I have now checked the Wayback Machine to see what the website looked like[1] in September 2023 (before the death in October 2023), and honestly even if Disney themselves produced this menu content (which does not seem to be what the plaintiff is claiming), then it still feels like the plaintiff has misrepresented what was on this website. Specifically the plaintiff says that the menu claimed items were \"allergen-free\", when in actuality the disclaimer specifically says the restaurant does not claim that. Copying the relevant section from the end of the menu: > About our allergy-friendly menu items: Guests may consult with a chef or special diets trained Cast Member before placing an order. We use reasonable efforts in our sourcing, preparation and handling procedures to avoid the introduction of the named allergens into allergy-friendly menu choices.

However, if you go to the restaurant in-person and you ask the server who asks the chef and they both say it can be done allergen-free on multiple requests I think it's safe to safe that the website's disclaimer is overriden. Which is what the lawsuit claims [1] (I wish I could get a courtlistener link but I had no success [2]). [1]: https://www.scribd.com/document/708687171/Raglan-Road-Lawsui... [2]: https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=Disney&type=o&order_by=scor... reply caddemon 6 hours agorootparentSure that overrides the disclaimer for the restaurant, and I'm inclined to agree with you there because every restaurant has some disclaimer like this that if enforced would make any \"allergen-free\" claims worthless everywhere. But that would still make Disney less liable, because the in person conversation with staff/chef has nothing to do with Disney here. Although it is interesting that the restaurants operated by others still use the \"cast member\" language. I do think Disney tries to have a bit of an illusion that everything on property including Disney springs is them. I still wouldn't consider it enough legally here but there is at least an argument about assumption of oversight. reply nadermx 13 hours agoparentprevThis was filed in may, was there a response already from the plaintiffs? reply fastball 13 hours agorootparentHere is the plaintiff response: https://assets.ctfassets.net/3kqcuzntcg31/44jbm0vnEx1KrdgIYO... reply simpaticoder 12 hours agoprevAnyone doing business with Disney should cancel their D+ subscription and pay an attorney to properly notify Disney Corp. that the terms of The Agreement no longer apply.

Their initial response to the lawsuit (included in the appendix of that plaintiff's response) is a pretty stock \"we don't think we have liability here, it's on the restaurant\" response. But the plaintiff response notes an aspect of law where a party willingly participating in a lawsuit without asserting their right to arbitration early is presumed to be waiving that right. So it sounds like Disney must produce some argument early in the proceedings that this should be removed to arbitration in order to preserve that possibility assuming that it is something that would be covered by the arbitration agreements. I'm not sure I buy how they connect their agreements specifically to transactions in this publicly accessible mall, but it seems like if they didn't make the attempt at all, they couldn't later make the attempt if later in the court process something came to light that indicated this should have been handled with arbitration. reply Log_out_ 13 hours agoparentprevThe point of arbitration is to errode the rule of law and attack the state. Surplanting it with \"company law\" which is not supervised/vetoed indirectly by democratic voting.

Surely there are some kind of criminal charges that can be brought against Disney? reply tpmoney 2 hours agoparentNot every death is the result of criminal action. At best, you might find some argument for criminally negligent behavior, but that's going to probably be a pretty big reach for the landlord of a 3rd party restaurant in a mall. Criminal negligence usually requires the accused to have engaged in conduct that they knew (or reasonably should have known) would put someone in danger. Even if you say that republishing the 3rd party's menu or even collaborating on that menu extends the civil liability to Disney, I'm having a hard time imagining any argument that those actions could be reasonably known to endanger someone without some evidence that the restaurant had no allergen policies or procedures and that Disney knew that and still placed wording to imply they did. reply moandcompany 12 hours agoprev(I am not a lawyer, not familiar with Florida state law, and this is not legal advice nor a legal opinion) It is possible that Disney's lawyers expect their motion to dismiss the wrongful death lawsuit from the Florida trial court and compel arbitration to fail, but are (1) attempting to take the shot and see if the judge agrees, which is a win for them, and (2) may be attempting to take advantage of the rules of procedure where even if their motion is denied, Disney can benefit. There is little for them to lose by trying. First, as others have commented, even if Disney's arguments fail, the only real consequences are born by the plaintiff in terms of time and other resources. Civil trials like this are wars of attrition between parties with vastly asymmetric resources. Second, under the rules of civil procedure in many states, which may be the case under Florida law, a denied motion to compel arbitration can be appealed and while that appeal is pending, the case would typically be \"stayed\" (i.e. paused). Resolution of the appeal can take several years, again applying consequences to the plaintiff in terms of time and other resources, even if the appeal fails. Because of the above, US corporate defendants have been observed to incorporate motions to compel arbitration into their strategies, even when no arbitration agreement, whatsoever, existed. Even in such a situation, when their motion to compel arbitration is denied, the trial court case is stayed (i.e. frozen) for several years while the denied motion to compel arbitration is pending appeal. In California, this became such a problem for both regular plaintiffs and the state's Attorney General, that the state legislature passed a law to change the rules of civil procedure, via SB365 (2023), which took effect this year on January 1, 2024. Under current California law, trial court cases are no longer automatically stayed while a denied motion to compel arbitration are pending appeal. https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtm... Meanwhile, under US Federal Law (from a Supreme Court ruling in Coinbase, Inc. v. Bielski - 2023), when a motion to compel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) is denied, the trial court case is automatically stayed. reply pokstad 13 hours agoprevSo if my child is run over to death by a Disney vehicle, I can’t sue them in court because I watch Bluey? reply fastball 14 hours agoprevIs it normal to go into anaphylaxis an appreciable time after eating the food that supposedly caused the allergic reaction?

Photograph: John Hanna/AP US policing Ex-Kansas police chief who raided local newspaper criminally charged Gideon Cody, former Marion police chief, is also accused of persuading a potential witness to withhold information Associated Press Tue 13 Aug 2024 15.49 EDT Share A former Kansas police chief who led a raid last year on a weekly newspaper has been charged with felony obstruction of justice and is accused of persuading a potential witness to withhold information from authorities when they later investigated his conduct. The single charge against Gideon Cody, the former Marion police chief, alleges that he knowingly or intentionally influenced the witness to withhold information on the day of the raid of the Marion County Record and the home of its publisher or sometime within the following six days. The charge was filed on Monday in state district court in Marion county and is not more specific about Cody’s alleged conduct. The raid sparked a national debate about press freedom focused on Marion, a town in Kansas of about 1,900 people set among rolling prairie hills. Also, newspaper publisher Eric Meyer’s mother, who co-owned the newspaper and lived with him, died the next day of a heart attack, and he blames the stress of the raid. View image in fullscreen Image from Marion police department body-camera video shows Gideon Cody during his department’s raid of the Marion County Record newspaper in August 2023. Photograph: AP Meyer said last week that authorities appear to be making Cody the “fall guy” for the raid when numerous officials were involved. He said on Tuesday that he suspects the criminal case ultimately will be resolved through a plea bargain so that Cody will not have a trial that would more fully disclose details about the raid. “We’re just being basic journalists here,” he said. “We want the whole story. We don’t want part of it.” A report from two special prosecutors last week referenced text messages between Cody and a local business owner after the raid. The business owner has said that Cody asked her to delete text messages between them, fearing people could get the wrong idea about their relationship, which she said was professional and platonic. The Associated Press left a message seeking comment at a possible cellphone number for Cody, and it was not immediately returned on Tuesday. Attorneys representing Cody in a federal lawsuit over the raid are not representing him in the criminal case and did not immediately know who was representing him. Cody justified the 11 August 2023 raid by saying he had evidence that Meyer, the newspaper and one of its reporters, Phyllis Zorn, had committed identity theft or other computer crimes in verifying the authenticity of a copy of the business owner’s state driving record provided to the newspaper by an acquaintance. The business owner was seeking Marion city council approval for a liquor license and the record showed that she potentially had driven without a valid license for years. However, she later had her license reinstated. The prosecutors’ report concluded that no crime was committed by Meyer, Zorn or the newspaper and that Cody reached an erroneous conclusion about their conduct because of a poor investigation. Zorn used the information she had to legally search an online state database using her own name.

At the scale these tech companies operate, their influence over our our political process and daily lives is far more dangerous. Freedom of speech and press are part of the first amendment in the US for a reason - a free society depends on that right and any violation of it is bad. In my view the end effect on suppressing journalism and speech is the same, whether it is a censorship friendly tech giant or a police officer breaking the law, and therefore the parallel makes sense. reply ffgjgf1 11 hours agorootparent> also have monopolies over a certain kind of power But they don’t.

You’re ignoring the “for a reason” part. Freedom of speech and press are principles that are in the first amendment but also exist independent of it, and are older than the US. We should strive to have those values enforced everywhere, not just in the government - but especially at large companies that are immune to competition in many ways. And especially in social media, which is basically a utility for the digital public square. > If taken to the extreme limiting the rights of a social network/other tech platform to spread missinformation or propaganda is a violation of their freedom of speech that’s not clearly compatible with the first amendment. It’s not a violation of their freedom of speech, just like regulating cellphone carriers is not. Social networks are just utilities or common carriers. Like your phone service, they should be obligated to provide service and not deny it, independent of content. Also, the label “misinformation” doesn’t mean anything much these days. It’s just an empty label used to attack opposition, and it is rarely used when the misinformation aligns with the platform owner. Propaganda thrives when different sides’ ideas aren’t given a fair chance, like on most social media platforms. Propaganda is literally a systematic attempt to manipulate public opinion, which is what social media companies are doing when they implement vast moderation/censorship programs that reflect their employees biases. reply lolinder 14 hours agorootparentprevI think it's perfectly reasonable to have a conversation about whether we need to treat the major platforms as public utilities and force them to provide equal access. There are good arguments to be made on both sides and it's worth airing them. What I object to is your framing in the initial comment that it's unprincipled to oppose police suppression of speech but not oppose platform refusal to project speech. That's just the popular but mindless internet attitude of \"anyone who disagrees with me is not just wrong but bad\", and that attitude is far worse for public discourse and freedom of expression than anything the platforms are doing. reply blackeyeblitzar 13 hours agorootparent> What I object to is your framing in the initial comment that it's unprincipled to oppose police suppression of speech but not oppose platform refusal to project speech.

I don’t understand the logic behind your statements here. You are calling my framing “mindless”, without any justification - other than trying to create some strange association with your quoted bit. As I explained in my prior comment, police censorship and tech censorship are problems with parallels, because they both result in the same negative thing - which is suppression of journalism and speech. It is unprincipled to support suppression of journalism and speech in one form but find it unacceptable in another form. This is all pretty clear logically. You’re refusing to recognize this by whitewashing what tech companies do, by using a dystopian euphemism for THEIR censorship and suppression (“platform refusal to project speech”). The second part of what you are saying here also doesn’t make sense to me. You are literally saying that calling out unprincipled views that excuse suppression of journalism in some cases is worse than the actual suppression of journalism and speech that we’re seeking to protect? That makes no sense and just seems like a disingenuous distraction from the problem, which is censorship. reply macintux 15 hours agorootparentprevLet me know when Twitter shows up on your doorstep with guns and takes away your computer. reply blackeyeblitzar 13 hours agorootparentThey don’t need to even show up - they can just block your journalism from ever being seen, all from the comfort of their plush offices, and so it doesn’t matter if you keep your computer.

Is it censorship if I don’t let you shout slogans in my living room at 2am, too? reply jmyeet 18 hours agoprevI'm honestly surprised this has led to charges. I eagerly await the qualified immunity argument against this. Before we get too excited, there's lots of ways this can go wrong. People don't understand just how rigged the justice system is not to prosecute authority figures including the police. For example: 1. Manu jurisdictions require felony charges to first be approved by a grand jury. This is meant to protect citizens from spurious felony charges. The grand jury proces empanels a group of people, just like a jury, but they'll only hear evidence that the prosecutor presents. There is no defense counsel. The defendant is not present. Anyone interesting in pursuing a prosecution is not present. So what can go wrong? A prosecutor can intentionally bring a weak case and then hang their hat on the grand jury denying to pursue charges. It happens all the time. Why would a prosecutor do this? Because they rely on the police for prosecutions. If a prosecutor gets a reputation for locking up the police then their police witnesses start getting sick and missing court dates. And that prosecutor's conviction rate goes down, which ultimately is the only thing they care about. 2. Judges often either have a prosecution bias or they outright work for the benefit of the prosecution. There can be multiple reasons for this. Many judges are former prosecutors. Depending on your state, judges may be politicians effectively as they have to campaign for their position or their name is on the ballot to extend their term so narratives like \"tough on crime\" start appearing. There are three big recent examples of this: 1. The YSL trial in Georgia. The judge had ex-parte meetings with witnesses and the prosecution with no defense cousel present during which a witness was coerced to testify for the prosecution by the judge. That judge was ultimately forced to recuse themselves because thsi was such an egregious breach of the rules; 2. The Karen Reed trial in Massachussetts. This wasn't on the news much but was covered heavily on social media, particularly Tiktok. The list of sins by the prosecutors and judges are really too great to enumerate. 3. Alec Baldwin's trial for the death of a crew member on the set of Rust. The prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense. They hid bullets in a file of another case so the defense would never see it. This led to the case being dismissed with prejudice, rightly so. This is what's called a Brady violation [1]. Now because that was a high-profile case that happened. But sometimes the Brady violation is ignored. In a famous Supreme Court case (Connick v. Thomson [2]), the Supreme Court ruled that if just one prosecutor in an office does a Brady violation then it's fine. It's not a systemic problem. Crazy. Now we have had high profile cases where the police have been successfuly prosecuted, most notably Derek Chauvin. But those really are the exception. We're a long way from a conviction. [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_disclosure [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connick_v._Thompson reply cvoss 14 hours agoparentThere's a lot of unfounded speculation here. But I'll just address the one set of claims that have cited documentation, which turn out to be unfounded upon examination of the citations. > In a famous Supreme Court case (Connick v. Thomson [sic]), the Supreme Court ruled that if just one prosecutor in an office does a Brady violation then it's fine. The first paragraph of that decision [0] contradicts the claim. Thompson had two convictions against him overturned because of a single Brady violation. The Brady violation was not fine, and the court system recognized that. After all, Brady itself is a SCOTUS decision that holds that the eponymous action by the prosecution is unconstitutional under Due Process. Thompson received his due process upon review. On a topic unrelated to the constitutional question of the Brady violation, Connick v. Thompson asked whether Thompson was due civil damages because of a systematic failure of the DA's office to train its prosecutors, which he failed to show.

    "title": "Examples of Great URL Design (2023)",
    "originLink": "https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/examples-of-great-urls/",
    "originBody": "Examples of Great URL Design 2023-11-28 Here’s Kyle Aster on why thoughtful URL design is important (in 2010): URLs are universal. They work in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, cURL, wget, your iPhone, Android and even written down on sticky notes. They are the one universal syntax of the web. Don’t take that for granted. I love this reminder of the ubiquity of URLs. They’re not just for typing into browser bars. They’re used in a plethora of ways: As targets for scripting and scraping and other programmatic data retrieval. As references, printed in the footnotes and appendixes of physical books. As actionable triggers accessible via physical mediums, e.g. scannable QR codes or IoT device buttons. And more! When I reflect on examples of great URL design[1] I’ve encountered through the years — URLs that, when I saw them, I paused and thought “Wow, that’s really neat!” — these are a few that come to mind. StackOverflow StackOverflow was the first place I remember encountering URLs that struck a nice balance between the needs of computers and humans. The URLs follow a pattern like this: /questions/:id/:slug :id is a unique identifier for the question that reveals nothing about the content. :slug, on the other hand, is a human-readable paraphrasing of the question that allows you to understand the question without ever actually going to the website. The beauty is :slug is an optional parameter in the URL. For example: stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767 Tells you nothing about the question being asked but it’s a valid URL that allows a server to easily find and serve that unique piece of content. But StackOverflow also supports the :slug part of the URL which allows humans to quickly understand the contents living at that URL. stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767/creating-a-blob-from-a-base64-string-in-javascript/ As noted, the :slug is optional. It is not required by the server to find and serve the contents in question. In fact, it can easily be changed over time without without breaking the URL (which I find quite elegant). Granted, it can also be used deceptively. For example, this is the same URL as above but it portends completely different contents (without breaking the link): stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767/how-to-bake-a-cake But hey, trade-offs in everything. Slack I remember when Slack launched a marketing campaign to educate people about the product. They used the language of the marketing campaign – “Slack is...” — in the page copy as well as in the URLs, e.g. slack.com/is slack.com/is/team-communication slack.com/is/everything-in-one-place slack.com/is/wherever-you-are I remember being so intrigued at this effort to bring the design of the story-telling campaign all the way up into the URLs themselves. Since then, I’ve always found delight in URLs that try to form natural languages sentences — slack.com/is/team-communication — rather than concatenate a series of hierarchical keywords — slack.com/product/team-communication. Speaking of doing fun things with sentence structure in your URLs... Jessica Hische Jessica Hische has her website under a .is domain (which is for Iceland, apparently). jessicahische.is She riffs on this fun third-person form of “I am” across her site. For example, click on “About” in the primary navigation and it takes you to: jessicahische.is/anoversharer That’s fun! mydomain.com/about is clear too, but I love the whimsy of describing the “about” and doing it in sentence structure. All of the nouns in her primary navigation follow this pattern, as well as her individual pieces of work. Like this writeup about one of her holiday culinary packaging gigs has the URL: jessicahische.is/sofulloffancypopcorn Fun! URLs as Product I’ve always loved services whose URLs map nicely to their domain semantics. For example, GitHub’s URLs map really well to git semantics like the three dot diff comparison in git: /:owner/:project/compare/ref1...ref2 e.g. github.com/django/django/compare/4.2.7...main For technical products, this ability to navigate a website without necessarily seeing the user interface is a cool superpower. NPM is somewhat similar. Want to see react-router on NPM? You don’t have to go to NPM’s home page and click around or use their search box. Once you become familiar with their site structure, you know you can lookup a package using: /package/:package-name e.g. npmjs.com/package/react-router Want to lookup a specific version of a package? /package/:package-name/v/:semver e.g. npmjs.com/package/react-router/v/5.3.4 These kinds of shortcuts are super useful when you’re using a particular product. In the case of NPM, you’re hunting through your package.json and need to lookup some details of a specific package pinned at a specific version, you can navigate to NPM’s details of that package by merely identifying the version you want and typing the details into a URL bar. NPM CDNs like unpkg do a good job at following these semantics as well. Want a file from a published package? The homepage of unpkg says: unpkg.com/:package@:version/:file In cases like this, the URL can be the product itself which makes its design all the more vital[2]. What’s Yours? These are a few examples of URLs I’ve enjoyed using or seeing over the years. I’m sure there are others, but I’d be curious to know what your favorites are? Blog ’em! FOOTNOTES I haven’t found a lot of great resources on “great URL design”. This article by Alex was pretty good. I almost wish there was a “Dribble” for URL design. Just people showing off great URLs. For anyone with the ambition, url-gallery.com is available… ⏎ Michael Jackson, creator of unpkg, pointed out: “It amazes me that unpkg has become as popular as it is considering that every URL anyone has ever used with it was crafted by hand. There is no search box.” That is amazing indeed! unpkg is very popular: 50 billion requests in a month in Sept-Oct of 2020. ⏎ REPLY Email Mastodon Twitter OTHER POSTS THAT LINK HERE (2024) Cool URIs Don’t Change — But Humans Do",

It's also useful so that URL's can be sorted by date. Also, \"you're not going to publish two essays with the same title\" feels false. If you write 1,000 pieces and use short titles and tend to write about the same subjects, it feels extremely likely that you'll wind up repeating titles. reply didntcheck 4 hours agorootparentAnd it's sad how often one needs to use the URL to find the date, since many authors just don't put it on the page (corporate sites are particularly scared of dating their stuff) Others seem to think just day and month is fine, as if the year isn't the most significant part. And if both numbers areeven if almost entirely rewritten, it still has the original date in the URL If we're talking about blogs/news, they don't ever get almost entirely rewritten. The original publication is the only date that matters, and it matters a lot. If we're talking about evergreen content like documentation, then of course you don't put dates in the URL. A small \"last updated\" on the page itself is appropriate there. reply freedomben 3 hours agorootparent> If we're talking about blogs/news, they don't ever get almost entirely rewritten. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. It should be the case IMHO, but it (currently) isn't. The SEO/marketing people nowadays (ab)use popular pages for the search rankings and update them regularly to keep the content fresh and highly ranked (since search engines give much preference to new content). Also, even for strict blogs/news, it's not unusual for a particular post to be a draft for many months before publishing. Most serious blog will fix the date to match publish date, but that isn't what happens by default especially in Wordpress (which is the most important platform for blogs). reply dhosek 4 hours agorootparentprevIn fact, on my own blog, I have some recurring posts, e.g., https://www.dahosek.com/the-big-countdown/ https://www.dahosek.com/the-big-countdown-2/ ⋮ https://www.dahosek.com/the-big-countdown-11/ Alas, the default URL scheme in Wordpress doesn’t include the date. reply simonw 3 hours agorootparentprevA useful midpoint is to use just the year.

The success of Wordpress was mostly due to other factors (free, php, great feeds, great markup in default templates, great support for plugins). reply imrehg 7 hours agoprevI found Notion's URL schema interesting as well. They have to contend with renames of pages, reorganisation of the hierarchy and all that. So they have something like: notion.so/:account/Current-Name-of-Page-:pageid where the name changes if the page is renamed, but the redirect works, as the page ID is unchanged. In fact, one can just use notion.so/:account/:pageid and gets redirected to the right page, or even notion.so/:account/Anything-else-:pageid works too... This is very handy in my use cases, when various Notion data is extracted into another tool, reassembled, and then needed to have a link to the original page. I don't need to worry about the page's name, or how that name gets converted into the URL, or any race conditions.... The page hierarchy is then just within the navigaton, not in the URL, so moved pages continue to work too (even if this looks like a flatter hierarchy than it really is). I'm sure there are plenty of drawbacks, but I've found it an interesting, pragmatic solution. reply didntcheck 4 hours agoparentI've noticed that Confluence, Reddit, and a good number of news sites do the same thing. Usually the title segment is entirely ignored, meaning you can prank someone by changing the title part to something shocking, and it just redirects to the usual page, because the server only cared about the ID bit The fact that so many sites do this (including \"normie\" news sites) shows that site designers clearly believe users want and expect \"informational\"/\"denormalized\" URLs, rather than /?id=123 reply simonw 3 hours agorootparentIt’s an SEO thing. The better way to implement this is to serve a 301 redirect if the words in the URL don't match the expected ones, that avoids trickery and also removes the risk of the same page being accidentally indexed as duplicate content. reply KMnO4 4 hours agoparentprevThere is (was?) also a terrible flaw with this, in that any site hosted on Notion (even using its own domain) would show you public pages with a valid page id.

Third-party component have to coexist with existing site navigation logic, so generally you can't safely add URL-based configuration to such a component.

Tip for implementing that: * have a separate table that maps slugs to IDs, allowing many-to-one relationship, because content's title will be updated, and you don't want to break old links. * long slugs will get truncated by users. A zero-cost way to recover from that is `select id where slug >= ? order by slug limit 1` * in either case don't forget to redirect to the canonical URL, so that people can't create duplicate or misleading URLs on your site. reply lifthrasiir 7 hours agoparentI don't like slug-only URLs because they are hard to make concise.

They make URLs unnecessarily long, often forcing people to use URL shorteners -- completely defeating the purpose. They get awkward when the author changes the title. Other commenters mentioned some tricks to get around this issue, but all involve redirects. Cools URLs shouldn't change in the first place. They don't copy cleanly if you use nonalphanumeric characters, as in nearly every language other than English. Virtually nobody just looks at a URL these days anyway, with all the search engines, cute thumbnails, and OpenGraph metadata that provide a glimpse of the actual content for you before you even click on it. This is doubly true in the non-English-speaking parts of the world where a slug in a shared URL is often just a jumble of %HEX. Hand-picked words in URLs are fine, e.g. /about/me.

    "originBody": "About this Book The Rust programming language is extremely well suited for concurrency, and its ecosystem has many libraries that include lots of concurrent data structures, locks, and more. But implementing those structures correctly can be difficult. Even in the most well-used libraries, memory ordering bugs are not uncommon. In this practical book, Mara Bos, team lead of the Rust library team, helps Rust programmers of all levels gain a clear understanding of low-level concurrency. You’ll learn everything about atomics and memory ordering and how they're combined with basic operating system APIs to build common primitives like mutexes and condition variables. Once you’re done, you’ll have a firm grasp of how Rust’s memory model, the processor, and the role of the operating system all fit together. With this guide, you’ll learn: How Rust's type system works exceptionally well for programming concurrency correctly All about mutexes, condition variables, atomics, and memory ordering What happens in practice with atomic operations on Intel and ARM processors How locks are implemented with support from the operating system How to write correct code that includes concurrency, atomics, and locks How to build your own locking and synchronization primitives correctly Start reading Code Examples The code examples from this book are available on GitHub: https://github.com/m-ou-se/rust-atomics-and-locks Table of Contents Foreword by Paul E.

    "commentBody": "Rust Atomics and Locks (2023) (marabos.nl)196 points by 0xedb 21 hours agohidepastfavorite49 comments tialaramex 18 hours agoBecause this book was written more than a year ago, it spends some time on Windows Slim Reader Writer Locks, SRWLocks which at that time of its writing were how Rust's Mutex and RwLock were implemented on Windows (by the author in fact IIRC). Since then, two important things happened. 1. On Windows 8 and beyond Rust moved to WaitOnAddress with an API similar to the futex on several other systems. 2. We found out SRWLocks have a significant (arguably fatal, but depending on your use case it may seem irrelevant) difference between how they actually work and what Microsoft's API said about them. This bug is fixed... in Microsoft's own version control, not in released Windows versions. Specifically SRWLocks may silently give you a Write Lock, even if you asked only for a Read Lock, in the case where the lock was just released at the moment you asked. If you were expecting other threads to also get a read lock, which would ordinarily be possible - too bad, you've secretly been given the exclusive write lock so read locks are unavailable until you release it. The actual reason seems to be this: SRWLocks are small (a single pointer, with some low bits stolen to hide metadata) and the authors forgot that they actually know (because it's a different function call) whether you asked for a read or a write lock. Since they didn't have anywhere to store this single bit (read or write) they just assumed they don't know in this edge case where the lock happens to be available immediately, and since they \"don't know\" they always give you a write lock anyway. Oops. [Edited to make minor clarifications] reply forrestthewoods 18 hours agoparent> Specifically SRWLocks may silently give you a Write Lock, even if you asked only for a Read Lock, in the case where the lock was just released at the moment you asked. Oh hey, I reported that bug and behavior! One of my proudest reports. Not too often you find a legit bug, or at least documentation oversight, in such a core API. reply saghm 14 hours agorootparentDefinitely sounds like a legit bug to me! I'd only call this a \"documentation oversight\" in the sense that they could have the docs-equivalent of the fast-talking disclaimers at the end of commercials saying something like \"notactuallyareadwritelockmayormaynotallowconcurrentreadsdonotusewhenpregnantorbreastfeeedinguseatyourownrisk\" reply tialaramex 17 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I've also only very rarely seen real bugs in core system features (deadlock inside glibc's allocator a decade or more ago in my case IIRC) and I must say you got a much healthier reaction. It's definitely an actual bug not a doc bug. I've explained this a few times to people and it does seem like the natural inclination is to assume SRWLock must be supposed to do that, but I was glad to see internally Microsoft did fix this, because it's clearly the Wrong Thing™. I see two common defences for this bug. One is \"Actually, it's supposed to be unfair, you don't understand why that's a good idea\". Which assumes I'm expecting a fair lock and I'm unhappy not to get it. Giving a reader the reader lock when there's a writer waiting would be unfair - and probably a bad idea but I'm open to it if somebody presents benchmarks - but giving them the writer lock is just a bug. Another is \"Actually, there is a writer waiting, and this way that writer gets the lock faster\". As you wrote the example code you know that's false, there is no writer waiting, there are only readers and (in the buggy scenario) they're blocked forever for no reason. reply forrestthewoods 16 hours agorootparent> I must say you got a much healthier reaction. I definitely spent a lot of time carefully crafting the message and iterating on a minimal repro. Writing on the internet requires a LOT of defensive effort. It’s very annoying but is what it is.

One of the smallest pieces of work I'm proud of is a tool that automates the labor of Raymond's \"The poor man's way of identifying memory leaks\". The part where you need to be familiar with how your data types look in memory isn't automated, that's on you, but my tool (leakdice because it replaces the hexadecimal dice I previously used for this in real life) picks a random page of heap in a chosen (Linux) process and shows you what's in it, the rest is up to you as Raymond explains. reply forrestthewoods 58 minutes agorootparent> Does Raymond comment on Reddit?

If you've done heavy atomics and or locks in C or C++ or with Fortran libraries, this will help show you how rust prevents so many footguns at compile time. reply ridiculous_fish 19 hours agoprevAny thoughts on the best way to express global locks in Rust? A classic example is a set of bank accounts, atomically transacting with each other. Fine-grained per-account locking is possible, but risks deadlock due to lock ordering inversion. A simple solution is to replace per-account locks with a singleton global lock, covering all accounts. Any transaction must first acquire this lock, and now deadlock is impossible. But this is an awkward fit for Rust, whose locks want to own the data they protect. What's the best way to express a global lock, enforcing that certain data may only be accessed while the global lock is held? reply tialaramex 18 hours agoparentI don't think this is an awkward fit. There's no reason it should be Mutex it can be Mutex or indeed Mutex if you're really sure you don't actually want to lock any data. One piece of advice I'd suggest is, write APIs which take that MyTransferToken to signify that you must take the lock before calling them, it can be a unit type (a Zero Size type, a struct with no members) at the start if you like, but I suspect you'll find that across several functions which take that MyTransferToken you realise actually the data I was going to put in a separate parameter is really always accompanying that token, and so it might as well go inside the the MyTransferToken and before you know it your unit type that was just to ensure correct locking is in fact an object with important data protected by the lock. reply duped 17 hours agoparentprevYou would write Mutex> Instead of HashMap> Using a singleton is kind of overkill. But in the real world you'd probably use a transactional database for this (there are a few in memory options) with retries. reply returningfory2 19 hours agoparentprevMaybe define a new type in a such way that only 1 value of that type can be instantiated, and then put that unique value in a mutex. Any function that needs to hold the global lock accepts a value of the new type. Calling the function involves providing the value, which is proof that you are holding the mutex. reply saghm 14 hours agoparentprevMy first instinct would be to use a static instance of `LazyLock`[1] wrapping the data (or `OnceLock`[2] if needed). `LazyLock` only just got stabilized, and `OnceLock` only a bit less recently, but both have equivalents available via the `once_cell`[3] package for a while.

Acquiring the cell owner grants the ability to access the data, but doesn't tie ownership. reply lucasyvas 19 hours agoparentprevIf I’m understanding correctly can’t you lock on some other account criteria, like IDs? A Mutex does have to own the data but you can still decide what it owns. When you lock, the returned MutexGuard is owned, so you can pass it around or return it and it’s only dropped when it ultimately goes out of scope. reply volonoctu 3 hours agoprevReally good book and fairly comprehensive like a course.

It’s a very good book for anyone writing low-level multi-threaded code in C or C++ as well as Rust, because they have basically the same primitives. The only places I know where it isn’t applicable are the Linux kernel and Java, because their memory models and concurrency primitives predate and significantly differ from the Rust/C++/C models.

I don't know of any specific books to recommend. For many languages there is nothing resembling this, they tend to not get into the details Mara covers, if you get a mutex and maybe atomic arithmetic then they're done. If you wondered about C or C++, this book is the same content as for those languages but with Rust's syntax. The discrepancy between Rust's memory model and the memory model adopted in C++ 11 and subsequently C is mostly about a feature that's not available in your C or C++ compiler and (which is why Rust doesn't have it) probably won't ever be. C++ x.store(r1, std::memory_order_relaxed); is literally the same thing as Rust x.store(r1, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::Relaxed); The biggest syntax difference is that C++ x.store(r1) compiles, and in Rust it doesn't. But, chances are after reading Mara's book you will think it's weird not to specify the Ordering needed and never use this uh, convenience. reply freddierest 19 hours agorootparentThe classic for Java is \"Java Concurrency in Practice\", a great book for more than just Java. Java's happens-before memory model is similar to C++'s. I'll prob get this book, if only for the memory model chapter. reply ibraheemdev 19 hours agorootparentJava atomics are actually sequentially consistent. C# relaxes this to acquire/release. Though the general concept of happens-before is still immensely useful for learning atomics as sequential consistency is a superset of acquire/release. reply freddierest 17 hours agorootparentThanks for correction/clarification. Much as C# has a weaker memory model than Java, my mental model for memory models is weaker than I thought. Where do Rust and C++ lie wrt C# and Java? reply jcranmer 15 hours agorootparentAll of the memory models in question are based on data-race-free, which says (in essence) that as long as all cross-thread interactions follow happens-before, then you can act as if everybody is sequentially-consistent. The original Java 5 memory model only offered sequentially-consistent atomics to establish cross-thread happens-before in a primitive way. The C++11 memory model added three more kinds of atomics: acquire/release, consume/release (which was essentially a mistake [1]), and relaxed atomics (which, to oversimplify, establish atomicity without happens-before). Pretty much every memory model since C++11--which includes the Rust memory model--has based its definition on that memory model, with most systems defaulting an otherwise unadorned atomic operation to sequentially-consistent. Even Java has retrofitted ways to get weaker atomic semantics [2]. As a practical matter, most atomics could probably safely default to acquire/release over fully sequentially-consistent. The main difference between the two is that sequentially-consistent is safer if you've got multiple atomic variables in play (e.g., you're going with some fancy lockless algorithm), whereas acquire/release tends to largely be safe if there's only one atomic variable of concern (e.g., you're implementing locks of some kind). [1] A consume operation is an acquire, but only for loads data-dependent on the load operation. This is supposed to represent a situation that requires no fences on any system not named Alpha, but it turns out for reasons™ that compilers cannot reliably preserve source-level data dependencies, so no compiler really implemented consume/release. [2] Even Java 5 may have had it in sun.misc.Unsafe; I was never familiar with that API, so I don't know for certain. reply gpderetta 2 hours agorootparent> as long as all cross-thread interactions follow happens-before, then you can act as if everybody is sequentially-consistent. I don't think that's the actual guarantee. You can enforce happens-before with just acquire/release, but AFIK that's not enough to recover SC in the general case[1]. As far as I understand, The Data Race Free - Sequentially Consistent memory model (DRF-SC) used by C++11 (and I think Java), says that as long as all operation on atomics are SC and the program is data-race-free, then the whole program can be proven to be sequentially consistent. [1] but it might in some special cases, for example when all operations are mutex lock and unlock. reply imron 19 hours agoparentprevThis book!

    "originBody": "We are excited to release an early preview of Grok-2, a significant step forward from our previous model Grok-1.5, featuring frontier capabilities in chat, coding, and reasoning. At the same time, we are introducing Grok-2 mini, a small but capable sibling of Grok-2. An early version of Grok-2 has been tested on the LMSYS leaderboard under the name \"sus-column-r.\" At the time of this blog post, it is outperforming both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4-Turbo. Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini are currently in beta on 𝕏, and we are also making both models available through our enterprise API later this month. Grok-2 language model and chat capabilities We introduced an early version of Grok-2 under the name \"sus-column-r\" into the LMSYS chatbot arena, a popular competitive language model benchmark. It outperforms both Claude and GPT-4 on the LMSYS leaderboard in terms of its overall Elo score. Internally, we employ a comparable process to evaluate our models. Our AI Tutors engage with our models across a variety of tasks that reflect real-world interactions with Grok. During each interaction, the AI Tutors are presented with two responses generated by Grok. They select the superior response based on specific criteria outlined in our guidelines. We focused on evaluating model capabilities in two key areas: following instructions and providing accurate, factual information. Grok-2 has shown significant improvements in reasoning with retrieved content and in its tool use capabilities, such as correctly identifying missing information, reasoning through sequences of events, and discarding irrelevant posts. Benchmarks We evaluated the Grok-2 models across a series of academic benchmarks that included reasoning, reading comprehension, math, science, and coding. Both Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini demonstrate significant improvements over our previous Grok-1.5 model. They achieve performance levels competitive to other frontier models in areas such as graduate-level science knowledge (GPQA), general knowledge (MMLU, MMLU-Pro), and math competition problems (MATH). Additionally, Grok-2 excels in vision-based tasks, delivering state-of-the-art performance in visual math reasoning (MathVista) and in document-based question answering (DocVQA).

Experience Grok with real-time information on 𝕏 Over the past few months, we've been continuously improving Grok on the 𝕏 platform. Today, we're introducing the next evolution of the Grok experience, featuring a redesigned interface and new features. 𝕏 Premium and Premium+ users will have access to two new models: Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini. Grok-2 is our state-of-the-art AI assistant with advanced capabilities in both text and vision understanding, integrating real-time information from the 𝕏 platform, accessible through the Grok tab in the 𝕏 app. Grok-2 mini is our small but capable model that offers a balance between speed and answer quality. Compared to its predecessor, Grok-2 is more intuitive, steerable, and versatile across a wide range of tasks, whether you're seeking answers, collaborating on writing, or solving coding tasks. In collaboration with Black Forest Labs, we are experimenting with their FLUX.1 model to expand Grok’s capabilities on 𝕏. If you are a Premium or Premium+ subscriber, make sure to update to the latest version of the 𝕏 app in order to beta test Grok-2. Build with Grok using the Enterprise API We are also releasing Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini to developers through our new enterprise API platform later this month. Our upcoming API is built on a new bespoke tech stack that allows multi-region inference deployments for low-latency access across the world. We offer enhanced security features such as mandatory multi-factor authentication (e.g. using a Yubikey, Apple TouchID, or TOTP), rich traffic statistics, and advanced billing analytics (incl. detailed data exports). We further offer a management API that allows you to integrate team, user, and billing management into your existing in-house tools and services. Join our newsletter to get notified when we launch later this month. What is next? Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini are being rolled out on 𝕏. We are very excited about their applications to a range of AI-driven features, such as enhanced search capabilities, gaining deeper insights on 𝕏 posts, and improved reply functions, all powered by Grok. Soon, we will release a preview of multimodal understanding as a core part of the Grok experience on 𝕏 and API. Since announcing Grok-1 in November 2023, xAI has been moving at an extraordinary pace, driven by a small team with the highest talent density. We have introduced Grok-2, positioning us at the forefront of AI development. Our focus is on advancing core reasoning capabilities with our new compute cluster. We will have many more developments to share in the coming months. We are looking for individuals to join our small, focused team dedicated to building the most impactful innovations for the future of humanity. Apply to our positions here.",

What is the company’s ethical position though? It officially stemmed from Mr Musk’s objection that OpenAI was not open-source, but it too is not open-source. It followed Mr Musk’s letter to stop all AI development on frontier models, but it is a frontier model. It followed complaints that OpenAI trained on tweets, but it also trained on tweets. Companies like Meta, Mistral, or DeepSeek, address those complaints better, and all now play in the big league. reply baq 10 hours agoparent“Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.” sounds like mr Musk is a conservative. reply clarionbell 5 hours agorootparentI would encourage everybody who thinks so to pursue basic political and philosophical education. Perhaps with a dash of history. This definition is plainly wrong on so many levels that it's practically impossible to engage with. But I'll make that mistake and engage on two points. First, it implies that conservative position has somehow consistent features across time and space. There is difference between conservative in Germany, USA and China. Not to mention conservative in early, mid and late 20th century. Second, ignoring legal norms is neither stated, nor implicated position of conservative political movements. At very worst, we can accuse them of maintaining laws with discriminatory intents. But not of flaunting those same laws. reply sangnoir 2 hours agorootparentIf you're in a charitable mood, the context on when, where and who originally made the statement will provide clues on which strain of conservatism the statement is referring to. reply falcor84 1 hour agorootparentI found this about the origin and am not sure what to take from it: https://slate.com/business/2022/06/wilhoits-law-conservative... reply sangnoir 15 minutes agorootparentSo, the original author is an American living in Ohio, and made the comment in the year AD 2018 while critiquing an essay about the New Deal.

I say this as someone living in Pennsylvania, drowning in the hypocrisy and escalating hate this group of people has been spewing for the last ~8 years. Therefore I can completely understand why someone might focus on that as the most relevant definition on 'conservatism' today in the USA. didgeoridoo 6 hours agorootparentprevAccording to the random Crooked Timber blog commenter who coined that viral aphorism in 2018, yes.

Cue No True Conservative, etc. reply didgeoridoo 5 hours agorootparentObserving the last 10 years, which political movement is most associated with the idea that inherent identity characteristics should dictate how you are treated under the law? reply thrance 3 hours agorootparentIn those last ten years, Republicans have been utterly obsessed with \"identity characteristics\". From pushing back against gay marriage, abortion, civil rights... It's basically all they talk about in political rallies today. Not the economy or anything else, just how it is important to never talk about trans people, and how they should not exist. reply archagon 43 minutes agorootparentprevIn my observation, every time a prominent conservative breaks the law, all I hear from the right is how “he’s a good man,” “he learned his lesson,” “he was acting in good faith,” and so on — even if the crime is as egregious as homicide or pedophilia. The same generosity is never granted to someone not in the in-group: just look how Crystal Mason was treated when compared to the scores of Republicans who were caught with their hands in the cookie jar. In other words, identity politics to a T. reply drxzcl 5 hours agorootparentprevThe guys closing polling places in black neighbourhoods? The guys denying women and trans people healthcare? Identity politics has always been a conservative project. reply joenot443 5 hours agorootparentMy understanding is the earliest application of identity politics comes from thinkers like Fanon and Wollstonecraft, would you categorize them as being conservatives? reply drxzcl 4 hours agorootparentAgain, you are ignoring the identity based systems they describe, that have been in place for centuries before either of them were born. You know which ones I mean. reply ithkuil 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's probably a bad idea and it will likely backfire but nevertheless motivation matters and a lot of people are willing to cut some slack to that political movement because they're honestly convinced it was done in good faith to restore a balance and give some power to disenfranchised groups. reply llamaimperative 4 hours agorootparentprev\"In-group\" doesn't necessarily mean identity characteristics. In today's (US) conservative party, it distinctly means \"pledges personal allegiance to party leader.\" As an example: The \"conservative\" judge who threw out 40 years of precedent on a technicality to prevent the American public from learning whether their former and potentially future president sold, gave away, or otherwise exposed national security secrets after he undoubtedly stole those documents. There's a fundamental asymmetry in \"the movement\" on the left - which essentially rounds out to whatever annoying undergrad student showed up in your Twitter feed today - and the actual elected, governing leaders of the right, doing things like throwing out very strong criminal cases on matters of deep public importance. reply dredmorbius 2 hours agorootparentprevSometimes a phenomenon exists for a long time before being encapsulated in a concise, thought-provoking, and often (though not always) amusing aphorism. An excellent example would be Murphy's Law, and by extension many of the similar, often eponymous, laws. See: - List of Eponymous Laws:- Murphy's Law and other reasons why things go wrong! by Arthur Bloch:- Compilation of Murphy's (and similar) laws:Some of those are humourous, some are in fact quite serious though have a comedic element particularly out of context. Most speak to at least a colloquial truth. What Whilhoit did was manage to buttonhole a hypocrisy of modern conservativism, perhaps over the past few decades, perhaps a century or so (Anatole France, \"The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread\", further evidentiarially supported by SCOTUS in Grants Pass), perhaps by millennia (see the opening paragraphs of A.H.M. Jones, Augustus, describing the political situation in the late Roman Republic, quoted here: , and at greater length: ). It's not so much a proved hypothesis as a phrasing which fits the understanding of many and expresses it concisely and memorably. reply tacitusarc 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is unconstructive flamebait. reply dredmorbius 2 hours agorootparentprevQuote's by Frank Wilhoit. reply kardianos 6 hours agorootparentprevThat's not any conservatism that I recognize. In fact, what is espoused there is exactly the progressive left (Herbert Harcuse's \"repressive tolerance\") mindset. And while I will grant you that liberalism (not to be confused with leftism), is different then conservatism, both (classical) liberalism and conservatism strongly require equal treatment (procedural symmetry). reply thrance 3 hours agorootparentDidn't Trump himself say he would pardon the rioters that stormed the Capitol, if ever he was reelected ? Didn't he say that he would \"lock up\" all the \"sick, evil\" democrats after he is reelected ? Modern american conservatism very well fits the quote from grandparent. Also, surely you would know what \"repressive tolerance\" is, since you're quoting it ? You would also know that the author you cite, whose name you misspelled, was critiquing the concept ? reply kardianos 1 hour agorootparentYes, I fat-fingered his name, didn't I. It should be: \"Herbert Marcuse\". And no, I have not seen a primary source where in context Trump said that he would \"\" \"lock up\" all the \"sick, evil\" democrats after he is reelected\"\". Do you have such a primary source? Years ago I was told that Trump said the white supremacists were \"very fine people\", so I looked at the transcript and he literally said the opposite. reply thrance 26 minutes agorootparentHe said those words in an interview with Glenn Beck. Here's a Guardian article reporting on it: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/30/trump-interv... I don't think he ever endorsed white supremacists, but I think I remember (wouldn't bet on it) an instance where a journalist asked him why some keep showing up at his rallies and why he does nothing about it. He then answered that he doesn't really know who they are, that he didn't know, etc. basically eluding the question. i.e. they're welcome but won't proclaim his support for them, one of the many dog whistles Republicans use nowadays. reply archagon 34 minutes agorootparentprevI don't know what you read, but Trump is (or was) buddies with Fuentes: https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/25/trump-white-nationa... reply ribelo 10 hours agorootparentprevnext [5 more] [flagged] HeatrayEnjoyer 9 hours agorootparentI'm not following. reply TaylorAlexander 8 hours agorootparentribelo is saying that \"modern liberalism\" can be characterized by a belief that \"There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.\" At least in leftist philosophical circles, which are what I am familiar with, this is a relatively common critique of liberalism. Another common rhetorical tactic in leftist critiques is to point out that the bad beliefs liberals often blame the conservatives for having are actually in practice tenants of modern liberalism too. For example both conservatives and liberals are in favor to some degree of using the military overseas to maintain global hegemony. I don't know if ribelo is leftist or not but in any case I can see what they are going for. reply Moto7451 8 hours agorootparenthttps://slate.com/business/2022/06/wilhoits-law-conservative...

The other kid says \"I know you are, but what am I?\" That's pretty much what's going on with the GP comment. It's a really low-effort and really transparent attempt to paint the other side with what your side has been accused of. Mind you, I don't think it's a fair criticism of conservativism, either... reply binary132 6 hours agorootparentprevwhat a nasty vicious outgroup reply bko 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is not what conservatism is reply katzinsky 6 hours agorootparentIt's not a complete definition but he is right that conservatism is completely incompatible with universalism. This is a little confusing in the US and other Anglo countries because traditionally we have been fairly liberal so sometimes people confuse liberalism and conservatism. reply didgeoridoo 6 hours agorootparentIn the Anglo countries, what is being “conserved” is the liberal universalist tradition of the Enlightenment, and what is being “progressed” is a power- and identity-centered postmodernism. Don’t get this confused with conservative and progressive politicians, though, who are generally ignorant of the actual traditions and philosophies behind their respective movements, and are essentially just cutouts for competing media and financial corporate interests. The few holdouts on both sides have been successfully sidelined (Bernie Sanders, Ron Paul), and it looks like the military-industrial complex will have their war with Iran no matter what the results of the next few elections are. (Sorry, I’ll go have my coffee now and see if I get a little less doomer.) reply katzinsky 5 hours agorootparentActually I think you're overly optimistic. reply wavemode 6 hours agorootparentprevYou're going to need to provide a source for the definitions you're using for \"conservatism\", \"liberalism\" and \"universalism\". Without those, your comment is difficult to make any sense of, since the way you're using those words seems to differ from any sort of standardized definition. reply katzinsky 5 hours agorootparentI think we can both agree that for example liberalism and Islam are incompatible. So if you want to conserve liberalism you'll have to exclude Muslims. That's not universalist -> liberalism and universalism are incompatible. reply machdiamonds 10 hours agoparentprevPretty simple explanations for all of those: - xAI opens sources models with a 6 month lag, look at Grok 1 - No one else stopped development, so why should he? - He owns Twitter, why wouldn't it be okay for him to train on Tweets? reply viraptor 9 hours agorootparent> xAI opens sources models with a 6 month lag, look at Grok 1 That's what happened once, rather than a policy that we can expect to be applied. (Unless I missed some announcement?) Based on \"we'll publish the algorithm\" which ended up being a one-off partial snapshot, never updated afterwards, I wouldn't hold my breath for the models. > He owns Twitter, why wouldn't it be okay for him to train on Tweets?

Twitter didn't comply here with their hidden opt-out strategy. reply handsclean 8 hours agorootparentprev> He owns Twitter, why wouldn't it be okay for him to train on Tweets?

Whether those rights include training AI on the data is legally and morally in dispute. X claims that right in its ToS, but a ToS isn’t law and may be legally invalid, and besides that the ToS system is famously broken in the US. Morally, I think it’s pretty clear that reasonable users did consent to their content being published as a tweet, and did not consent to X recreating the content as their own and taking credit for it. reply varjag 5 hours agorootparentprevWhen I signed up on Twitter in 2009 these ToS in no way implied using my tweets as training data. Nor they are worded explicitly that way now either. reply oezi 8 hours agorootparentprevClearly does not include a provision to utilize Content for purposes of training an AI model. In fact, they didn't include any purpose for their own use of the data and following GDPR thus cannot use the data at all. They did include purposes for other companies (syndication, broadcast, etc) which also doesn't include training of AI. reply olalonde 5 hours agorootparentGDPR only covers europeans. Also I doubt very much it applies to publicly accessible data. reply gizajob 7 hours agorootparentprevErr, yeah clearly does: “you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).“ Not sure how anyone could defend that an AI model is not covered by this idea - such a model is easily covered by “distribution methods”. reply oezi 7 hours agorootparentNope, the GDPR separates the action you perform on data from the purpose of such action. You need to collect consent for a purpose. X didn't state a purpose for why they would do any of these actions. Thus under EU laws their data collection is likely unlawful. Adding a new purpose requires additional consent at least in the EU. reply gizajob 7 hours agorootparentWell you might be right but their lawyers don’t seem to share your concerns. reply maeil 6 hours agorootparentTheir lawyers may well share their concerns, but in the case of X, those lawyers may simply be getting ignored.

I just want to paraphrase his reasoning: In a recent interview on Lex Fridman, he envisioned a future where humans augmented AI, through a brain to computer device like Neuralink would be able to keep up with pure AI. Now one can immediately notice a hole in this reasoning: namely what guarantees that the AI that is use to augment humans is going to be benevolent and won't go rogue? reply kardianos 6 hours agoparentprevMusk has publicly stated his goal for AI is alignment with Truth, where truth is defined as to what corresponds with reality, not necessarily with the current social consensus. Specifically in terms of reason, given a set of facts, being able to reason to a real place, not just to a socially given answer. reply GuB-42 1 hour agorootparentWhich means essentially nothing. Most questions where alignment matter do not have a \"true\" answer, just a social consensus. You don't need an \"aligned\" AI to tell you the distance between the Earth and the Moon. You need an \"aligned\" AI to tell you not to rape people even if you can get away with it, that's because the idea that rape is bad is not an objective truth based on the laws of nature, it is a \"social consensus\". reply plorg 5 hours agorootparentprevThen surely he wouldn't be training on tweets. reply worstspotgain 10 hours agoparentprevnext [22 more] [flagged] zamalek 9 hours agorootparenthttps://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html : > Please don't comment about the voting on comments.

In my experience, HN is generally anti-Musk, so it is odd for me to see someone asserting the opposite. reply worstspotgain 5 hours agorootparentI answered your question honestly. You don't have to agree with my assumption or opinion. What matters (for the argument at hand) is if the facts were minimally enough to justify my opinion. You hinted that I might be giving up without trying to post, which was not the case. > In my experience, HN is generally anti-Musk I agree with this. I found the early moderation on this comment section to be suspiciously pro-Musk on a site that usually isn't. reply jorvi 8 hours agorootparentprevYou won't ever convince the people here that having your comment sent into the gray is detrimental. Not to mention the 1-9-90 rule[0], meaning 90% of people don't even understand how annoying it is to have a good comment sent into the gray. According to to them, getting your comment grayed out means its still technically there, so you aren't getting censored by the bandwagon. They fail to understand that graying out your comment signals to the cursory viewer that it is a low quality comment. Whereas often it is not. You might comment something that is factually right, but goes against HN's vibe du jour, so you get one or two downvotes, and then the larger group starts mass-clicking ▼ without any critical thought. A much more healthy system would just be sorting comments by vote activity and percentage-positive. It would still make controversial comments slightly less visible, but because there is not explicit signal of quality, no bandwagon effects.

Is this what you consider \"disparagement\" or do you have more egregious examples? reply kergonath 3 hours agorootparentI did not particularly keep track, I do not dedicate my life to obsessively follow even massive dangerous idiots.

Of course, having an ethical behaviour sometimes means making hard choices. It is not about doing things that are understandable in context, it’s about doing the right thing, even if it is at a cost to you in the short term. He does not have any history of doing so. These people are dead. Spitting on their graves because he is annoyed by their family is absolutely unethical. Particularly since their main failure was to believe the smoke and mirrors about FSD, which is itself another ethical clusterfuck.

Having moral principles is completely orthogonal to being ethical. Ayn Rand had lots of moral principles and she was still a reckless sociopath. One of his moral principles is that greed is good, and his actions certainly are consistent with this one. He did lose a lot of money on Twitter, but you can hardly call that him following his moral principles, considering how things actually happened. > He doesn't care if his defense of free-speech causes him revenue losses on X.

But multiple times per week now for a long time you can see him sharing and commenting on things that are provably wrong and I don’t mean in some kind of “it’s just a different opinion” kind of way. There is never any kind of introspection, never any kind of “oh I was wrong” just proceeds to roll immediately into the next round of bullshit.

Since these \"safety\" features tend to also degrade the model, that's likely also helping them catch up in the benchmarks. reply 42lux 11 hours agoparentSadly it's at the level of Claude and way worse than grok-1 or Lama without safety.

This further feeds into my concern that the more advanced AI models we get, random enthusiasts at that site may no longer be able to rank them well, and tuning for Chatbot Arena might be a thing. One that is also exploited by GPT-4o. GPT-4o absolutely does not rank wildly ahead of Claude 3.5 Sonnet in a wide variety of benchmarks, yet it does in Chatbot Arena... People actually using Claude 3.5 Sonnet are also quite satisfied with its performance, often ranking it more helpful than GPT-4o when solving engineering problems, but at the expense of tighter usage limits. Chatbot Arena was great when they were still fairly stupid, but these days, remember that everyday people are put against the task of ranking premium LLM's even solving some logic puzzles, trick questions and with a deep general knowledge far beyond that of singular humans. They can strike against traditional weaknesses like math, but then all of them suffer. So it's not an easy task at all and I'm not sure the site is very reliable anymore other than for smaller models. reply lhl 9 hours agorootparentThere was a mini-uproar when GPT-4o-mini (an obviously \"dumber\" model) outscored claude-3.5-sonnet on Chatbot Arena, so much so that LMSYS released a subset of the battles: https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/gpt-4o-mini_battles You can review for yourself and decide if it was justified (you can compare based on W/L/T responses and matchups). Generally, Claude still has more refusals (easy wins for the model that actually answers the request), often has worse formatting (arguable if this is better, but people like it more), and is less verbose (personally, I'd prefer the right answer with less words, but ChatArena users generally disagree). If you look at the questions (and Chat Arena and Wildchat analyses), most people aren't using LLMs for math, reasoning, or even coding - if anything the arena usage is probably overly skewed to reasoning/trick questions due to the subset of people poking at the models. Of course, different people value different things. I've almost exclusively been using 3.5 Sonnet since it came out because it's been the best code assistant and Artifacts are great, only falling back to GPT-4o for occasional Code Interpreter work (for tricky problems, Mistral's Codestral actually seems to be a good fallback, often being able to debug issues that neither of those models can, despite being a tiny model in comparison). reply squigz 9 hours agorootparentprevIs there yet standardized ways of objectively testing LLMs? The Chatbot Arena thing has always felt weird to me; basically ranking them based on vibes. reply freediver 2 hours agorootparentShort answer is no, because there is no 'standardized' use case. One thing is sure - that current commonly used benchmarks are mostly polluted and worthless. So you have to go to niche ones. For example the one I check for coding is Aider LLM leaderboard [1]. We maintain Kagi LLM Benchmarking Project [2] optimized for the use case of using LLMs in search. [1] https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/ [2] https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/llm-benchmark.html reply maeil 6 hours agorootparentprevNot really. There's a hundred benchmarks, but all of them suffer from the same issues. They're rated by other LLMs, and the tasks are often too simple and similar to each other. The hope is that just gathering enough of these benchmarks means you get a representative test suite, but in my view we're still pretty far off. reply maeil 6 hours agorootparentprevYour concerns are valid. Two more things concerning Chatbot Arena: - The prompts people use on have an incredible sample bias towards certain tasks and styles, and as such are unrepresentative of \"overall performance\" which is what people expect from a leaderboard. - It is incredibly easy to game by a company, their employees or their fanboys if they would like to. No idea if anyone has done so, but it's trivial. Just to give one example of the bias; advances in non-English performance don't even register on the leaderboard because almost everyone rating completions there is doing so in English. You could have a model that's a 100 in English and a 0 on every other language, and it would do better on the leaderboard than a model that's a 98 in every human language in the world. reply lossolo 5 hours agorootparentprevUse this https://livebench.ai It's a better benchmark. reply pikseladam 12 hours agoprevIt uses FLUX.1 to generate images and it has been fun so far.

From a black box perspective, LLMs are pretty simple, you put text or images in, (possibly structured) text comes out, maybe with some tool invocations. If you use a good library for this, like Python's litellm for example, all it takes is changing one string in your code or config, as the library exposes most APIs of most providers under a simple, uniform interface. You might need to modify your prompt and run some evals on whatever task your app is solving, but even large companies regularly deprecate old models and introduce vastly better ones, so you should have a pipeline for that anyway. These models have very little \"stickiness\" or lock-in. If your app is a Twitter client and is built around the Twitter API, turning it into a Mastodon client built around the Mastodon API would take a lot of work. If your app uses Grok and is designed properly, switching over to a different model is so simple that it might be worth doing for half an hour during an outage. reply cosmosgenius 8 hours agorootparentPrompt to Output quality vary by a large amount between models IMO.

While you may need to redesign your prompt a bit, I bet for many use cases, LLMs are reasonably interchangeable, and the integration work required for an API change should be minimal. reply vincnetas 11 hours agorootparentOr like with ORM's you can start using intermediary library which unifies access to AI engines like Langchain4j (for java) and hides API details. reply perbu 11 hours agorootparentprevI assume it'll be a paid API so the \"contract\" is a lot more clear. Twitter never understood what to do with its API so pulling that particular rug makes sense. But I too wouldn't use this. X is playing fast and loose with ... everything, so having a business rely on their product seems risky. reply bitshiftfaced 7 hours agorootparentprevThose who would build on top of the API might be considering a couple of past changes that are significant, but not necessarily a reason to think they'll be further pain in the future: the company ownership changed, and those who train LLMs all of a sudden want all the human-created text on the internet. reply bboygravity 11 hours agorootparentprevIf they have the best model, everybody will use it. With LLMs (and AGI) it's really that simple: the company with the best model wins regardless of all else. reply threeseed 11 hours agorootparentIt isn't that simple at all. It's going to be a combination of price, performance, quality, reliability, availability etc. And since the prompts need to be optimised for each model there is a degree of vendor lock-in. reply autonomousErwin 11 hours agorootparentprevBest in what sense? Intelligence, speed, cost? Sometimes having a fast enough model at a low enough price makes you the obvious choice e.g. I know Claude is better than gpt-4o-mini but I use the latter for a lot more data processing because it's significantly cheaper and faster and the gains I'd get out of Claude seem somewhat marginal for my use case reply andsoitis 10 hours agorootparent> Best in what sense?

HOWEVER it's also baked into the model and can't be surgically removed after a complaint. That's the irreversibility part. You can't undo isolated training. You need to provide it a new data set and train it all over again. They won't do that because it's too costly. The problem with the above example is of course that it can also contain sensitive or private user details.

In particular, requesting an analysis of the problem first before jumping to conclusions can be more effective than just asking for the final answer directly. However, this analysis phase, or similar one, could just be done hidden in the background, but I don't think any are doing that yet. From the user point of view that would be just waiting, and from API point of view those tokens would also cost. Might just as well entertain the user with the text it processes in the meanwhile. reply seanhunter 8 hours agorootparentMy understanding is this used to be the case[1] but isn't really true any longer due to things like the \"star\" method for model training[2]. Empirically it absolutely (circa GPT3) used to be the case that if you prompted with \"Explain all your reasoning step by step and then give the answer at the end\" or similar it would give you a better answer for a complex question than if you said \"Just give me the answer and nothing else\" or similar, or asked for the answer first, and then circa gpt-4 answers started getting much longer even if you asked the model to be concise. That doesn't seem to be the case any more and there has been speculation this is down to the star method being used for training newer models. I say speculation because I don't believe people have come out and said they are using star for training. OpenAI referred to Q* somewhere but they wouldn't be drawn on whether that * is this \"star\" and although google were involved in publishing the star paper they haven't said gemini uses it (I don't think).

    "originBody": "HOME NOTES ABOUT WARES ART MUSIC Sort, sweep, and prune: Collision detection algorithms 5 Aug 2023 · 13 min read tags: algo games Sweep-and-prune is my go-to algorithm when I want to quickly implement collision detection for a game. I think it’s an awesome and elegant algorithm, so I wrote a post about it. This post is lengthy with many examples and explanations, thus split into two parts. You can jump to specific bits using this special springboard: Part 1: Simplified version 🔍 Visual comparison 📝 Code Part 2: Sophisticated versions 🔍 Visual comparison 📝 Final code As for the rest of the post, I try to paint a picture of what I think are first principles and show it with interactive demos! Let’s go! Collision detection As you may know, the problem of collision detection is pretty common in video game programming. It’s a prerequisite to the implementation of certain game mechanics or simulations. Goombas colliding Some of these mechanics include: preventing characters from passing through each other, goombas turning around when bumping into another, big cells eating smaller cells in agar.io, or just about any game physics. All of these need some kind of collision detection. Cells consuming smaller cells on contact Here I’ll cover several related approaches, starting with the simplest and building up to the sweep-and-prune algorithm. I won’t cover other approaches, such as space partitioning or spatial tree subdivision. Balls. I’ll use this rigid-body ball simulation as a recurring example to demonstrate the algorithms throughout the post: Alright, let’s dive in! How do we detect these collisions? Naive approach 🐥 The straightforward solution is to test every potential pair of objects for collision. That is, check every ball against every other ball. // for each ball for (let i = 0; iobject2.left && object1.topobject2.top; } In the above code, the intersects() function checks if two objects intersect by comparing their opposing bounds for each direction. (Refer to this MDN article for a better explanation.) We can break the test down to its constituent checks: object1.leftobject2.left object1.topobject2.top Each check is solely concerned with one particular axis in a specific direction. Here’s the key thing: Due to the && operator’s short-circuit evaluation, if any one of these checks turns out to be false, then the overall test will immediately evaluate to false. Our goal then is to generalise the case where at least one of these checks is false across many tests as possible. It’s the same idea as the separating axis theorem, which implies that two objects can’t be colliding if there’s at least one axis where their shadows don’t overlap. Let’s say we focus only on the second check - object1.right > object2.left. Don’t worry about the rest of the checks. As hinted above, optimising in just one axis can still make a big difference later, so we’ll focus on this single check for now. Let’s look at it in the context of multiple objects. Consider three objects - A, B, and C - in this horizontal configuration: There are three potential pairs to be checked here: A-B, B-C, and A-C. Remember, we’re trying to find redundant work. Pretend we’re running all the pairs through the check, like so: A.right > B.left // returns false B.right > C.left // returns false A.right > C.left // returns false See any redundant work? Maybe abstractify it a little… A > B // returns false B > C // returns false A > C // returns false Voilà. Due to the transitive property of inequality, realise that we don’t need to run the third test! If we know that A > B and B > C are both false, then we would know that A > C is false as well. “If a ≤ b and b ≤ c, then a ≤ c.” the transitive property of inequality So in this example, we don’t really need to run intersects(A, C). // 1. Test A-B intersects(A, B) // A.right > B.left evals to false. // 2. Test B-C intersects(B, C) // B.right > C.left evals to false. // 3. Infer that A.right > C.left is false. // ∴ Therefore I don’t need to call intersects(A, C) // to know that it will return false. We’ve skipped one intersects() call for free! ✨ I’m handwaving the fact that P.left ≤ P.right is implied for any object P. Nevertheless, working those details out would just mean more transitivity. You might be wondering how this contrived example could apply to general n-body collision detection. A smart reader such as you might also have realised that this skip only works if A, B, and C are in a particular order. What particular order? Try dragging the balls below to see when the optimisation applies and when it does not: // LIVE OUTPUT: intersects(A, B) // A.right > B.left evals to false intersects(B, C) // B.right > C.left evals to false // Deduce that intersects(A, C) will be false Tip: Drag the balls so that they’re horizontally spaced out in this order: A‑B‑C While it’s true that this skip only works when A, B, and C are ordered, remember that these labels are arbitrary! What if we simply decided to always call the leftmost ball A, the middle ball B, and the rightmost C? Then the optimisation would always be applicable! 🌌🧠 But wait… labeling objects according to some logical ordering is essentially ✨sorting✨! What if we sorted the list of objects every time? Would the number of skipped tests be worth the cost of sorting? Chapter 1. Sorting Sorting, inequalities, and optimisation go hand in hand in hand. A sorted list allows us to exploit the transitive property of inequality en masse. The inequality relationships of elements in a sorted list. Even if we had to sort the list of objects every frame, the quickest general sorting algorithm runs in O(n log n) time which is certainly lower than O(n2). As shown by the tri-object example above, to achieve the power to skip tests we need to sort the list of objects by x position. However, objects aren’t zero-width points. They’re widthy, by which I mean having a size thus occupying an interval in the x-axis, also known as “width”. How can one unambiguously sort by x position if objects span intervals in the x-axis? Sort by min x A solution to sorting widthy objects is to sort them by their minimum x (their left edge’s x-coordinate). This technique can be applied to improve the naive approach. It involves minimal modifications to the O(n2) solution. But it will result in a good chunk of tests skipped. I’ll explain later. First, the modified code: + // sort by min x + sortByLeft(balls); + // for each ball for (let i = 0; iball1.right) break; + // check for collision if (intersects(ball1, ball2)) { bounce(ball1, ball2); } } } It’s mostly the same as the naive solution, differing only in two extra lines of code. The first line sortByLeft(balls) simply sorts the list, with ranking based on the balls’ left edge x-coords. function sortByLeft(balls) { balls.sort((a,b) => a.left - b.left); } And in the inner loop, there is now this break: if (ball2.left > ball1.right) break; Let’s break that down. First, we know that the list is sorted, so the following statement holds true for any positive integer c: balls[j + c].left >= balls[j].left The break condition, which is derived from the first operand of the intersection test, if true indicates early that the current pair being tested for intersection would fail: balls2.left > ball1.right or balls[j].left > ball1.right But there are more implications. If it was true, then by combining the above two inequations… balls[j + c].left >= balls[j].left > ball1.right And by transitive property, the following statement would also be true! balls[j + c].left > ball1.right Which means the intersection tests of balls at balls[j + c] would also fail. We know this without needing to test those balls individually. A range of balls have been eliminated from testing! In conclusion, when the current ball2 balls[j] stops overlapping with the current ball1, then any further ball2s in the iteration balls[j + c] would be guaranteed to not overlap ball1 as well. In other words, we stop the inner loop when it gets too far away. Finally, here’s a demo: Pairs highlighted when tested by intersects(). Pretty cool, right! It’s much faster now. Some observations: Since the list is sorted, the tests are performed from left to right. More importantly, it visibly does fewer tests than the naive approach. 📉 This is due the above optimisation which effectively limits pairs to those that overlap in the x-axis! Let’s analyse the time complexity. 👓 The sort - if we take the \"fastest\" sorting algorithm, like mergesort or quicksort - would add an O(n log n) term. The two-level loop, now with an early break, would average out to O(n + m) where m is the total number of x-overlaps. This could degenerate into n2 but as mentioned above, it’s more useful to look at the average and best cases. At best, the loop would be O(n), wasting no excess processing when there are no overlaps. On average it’s O(n + m). The average case refers to a world where objects are mostly evenly distributed and only a couple intersections per object is happening. I think this is a reasonable assumption for a relatively simple video game like a platformer or side-scroller. Here’s the code with running time annotations: // O(n log n) sortByLeft(balls); // O(n + m) for (let i = 0; iball1.right) break; if (intersects(ball1, ball2)) { bounce(ball1, ball2); } } } Adding those together we get O(n log n + m). This is a super good improvement over the naive approach’s O(n2), because [1] n log n is much smaller than n2 and [2] it is partially output-based - depending on the number of overlaps, it does not process more than necessary. bigocheatsheet.com Furthermore, the choice of sorting algorithm could be improved. We’ll look into that in the next part (somehow better than n log n!). If you got this far trying to find a decent collision detection algorithm, then you can stop reading and take the above design! It’s the perfect balance between programming effort and running time performance. If you are curious how this develops or just want to see more interactive demos, read on to the next part. Visual comparison Here’s a side-by-side comparison of the strategies we’ve covered so far! Observe the amount of intersection tests required per frame. 🔍 n = 10 Global pairwise Sorted pairwise (Not shown: the cost of sorting. Let’s just say the intersection test is sufficiently expensive.) Aaand that concludes the first part. Those two lines of code definitely were the MVPs. How will it compare to the more advanced versions? Continued in part 2. Thanks for reading!

But in practice, you may get better performance from a \"worse\" sorting algorithm: insertion sort. The reason is that objects in collision detection systems tend to move relatively small steps between frames, meaning you can keep lists from the previous frame that are already mostly sorted. For sorting these mostly sorted lists, insertion sort tends towards O(n) while Quicksort tends towards O(n^2)! reply deathanatos 4 hours agoparentThe author covers this pretty much exactly as you describe it.

Most of these algorithms will also correctly shortcut trivial \"almost sorted\" cases like 123457689 (only longer, if you really only have nine elements you want a custom sort for that, there will be a correct algorithm and it's probably written down somewhere already) Rust's old sorts, both of them, get this right. There's a fair chance the current version of your C++ stdlib even gets this right in its unstable sort. In 1965 it's understandable that you reach for an insertion sort for this case, in 2024 it's embarrassing if your language doesn't provide a built-in sort where this just works. reply nextaccountic 1 hour agorootparent> Rust's old sorts, both of them, get this right.

For example that can be done by increasing the radius of the spheres by epsilon. As long as the spheres have not moved by epsilon, you don't need to recompute the index. To avoid latency peaks when you do need to recompute the index, you can start building a lagging index by sorting 10% each frame (aka amortizing the computation cost). After 10 frames you have an index that is valid as long as the position is within epsilon of the position 10 frames ago. reply RaftPeople 17 minutes agoprev> I won’t cover other approaches, such as space partitioning or spatial tree subdivision I'm curious about this comment, anyone know if the algorithm in the article is generally faster than space partitioning/spatial tree subdivision?

Is this true? The naive algorithm's outer loop (i) counts n - 1, while the inner loop (j) begins at i + 1 (so counts progressively less than n - 1). Not a CS major, is this roughly equivalent (for large values of n) to O(n2) or is it, as it appears, something less? reply qwery 5 hours agoparentThe \"optimisation\" of starting the inner loop at `j = i + 1` is done to avoid testing every pair of objects twice. [Ed: I should add that it also prevents testing an object against itself.] The algorithm is O(n^2) because every pair will be checked once. reply spacecadet_ 5 hours agoparentprevYou're right that it's not exactly n^2. For the i-th element we perform (n - i - 1) comparisons (indexing from 0). This adds up to a total of (n - 1) * n / 2 comparisons. (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number) In the end it doesn't make a difference for big-O analysis because it's used to describe the behavior when n approaches infinity, where the quadratic factor takes over. reply friendzis 6 hours agoparentprevBig O is just complexity classes, describing how number of abstract computations scale (that's the key word) with input size (input list length). Generally speaking, if you could analytically express number of computations as a function of input size, Big O takes the largest term and drops all factors. It does not necessarily describe performance of the algorithm. `20n2^+5n` and `2n^2 + 9001n` are both O(n^2) reply chipdart 2 hours agorootparent> It does not necessarily describe performance of the algorithm. Not necessarily true. It does indeed describe performance of the algorithm. It just compares scenarios with coarser granularity. You can tell from the very start that a O(1) algorithm is expected to outperform a O(N²) alternative. reply ohwellhere 2 hours agorootparentMy algorithms class taught to think of it not as \"describing performance\" in an absolute sense, but as \"describing how performance changes as the size of the input data increases\". It is not necessarily true that an O(1) algorithm will outperform an O(n^2) alternative on a particular set of data. But it is true that an O(1) algorithm will outperform an O(n^2) alternative as the size of the input data increases. reply chipdart 1 hour agorootparent> (...) but as \"describing how performance changes as the size of the input data increases\". Yes, that's the definition of asymptotic computational complexity. That's the whole point of these comparisons. It's pointless to compare algorithms when input size is in the single digit scale. reply Kubuxu 8 minutes agorootparentYou could have an O(N^2) algorithm outperform an O(N) on the scale of 10,000 (or whatever scale you want to imagine). The big-O notation compares only asymptotic behaviour, and sometimes the lower power factors are overwhelming. reply yeevs 6 hours agoparentprevit's the summation of numbers from 1 to n which is n(n+1)/2.

    "originBody": "Alternative implementation of the Bitwarden server API written in Rust and compatible with upstream Bitwarden clients*, perfect for self-hosted deployment where running the official resource-heavy service might not be ideal. 📢 Note: This project was known as Bitwarden_RS and has been renamed to separate itself from the official Bitwarden server in the hopes of avoiding confusion and trademark/branding issues. Please see #1642 for more explanation. Image is based on Rust implementation of Bitwarden API. This project is not associated with the Bitwarden project nor Bitwarden, Inc. ⚠IMPORTANT⚠: When using this server, please report any bugs or suggestions to us directly (look at the bottom of this page for ways to get in touch), regardless of whatever clients you are using (mobile, desktop, browser...). DO NOT use the official support channels. Features Basically full implementation of Bitwarden API is provided including: Organizations support Attachments and Send Vault API support Serving the static files for Vault interface Website icons API Authenticator and U2F support YubiKey and Duo support Emergency Access Installation Pull the docker image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage: docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest docker run -d --name vaultwarden -v /vw-data/:/data/ --restart unless-stopped -p 80:80 vaultwarden/server:latest This will preserve any persistent data under /vw-data/, you can adapt the path to whatever suits you. IMPORTANT: Most modern web browsers disallow the use of Web Crypto APIs in insecure contexts. In this case, you might get an error like Cannot read property 'importKey'. To solve this problem, you need to access the web vault via HTTPS or localhost. This can be configured in vaultwarden directly or using a third-party reverse proxy (some examples). If you have an available domain name, you can get HTTPS certificates with Let's Encrypt, or you can generate self-signed certificates with utilities like mkcert. Some proxies automatically do this step, like Caddy (see examples linked above). Usage See the vaultwarden wiki for more information on how to configure and run the vaultwarden server. Get in touch To ask a question, offer suggestions or new features or to get help configuring or installing the software, please use GitHub Discussions or the forum. If you spot any bugs or crashes with vaultwarden itself, please create an issue. Make sure you are on the latest version and there aren't any similar issues open, though! If you prefer to chat, we're usually hanging around at #vaultwarden:matrix.org room on Matrix. Feel free to join us! Sponsors Thanks for your contribution to the project!

I started using the project while it was still called bitwarden-rs. Apparently they were told to rename by Bitwarden (understandable). My setup was based on their Docker images, and thinking it was the safest option I had set up Watchtower to automatically update to the latest image nightly to get the latest security patches. But then I discovered that the bitwarden-rs image had not been updated for _months_ because of the rename. So basically I was hosting my whole password database in this, and I had suddenly lost security updates without realizing. Btw, I'm not blaming neither Vaultwarden or Bitwarden. But if you're going to self-host something this security critical, just be sure that you definitely monitor it _manually_ to make sure you're not on some unpatched vulnerable version some months down the line. reply OptionOfT 2 hours agorootparentPlease be careful with Watchtower. Its update functionally can not (by design) separate your ENV settings and the ones from the new container. E.g. you deploy with DATABASE_URL=x This becomes DATABASE_URL=x PYTHON=3.0.0 You did not set the Python one, the image did via ENV. Now a new version comes out with PYTHON=3.1.0. Watchtower doesn't know which ENVs you set and which ones came from the container as docker inspect exposes them in the same way. So now Watchtower deploys the new version (which only has Python 3.1.0) with DATABASE_URL=x PYTHON=3.0.0. And stuff stops working. I use an ansible playbook which maintains the only ENV vars that need to survive an update. reply MrOwen 3 hours agorootparentprevI've seen watchtower burn so many people... Better to put everything in git and run your own renovate bot which will create PRs for you to review and also pull in the changelogs to the PR itself so you can check for breaking changes. reply OptionOfT 2 hours agorootparentDo you have an example online?

With autocomplete it’s quick. There is a good mobile app for Pass though (I don’t use it). I try to separate the systems, and not to share as much as possible. Otherwise, Vaultwarden would quickly sync, and is reliable. Pass with Yubikey is more secure: You read the password for a site and other passwords are not exposed.

Setup was also effortless as I've got Caddy setup to reverse proxy containers in my network. I simply define what the subdomain should be for the container and where it can reach it and that's all there is to it. I've got Vaultwarden setup on one of my servers via Docker and I've got nightly backups of my vault to Dropbox via docker-volume-backup[0], which works wonderfully. I personally choose to self-host because I already have the infrastructure for it, so might as well put it to good use.

A form of disaster mitigation, if you want to think of it that way. reply Jnr 7 hours agoparentprevNot a business here, though using certain self hosted tools has paid off in work as well. So as a hobbyist, when you have a handful of services you are self hosting, adding another one makes more sense. And running 5+ different services is probably cheaper in the long term. If you have the skills, initial setup takes minutes. If you lack the skills, it is a good idea to invest your time into learning those skills, they are very handy if you work in the software development field. It certainly has become very useful at work for me. For me personally updates, backups, restores and deployments of containers are mostly automated and on average I don't spend more than an hour per month to maintain all of the already running services. Also I don't see the time as being wasted, since I enjoy doing it. Watching TV or playing video games is probably worse and I still do that as well, same as many other people. reply phoronixrly 4 hours agoparentprevI love open-source projects engineered in such a way as to deter exploitation for commercial use. reply ChocolateGod 7 hours agoparentprevThe container image is self-sufficient so you can deploy on a cloud container platform relatively easy. I did this with Scaleway, took 2-3 minutes to setup. reply jauntywundrkind 3 hours agoparentprevEvaluating these decisions one by one doesn't make sense. Yes, if you are looking at just the cost of setting up Vaultwarden, there's a significant amount of stuff to learn & practice to keep it up. But self-hosting scales horizontally. If you already run one service that uses postgres or MySQL, the next service often won't add much of a burden. For a lot of people, yeah, at present it makes no sense to get started. But the ability to get inertia, to carry the effort, can grow and grow into something really fierce. And even better, there are such good references & starting places out there today. Onedr0p's home-ops is a beautiful example (one among many) of investing hard on really good tools up front, so that the incrental cost of adding and managing new things is fantastically low. Years ago we would have to diy much of this, but today onedr0p can use well known community tools like Kubernetes, Flux ci/CD, gitops, and helm to get it done, to have other smart making the tools of self-hosting better for him. He's still the self hosting, but there's a sizable % of the engineering talent of the world helping to make his self hosting better & easier. That's pretty novel, and pretty excellent imo. https://github.com/onedr0p/home-ops reply tssge 7 hours agoparentprev>Genuine question, in what scenario is the self hosting setup and maintenance worth it? Maybe if you're a huge org with a dedicated security team and so on, which could easily handle managing such service. I guess at a certain point it would bring cost savings at a scale in comparison to using Bitwarden, where it costs per team member or seat. Inhouse team has fixed costs in comparison. Of course for smaller orgs or individuals there is little sense in hosting security software yourself. No way you're going to have enough time to manage the service and keep it secure, which is where almost all of such software's value is derived from. reply andix 7 hours agorootparentThe official Bitwarden server is also available for self hosting. For larger orgs this is probably the way to go instead of Vaultwarden.

Why would one choose to write something like this in Rust over easier-to-write languages like Go? reply super_flanker 2 hours agoparent> Is there a good argument for actually using Rust for such things? Can't speak for the author, but I'd choose Rust over Go/Java/Python for such projects for following reason: * Rust is a more pleasant language to work with, i.e. Sum type, pattern matching, and Drop trait closing resources/cancelling tasks. * Type system is much more robust than Go and Java, resulting in better quality code with less requirement of unit tests. * I don't care about performance much (for personal projects), but a free performance is always a win. reply zaggynl 5 hours agoprevHow does the Bitwarden client handle loss of connection to the Bitwarden or Vaultwarden server? Last I checked the local cache is gone after so many days, leaving you without your credentials. A combination of local password manager and a file sync service of your preference seems a good option as well. reply jerf 5 hours agoparentIf you care enough to run a personal Vaultwarden, you should care enough to back it up too. If you don't want to back it up, you probably shouldn't run it locally and just use the service. I'm somewhat less crazy-eyes about the importance of backing things up properly than some people on HN can get. A lot of personal content I can honestly just accept the risk of losing it. However, if there is an exception to that, your password vault is it. It is possible to get yourself into a situation where you are completely locked out of things and the more systems go to harder authentication that you can't even store in your head like TOTP and hardware tokens the easier it gets to be in a world where if you lose your vault you can't recover because you can't even log in to the email account you'd use to recover. reply alyandon 4 hours agorootparentIf you care enough to run a personal Vaultwarden, you should care enough to back it up too. If you don't want to back it up, you probably shouldn't run it locally and just use the service. Exactly right.

Could have something to do with the way I work (always several PC on/active and my own NextCloud install with issues from time to time...). Vaultwarden never had any sync issues. I guess because changing one login will give you 2 versions of the entire database when a conflict occurs, for Vaultwarden, it's just that one credential, which hardly ever happens. reply zikduruqe 6 hours agoparentprevPass, then syncing to a bare git repo inside your own network is the simplest way to go. reply cyrnel 6 hours agoprevWhen you all self-host this, you also do the following, right? - Create threat models that identify weaknesses in the design of your self-hosted setup. - Harden the OS with things like MAC, and harden the container with dropped privs, read-only root filesystem, and outbound network filtering. - Deploy an intrusion detection system to know if you've been compromised. - Perform all OS and app patching automatically, or regularly without fail. - Follow CVE feeds in case a zero day needs to be fixed before the next patch window. - Arrange for an expert to perform regular penetration tests. - Deploy a tool that detects and alerts on things like firewall misconfigurations. - Regularly test your backup and recovery methods, since if you also store 2FA codes and backup codes in there, you could be permanently locked out of your accounts. reply jerf 5 hours agoparentWell, what I have done is this analysis: 1. If for some reason a state-based actor takes interest in me, I'm boned no matter what I do. I wouldn't trust any hosted service in that circumstance and that includes the service I'm running Vaultwarden on. My vault isn't even what they'd necessarily attack; they'll go straight after my bank and straight after my other high-value accounts and there's nothing I can do about that either. 2. My self-hosted Vaultwarden setup will defeat any random scanner and the majority of random Joe Schmoe Hacker guys. In principle it even defeats a casual insider on my hosting service because just grabbing a disk image actually shouldn't help them much; they need to compromise Vaultwarden (not just the OS generally, Vaultwarden specifically) somehow, and probably actually my Vaultwarden client too. The rest of your concerns hypothesize a class of attacker I think borders on, but is perhaps not quite, nonexistent. I'm not really concerned about the super-skilled hacker, who is limited to only my vault as their attack vector, and apparently has very fresh if not zero-day vulns that they are willing to deploy against me and specifically me, only me, their payoff for their personalized and specialized hacking effort is just that they get specifically my (encrypted) vault and nobody else's. That is a very specific level[1] of interest in me this hacker, that is not defeated by my current setup, but is defeated by what you outline, has in me.

If the cost of your security policy is greater then the cost of a worst case compromise then you are probably over investing in security.

To me (and I'm pretty ignorant about this stuff), the biggest weakness of a password manager is that it's the one link in a chain that somebody needs to break to have all of my passwords. Hosting that at bitwarden.com or lastpass.com or whatever makes it an even sweeter target because those are known targets. At least self-hosting makes it more difficult for somebody else to find my password manager. Moving to Vaultwarden has its complications but it would also be fun, and maybe a cool project for the kids.

I also find Proton Pass to be a bit more helpful in associating urls with credentials, + I now use the 1 alias per login (each credential set has a unique email address) without any effort, Vaultwarden can't do that (yet?

I used it in conjunction with Vaultwarden for a year with the idea that I'd evaluate it as a family-wide replacement for 1P. In the end I went back to 1P. 1P does some things amazingly well. Here's the shortlist: - It loads quickly. This wasn't the reason I went back to 1P, but it loads an order of magnitude more quickly than any of Bitwarden's clients: Windows, Linux, iOS, Mac. Bitwarden is slow, slow, slow. I was willing to put up with it for freedom. I wanted Electron 1P to be awful. It's not. Electron Bitwarden kinda is... - The (I can't believe I'm saying this) killer feature: being able to sort passwords by date (or well - being able to sort at all). If you use a password manager long enough, you'll have a lot of passwords. Sometimes you need to find one manually. Bitwarden made this far more difficult than it needs to be. There's no way to sort the passwords. You have to use the (lackluster) search. - 1P can put your most recent passwords, secrets and make them easily accessible by default. Yep, more sorting issues. This is particularly helpful in my work related to software and infra development. There are often a lot of secrets, especially during spikes. It's nice to not have to hunt for them too much. - Shared vaults are better with 1P. Easy to move secrets, easy to de-dupe. Etc. etc. Everything about Bitwarden is fine for a single, technical user, but it's not for sharing secrets with non-technical family members at any scale. It's just too clumsy with too many sharp edges. I really, really wanted to leave 1P behind. But I came back to it.

Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images US military US air force avoids PFAS water cleanup, citing supreme court’s Chevron ruling EPA says Tucson’s drinking water is contaminated but air force claims agency lacks authority to order cleanup Tom Perkins Mon 12 Aug 2024 07.29 EDT Share The US air force is refusing to comply with an order to clean drinking water it polluted in Tucson, Arizona, claiming federal regulators lack authority after the conservative-dominated US supreme court overturned the “Chevron doctrine”. Air force bases contaminated the water with toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” and other dangerous compounds. Though former US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials and legal experts who reviewed the air force’s claim say the Chevron doctrine ruling probably would not apply to the order, the military’s claim that it would represents an early indication of how polluters will wield the controversial court decision to evade responsibility. It appears the air force is essentially attempting to expand the scope of the court’s ruling to thwart regulatory orders not covered by the decision, said Deborah Ann Sivas, director of the Stanford University Environmental Law Clinic. “It’s very odd,” she added. “It feels almost like an intimidation tactic, but it will be interesting to see if others take this approach and it bleeds over.” The supreme court in late June overturned the 40-year-old Chevron doctrine, one of its most important precedents. The decision sharply cut regulators’ power by giving judges the final say in interpreting ambiguous areas of the law during rule-making. Judges previously gave deference to regulatory agency experts on such questions. The ruling is expected to have a profound impact on the EPA’s ability to protect the public from pollution, and the Tucson dispute highlights the high stakes in such scenarios – clean drinking water and the health of hundreds of thousands of people hangs in the balance. Several air force bases are largely responsible for trichloroethylene (TCE) – volatile organic compounds – and PFAS contaminating drinking water sources in Tucson. A 10-sq-mile (26 sq km) area around the facilities and Tucson international airport were in the 1980s designated as a Superfund site, an action reserved for the nation’s most polluted areas. The EPA in late May issued an emergency order under the Safe Drinking Water Act requiring the air force to develop a plan within 60 days to address PFAS contamination in the drinking water. Filtration systems put in place in 2014 for TCE and other chemicals are currently removing PFAS, but the systems were not designed to remove PFAS, and the added burden is straining the system. Officials previously shut down a well in 2021 when contaminated water nearly broke through the system, the EPA wrote. Such a breach could leave the Arizona city without safe water. The EPA order requires the development of a system specifically designed for PFAS. A similar system is estimated to cost about $25m to develop, or about 0.1% of the air force’s annual budget. In a formal response sent to the EPA in the weeks after the supreme court reversed Chevron, the air force claimed the EPA lacked the authority to make the order, citing the case as evidence and stating “the EPA’s order can not withstand review”. But legal experts noted that Chevron does not affect EPA enforcement actions like the Tucson order – it only affects the rule-making process. Moreover, one arm of the administration cannot sue another, so the military cannot sue the EPA, and the case would never end up in court where the Chevron decision would come into play, said Walter Mugdan, a former EPA Superfund director. Instead, it would be resolved internally by a presidential administration instead of the judiciary. However, a business that finds itself in a similar position may try to sue the EPA, Sivas said. The air force did not respond to specific questions about its Chevron claim, but said it “will continue to meet our obligations under the federal [Superfund] law”. The crux of the rest of the air force’s refusal to comply with the order hangs on whether there is “imminent and substantial danger” to Tucson residents. The air force noted Tucson’s drinking water was currently below the federal limit for PFAS. But the EPA noted the filtration system was straining because it was not designed for PFAS, and the plume was especially dangerous because there are limited alternative drinking water sources in the desert. The real possibility that the system breaks and leaves people exposed or without clean water constitutes “imminent and substantial” danger, the EPA wrote in its response. “The law does not require or expect EPA to wait until people are actively being harmed,” the EPA added. “In fact, Congress expects EPA to utilize its authority to prevent the harm from materializing.” The air force also claimed it should not be forced to address the problem because the city of Tucson and state of Arizona are funding a different system to address PFAS. In response, the EPA said the new system would not be ready for years, and the air force is financially responsible for the pollution. “The Air Force bears responsibility for the PFAS contamination and needs to step forward to protect the Tucson community,” the EPA wrote.

The local civilians living in the area sued the local government operated water treatment plant. The local government in turned blamed the military, and the military refused to take responsibility. The court decided that regardless of what the military decide, local government are responsible to their citizen in terms of providing pollution free water. Local government can try to sue the military, but it does not change the ultimate responsibility they got to their citizens. The government has a responsibility to protect the public from pollution. If the cost come from the military budget, national government budget or local government budget is something the different departments can fight over, but the outcome is still the same. reply avalys 19 hours agoprevThe Supreme Court made the right decision. Unlike the hyperbolic coverage in the press - the decision did not say that judges are now responsible for making regulation, rather than experts in regulatory agencies. What they said is that now, if a statute is ambiguous, a regulatory agency makes a regulation that falls within that ambiguity, and someone files a lawsuit, the courts can play their standard, established role in resolving the ambiguity and figuring out the intent of Congress and determining whether the regulation is authorized by statute. Previously, Chevron deference required the courts to defer to the agency's interpretation of the statute, regardless of how unreasonable that interpretation was. This was abused by people who used it as a loophole to push through regulation which they knew would not be politically viable in Congress. Chevon deference allowed an end-run around democracy. And also led to uncertainty - because these regulations were politically controversial and not supported by law, just by executive branch fiat, they are prone to being revoked whenever the party holding the presidency changes. If a topic is important enough, Congress can always resolve any of these issues by amending the relevant statute. All of these controversies over Supreme Court decisions really come down to people who are advocating for positions and regulations which are unachievable through the normal political, legislative process in the US getting upset that the Supreme Court is not allowing them to enact these policies through backdoors and loopholes rather than the democratic process. reply SomaticPirate 19 hours agoparentIn terms of realpolitik though, Congress is so deadlocked that new proposed legislation is unlikely to ever come and if it does, lobbyists and special interests will have plenty of time to render it toothless. The coverage is not hyperbolic, it hits on real concerns that the courts will now be involved in every controversial decision. Previously, if your company was involved in something that would fall under the governance of a governmental agency, like dumping some new chemical into a body of water, the EPA could be brought in to make a ruling on the matter. Now, that ruling might not be in the best interest of that company depending on the level of regulatory capture. In our current world, that organization will now file a lawsuit to block the ruling of the govt organization and cite the removal of Chevron deference. Then a long, tedious process of court rulings might follow. With the ultimate ruling mentioning \"the Clean Water Act does not mentioned chemical XYZ specifically by name\". Resulting in the company continuing to release said chemical. When a new toxic chemical enters the water supply near your home, I hope that your congressman responds promptly. In my experience, they have been quite slow moving on most of my concerns... reply _heimdall 16 hours agorootparentThe US political system was setup from the very beginning to be intentionally slow moving. The Chevron deference, and all of the executive regulations that followed, were a workaround to functionally make legislation at a faster pace than the system was designed for. I.e. the deadlock is a feature not a bug. One huge problem though, and one that you allude to, is that we've created a web of legal protections allowing corporations to get away with all kinds of stuff in tandem with the regulatory framework propped up by Chevron. The problem as I see it isn't that companies will get away with dumping toxic chemicals until Congress holds them responsible. The problem is that companies are allowed to grow so large and powerful that only an act of Congress can stop them. reply fny 16 hours agorootparentIn this case we’re talking about the Air Force, so yes congress would need to intervene.

Even little old me! reply _heimdall 16 hours agorootparentThe comment I was replying to was talking about companies rather than the Air Force as mentioned in the OP. That said, company size and influence has plenty to do with dumping chemicals. Most importantly, they are able to buy regulatory cover for said dumping of chemicals. Dupont pulled this off extremely well, lying about what they knew to be damaging impact on ground water while buying off regulators who effectively looked the other way. It doesn't matter if dumping PFAS, in this case, is legal for me to do just like it is for a company or the Air Force. I am not engaging in activities that lead to a large amount of PFAS that I need to deal with. reply AnthonyMouse 14 hours agorootparentprev> In this case we’re talking about the Air Force, so yes congress would need to intervene. Well obviously not, the Air Force is under the command of the elected head of the executive branch. All you would need is for the President to tell them to do otherwise.

Otherwise why is the Air Force challenging the interpretation of their own administration's EPA? reply ensignavenger 9 hours agorootparentExactly this.

There is a lot of good theory - and practice - that the executive branch should be limited by consensus. The overall results are much better for everyone. > In terms of realpolitik though, Congress is so deadlocked that new proposed legislation is unlikely to ever come Happy to report that is just pessimism - I'd expect a democracy to very quickly enact laws that everyone agrees with and then sit deadlocked forever on everything else.

We must also live up to our commitments to our allies around the globe and quickly get more aid to innocent civilians caught in conflict, including in Gaza, where the humanitarian crisis is especially dire. I never believed we should link policy demands to emergency aid for our allies, but Republicans insisted—so Democrats negotiated in good faith over many weeks and now there is a bipartisan deal on border policy legislation. Ukraine’s fate and so much more hangs in the balance—it’s time for Congress to act.\" I don't trust that this can be represented as a border bill. The person introducing the bill seems to think it is a Ukraine (and Gaza) bill with compromises included. 80% of the money mentioned in the dot point list is going to non-border things. This tells us more about the Republican stance on foreign interventions than their feelings on borders. Also, the effort being put into calling this a \"bipartisan\" bill (in everything I'm reading, it seems) is highly suspect. They can't call a bill bipartisan if one side is voting against it - it clearly isn't bipartisan. reply BadHumans 17 hours agorootparentThe bill was co-sponsored and put together by Republican and Democrat senators which is why they call it bipartisan. I agree that I would prefer the bill didn't have any riders and was just a border bill but none of the Republican complaints have to do with the aid to Ukraine so I don't think it is relevant here. reply roenxi 16 hours agorootparent> ... but none of the Republican complaints have to do with the aid to Ukraine ... I'm repeating myself here I suppose, but do you have any references for what the Republicans are saying in their own words? Because the links were doing line-out-of-context quotes and I don't have confidence those are representative. I don't think there is strong evidence here that the Republicans were shooting things down border legislation to avoid giving Biden brownie points. The situation appears to be the the Democrats were trying to send ~$80 billion split among Ukraine/Israel/Taiwan and their negotiations to get that through Congress failed. In that process it doesn't look like the Dems were even trying to deal with the border except as a compromise. Occam's razor suggests that the bill wasn't going to get the outcome on the ground that the Republicans wanted.

This seems more like the Motte and Bailey disease in an election cycle. Both parties pass a bill that they both like 75% of, but then they need something to campaign on. So one party says \"we're going to repeal the dastardly bill\" and cites the parts of it they don't like. The other party says \"they say they're going to repeal the vital bill, we have to stop them\" and cites the parts of it that everybody likes. Then if the complaining party gets in they keep the parts everybody likes and maybe change some of the other parts.

Come on, that's obviously false. Even in an alternative world where agency rule-making was totally abolished, and everything has to be enacted directly through legislation, Congress could still defer to experts to draft that legislation. Also the courts themselves are supposed to be the experts at interpreting legislation. In our system of government, it's their job to have the final say about that. Let me put it another way: do you think it would be a good idea for judges to be required to defer to prosecutors (also in the executive branch) on the interpretation of criminal law? (e.g. \"Prosecutor: Your honor, the defendant is guilty because I say the law says he is. Judge: OK, your call.

How many laws will now need to be written to match the average number rules developed by all agencies per year over the past 40 years since Chevron? In practice, this will result in gigantic acts that members of congress can't read before voting, amd increase the likelihood of loopholes. Which is intentional, IMO. Frankly, when the judges and politicians who believe there are too many rules/too much government and decry government dysfunction suggest the answer is more rules or better laws (completely disregarding self-professed dysfunction), I won't take their words at face value, the sudden confidence in government competence and efficiency is likely tactical in pursuit of \"dismantling the administrative state\" (an actual stated goal). reply themaninthedark 17 hours agorootparentprevAnd by confusing, you mean they used the term nitrous oxide instead of nitrogen oxide.

I mostly don't agree with the individual points and sentiment though, so for now I'll touch on a few of those. 1. Individuals don't revive the regular process. OP offered their opinions and took the time to write them well enough for us to form some of our own. Democracy, in its ideal form, measures a society of perfectly informed minds, each drawing on their own experience. Ours might not live up to that ideal, but calmly describing pros/cons in current policy doesn't seem like a bad move. It's also not mutually exclusive with voting the \"right\" people in. 2. Appointed judges deciding policy can absolutely be democratic. If we're allowed to be one step removed with a representative democracy, why not 2? It's a nuanced problem, not an ALL-CAPS emergency. 2a. Particular judges seem to currently be behaving badly with little recourse. Maybe we should fix that. Maybe Chevron is a smokescreen enabling that problem. If that's what's happening, we should call a spade a spade. Maybe in that case it's worth fighting the new Chevron decision as a stop-gap measure, but that's very different from arguing that it's a bad decision a priori. 3. We'll see what abuse happens (abuse always happens; most major laws are worth a retrospective to see what the 2nd order effects actually were), but the decision was, at face value, absolutely not about judges deciding policy. It was saying that when ambiguity requiring judging exists, a judge should resolve that ambiguity. That's not a God-given nugget of ethics, but it is stronger than you seem to be giving it credit for. 4. Somewhat unrelated, suppose an ideal world exists where this particular decision is revoked (posit the existence; I'm not currently arguing for the decision one way or the other). If the policy makes our country better in the next 1, 5, or 10 years, is it worth being held back just because we can imagine a hypothetical world with a better congress? reply fdschoeneman 17 hours agorootparentprevSo use the existing democratic process.

The question you really have to ask is why would judges be less deferential to businesses and large entities than congress? Aside from lacking the skill they have no power to investigate the issue, which congress does, and can only operate on the arguments put forth in front of them. This is _explicitly_ a game which is won by money or size, and we seem to know this in any other sphere, but suddenly it's acceptable because occasionally the government _is_ the 800lb gorilla, and occasionally it _is_ incidentally doing what the people would want, when the entity it's challenging is significantly smaller than it.

I would consider officials appointed by the regularly elected position of President as more democratically controlled than federal judges.

If SCOTUS rules in a way I strongly disagree with, I'm SOL. And, because of of stare decisis, that ruling is likely to stand for a long time. >And also led to uncertainty - because these regulations were politically controversial and not supported by law, just by executive branch fiat, they are prone to being revoked whenever the party holding the presidency changes. Firstly, Chevron Deference required rules to be reasonable interpretations of the law. So it wasn't total fiat. Also, there are other laws that prevent capricious changes. The new rule must be proposed, published, and allowed time for public comment. Also, Chevron allowed courts to rule on ambiguous matters of law (e.g., how two laws interacted). Because judges are experts in federal laws. But for other questions, such as the dissent's citation of a case over whether a Pacific Northwest colony of squirrels qualified as a separate population from other parts of the country, there's no way I'd trust a judge to understand a crash course on biology, genetics, and ecology delivered by opposing sides in the span of a court case.

If I am satisfied with how my employees are behaving, I don't chastise them or correct them over minor ambiguities - I leave them alone to continue behaving in a manner I approve of.

But now you have a problem. What happens if the law that actually passed is ambiguous? Who resolves the ambiguity? The courts get the first pass. Then if there is consensus they got it wrong, Congress can change the law.

Congress and the Executive are supposed to hash out policy, seeing as they're the only branches controlled by elections. The Judiciary shouldn't have a say.

That's a terrible way to guide a country. reply cyberax 19 hours agoparentprev> Unlike the hyperbolic coverage in the press - the decision did not say that judges are now responsible for making regulation, rather than experts in regulatory agencies. They said EXACTLY that. There is absolutely NOTHING redeeming in the SCOTUS decision. Prior to that, courts were required to defer to the agencies for the matter of facts. E.g. if PFAS is a pollutant. Now everyone can just say: \"I don't belive PFAS is a pollutant, so there's no need to clean it up\". And this will have to be argued all the way up to the SCOTUS. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentYou can't just say \"I don't believe PFAS is a pollutant\", you have to convince a judge of that, and the EPA gets to make the opposite case.

The next issue is that you'll be pitting boring government bureaucrats against highly paid legal teams that can outdazzle pretty much anyone. But even putting all of this aside, the rulemaking process itself is not fast by design because it gives all the interested parties plenty of time to interact with the agencies. A typical rule takes about 3 years to finalize. Then you can delay it for 4-5 years by simply going through the court process as slowly as you can. And if you get a split judgement by going into the la-la land of East Texas judges and in parallel by suing in another location, you can drag it out even more by waiting on the SCOTUS! So you're looking at a _decade_ between a rule and its implementation. But wait, there's even more! You can then question the enforcement actions in a separate lawsuit! You won't be able to drag it out as much, but another 2-3 years is a possibility. Some libertardians suggested: \"Hey!

The judiciary would come in if Congress thought the executive was doing something outside of their intent. What this position is really saying is that if Congress leaves something underdetermined the executive must defer to the judiciary in order to understand their own rulemaking. I agree with you that the real problem here is a schlerotic political system, but in that context SCOTUS is actually making it worse by inserting itself unnecessarily into the process. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentThe executive isn't supposed to be making rules at all.

But the quibbling now is that companies can take cases to the 5th circuit for example and argue that XYZ novel chemical isn't a pollutant because it's not explicitly enumerated in the law even if it's causing vast amounts of environmental damage.

An agency is not allowed to just deem things unsafe and outlaw them. The process to determine if such a chemical is harmful or if a policy is acceptable is by way of the courts. What changed here is the agencies can no longer, unilaterally and without recourse or accountability, decide what is or is not illegal. They never had that power, yet they were allowed to pretend they did for way too long. To circumvent that process, Congress (or your state legislature in the abortion example you brought up) can and should pass laws that direct the executive branch on how to enforce the laws and what exactly they want enforced. No, laws do not need to be extremely specific as you stated, but the boundaries of enforcement should be absolute. Nobody should have to guess if an agency is going to wake up today and decide something is illegal without an actual process. In short, any argument in favor of the previous status-quo, supporting the Chevron Deference, is an argument in favor of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats deciding the laws of the land with no oversight and no recourse.

I worry that \"the normal political, legislative process\" will be the death of our planet. reply derbOac 17 hours agoparentprevThe ruling itself ironically provides an example of why it is a bad ruling: Gorsuch, authoring the majority opinion, repeatedly referred to \"nitrous oxide\" rather than nitrogen oxides. If the SCOTUS justices can't get this right, in the opinion itself, how can we expect them to make informed decisions on other scientific matters that are more complex? It also seems legally dubious to me, because there will always logically be some level at which interpretive discretion is allowed in executing some statute. Laws cannot fundamentally anticipate every single scenario to which they might be applied. It's disingenuous or naive to believe that regulation is any different at some fundamental level from any other form of statute. You can also turn your own argument on its head: if someone has a problem with a regulatory interpretation, they can always appeal it. SCOTUS could have ruled something more reasonable along these lines, to clarify how to establish abuse of regulation. I tend to be deregulatory in my political sympathies in a lot of domains, but this is not how to go about the issue, in my opinion. reply saurik 16 hours agorootparentWhy wouldn't the argument here that courts and judges aren't experts at anything not apply to every single decision they make? If we're simply going to decide that courts shouldn't be trusted to decide anything \"hard\", shouldn't our local courts also defer to local government officials? It certainly would make it easier on the District Attorney's office if the County Judges were intended to \"defer\" to their opinion on forensics, and I'm sure the local sewer district would love to not have to waste time bringing expert witnesses to court to argue their case for violation of a local ordinance. reply thatguy0900 19 hours agoparentprevPeople see congress as being so broken that anything that asks congress to act is seen as a bad thing, is the problem. reply xp84 19 hours agorootparentyou're not wrong -- basically as soon as I read 'Congress can' I immediately LOL'd.

For one, it was a very \"partisan\" ruling being a 6-3 conservative court ruling. The fishing companies' legal representation for the case includes organizations with funding linked to Charles Koch, and the side that is condemning the outcome is an environmental protection group. I'm no bootlicker. I don't side with corporations and billionaires over environmental protection groups unless there's an extremely compelling case for it. I think that while you may technically be right about the flaws in the status quo, the end result of the ruling will be that companies now have a new mechanism to litigate every bad thing they want to dump into the environment to death whereas previously the administrative regulatory agencies were able to quickly strike down nonsense like that. I think they'll have a better avenue to now claim rules are ambigious that aren't actually ambiguous, appeal appeal appeal, and just keep going at it until they find friendly or uninformed judges. And let's not forget that administrative agencies don't have a complete lack of enforceable ethics rules like the Supreme Court does. If a company wants to claim a chemical is ambiguously dangerous, they can now litigate the hell out of it all the way up to a surpreme court where a direct bribe to a judge is 100% legal. reply norir 17 hours agoparentprev> All of these controversies over Supreme Court decisions really come down to people who are advocating for positions and regulations which are unachievable through the normal political, legislative process in the US getting upset that the Supreme Court is not allowing them to enact these policies through backdoors and loopholes rather than the democratic process.

The Supreme Court needs to be gutted. reply jhawk28 19 hours agoparentChevron has been zombie precedent for years. Do you really want the interpretation of administrative law changing every four years? This is just another example of the Supreme Court telling Congress to do their job which is where the political focus should be. If you want PFAS to be cleaned up, then get your congressperson to pass a law to have the executive branch do it. It is going to be much more effective in the long run. reply lukeschlather 19 hours agorootparentDo you really want review of novel harmful chemicals to require an act of Congress to stop? PFAS are kind of iffy, the science is very mixed and it makes sense that there's going to be some flip-flopping depending on the administration. But like if there were some novel substance like DDT with similar toxcicity, that shouldn't require Congress to step in and say \"no you can't put this in the water supply.\" Seems totally reasonable that the law should simply specify what effects require regulation and leave it to the administrators to determine which substances have which effects. reply zamadatix 19 hours agorootparentCongress doesn't need to pass a law per chemical, they need to firmly and clearly pass a law to follow up with what they want that bar for review to be in a way the Supreme Court is left without a doubt of what the existing laws meant to say. The consequences of reversing Chevron definitely seem dire to me but the court's majority opinion of why they did is also pretty reasonable. reply redserk 18 hours agorootparentI'd suggest you consider reading the laws that Congress has passed to create agencies. Congress already does this. Congress does not simply write \"This bill establishes the Department of Slinky Tossing\" and lets the Executive define, without any restriction, what this agency should do. Congress would at least define this agency as responsible for launching Slinkies in a manner that is at least partially airborne for some of it's trajectory. Now here's where things get tricky, Congress must write in immutable words that must withstand decades of scrutiny on their definition. Let's say \"airborne\" was used because they did not want this agency merely cradling Slinkies into the ocean, nor did Congress want the Slinkies to remain in boxes. So in a few years of tossing Slinkies around on earth, this \"Department of Slinky Tossing\" partners with NASA to throw Slinkies around on Mars. A new opportunity arises for the true linguo-contrarian looking for a gladitorial match entrenched in establishing meaning: Congress used the term \"airborne\". Airborne requires an object being in air. But how does one define \"air\"? Did Congress intend for air to refer to the atmosphere on Earth? The gaseous atmosphere around any planet? And really, what is a planet? Could this definition of \"air\" be restricted to gaseous mixtures consumable by humans? Who knows! Now we must defer to a court to decide if the breathability of air impacts the definition of the term \"airborne\", and if the \"Department of Slinky Tossing\" is allowed to toss Slinkies on Mars simply because \"airborne\" has been ambiguously defined in both common usage and law. Unfortunately, the Department of Slinky Tossing is unable to defend itself by claiming that Congress continued to fund their wiggly experiments, which to the agency, suggests the agency was still within permissible bounds. Congress' appropriations process ensures there is an opportunity every year to refuse the \"Department of Slinky Tossing\"'s space aspirations if inter-planetary slinky tossing is a leap too far. The Court seems to disapprove of the notion that the appropriations process is Congress allowing an agency to continue to operate as it's been running. Ultimately, I think this ruling simply cements that language-pedants ought to spend their energy finding a fufilling hobby. reply zamadatix 6 hours agorootparentWhy ask if I've read the law and then come up with a story about airborne slinkies? The Chevron case itself was an already easy to explain example: lack of clear definition of source combined with lack of clear deference to the agency to decide. If the law was just written clearly then the EPA wouldn't have changed it's interpretation of what a source is over the years. If the EPA was supposed to be able to make more blanket decisions on the matter then the law needn't halfway spell out the details in that portion and just say that instead. A base assumption that every law comes with an implied \"lets the Executive define, without any restriction, what this agency should do\" is certainly not something I'd want the country to just assume (and not even something I'm sure I want any law to specify outright either...) reply skhunted 5 hours agorootparentA base assumption that every law comes with an implied \"lets the Executive define, without any restriction, what this agency should do\" is certainly not something I'd want… You badly misunderstand what Chevron deference was about and how it worked.

It is not related to my understanding of the Chevron deference. Putting it in separate paragraph was supposed to make that clear so sorry if it was left ambiguous. My understanding of the Chevron defence largely stems from and concurs with the notes in the \"Opinion of the Court\" section of https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf If you meant something else then all the same you've left no other clues to interpret what your assertion is disagreeing with or why so. reply dclowd9901 18 hours agorootparentprevAsking you as a fellow human: do you have any hope of congress actually making pressing regulation like this while companies opt to just poison people (which they historically have done over and over again?) reply zamadatix 6 hours agorootparentThe only thing that makes it pressing is congress waited ~40 years without clarifying the law and instead relying on a particular interpretation of a particular court. I don't have hope that change will now happen overnight but I do have hope it means we will not let this kind false urgency and consequences mistake repeat so much in the coming years. I'd rather we clearly set policy via our democratic branch than behold the interpretation of it to the latest courts of unelected members, even if it means one of our mistakes in that regard rears its head for a bit.

Administrative law has not changed every four years, and it is literally impossible for Congress to legislate every detail of every policy. The intent of overturning Chevron was to do away with regulations, and it's likely to work. Congress could spend a month working out the exact right policies and chemicals and requirements for PFAS, and there would still be some loophole / discovery that a chemical is slightly different than exactly what was legislated.

The requirement is not that Congress now has to write regulation about specific chemicals or specific details of every area. It's that ambiguities in the authority granted by Congress to regulatory agencies are resolved by the courts - not by the agencies themselves.

In a healthy democracy, should a legislative body have the prerogative to be general and create new agencies empowered to act on general & vague mandates? Not obvious. Congress never loses the reigns here. This is the legislative will, as they are created and financially sustained by acts of legislature, and their leadership approval and dismissal process is determined by legislature.

Removal of justices is warranted. reply zamadatix 19 hours agoparentprevAnother thing this court has highlighted is we shouldn't rest on specific legal interpretations when big and important ambiguities are raised. Whether it's the interpretation of the Constitution as protecting abortion in Roe v. Wade, whether or not the 14th amendment does or does not allow factoring race into college admissions via affirmative action in Grutter v. Bollinger, when courts must defer to agency interpretation of a law as found in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., or other such important decisions it's not something we should just leave as settled via current interpretation rather something we should seek to reinforce via updates to the law. That such important things make it to the Supreme Court to decide interpretation should be hint it may not be as clear cut as we'd like to have believed. The biggest factor in limiting the Supreme Court's power is writing laws that supersede the rulings on existing laws. If we just rest on ever increasing current interpretations of past laws to drive current policy then we are going to give an ever increasing amount of power to the judicial branch. reply EasyMark 15 hours agoparentprevExactly. Chevron was a reasonable decision and the only reason it got overturned was a concerted effort by lobbyists, billionaires, Heritage Foundation, and corporate boards to overturn something that kept them from paying for the costs of their damage to the air, water, and ecosystems where we live.

What part of that do you have a problem with? reply skhunted 15 hours agorootparentFor 40 years or so laws granting regulatory authority to federal agencies were written with the understanding that Chevron Deference was the law of the land. Now those laws grating regulatory authority are going to be considered too vague. What will happen is that regulatory agencies will be thwarted in their duty to protect the public. Where the court is headed is that they will require a level of specificity in writing laws that grant regulatory authority that is impractical. Read what the dissenting opinions were and see where they think things are headed. reply dbcurtis 14 hours agorootparentI think the reality is that regulations will become more “sticky”.

But legal experts noted that Chevron does not affect EPA enforcement actions like the Tucson order – it only affects the rule-making process. Moreover, one arm of the administration cannot sue another, so the military cannot sue the EPA, and the case would never end up in court where the Chevron decision would come into play, said Walter Mugdan, a former EPA Superfund director.

    "originBody": "Published August 13, 2024 Biden-Harris Administration announces ARPA-H awards to develop novel technologies for precise tumor removal PSI performer teams aim to deliver groundbreaking tools enabling surgeons to successfully remove tumors through a single operation The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announced the first eight teams selected by its Precision Surgical Interventions (PSI) program to receive awards. The agency’s commitment is not expected to exceed $150 million to develop novel technologies that will allow surgeons to remove cancerous tumors with higher accuracy. If successful, these technologies will revolutionize surgeries, dramatically reducing rates of repeat procedures. They can also reduce instances of unintentional injury to critical structures such as nerves, blood vessels or lymph ducts. These imaging tools may also be used to improve other types of surgeries. “From the start, ARPA-H has had a singular purpose: to drive breakthroughs in health, including cancer. Revolutionizing surgical techniques is a critical step forward towards improving detection and treatment of cancer, and improving the overall patient experience in the process,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. \"The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to reducing the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years. This goal is becoming more and more achievable thanks to breakthrough treatments and innovative technologies like these.” “With the Precision Surgical Interventions program, we're seeking to fundamentally change how surgery is done. PSI and its technical performer teams are committed to developing tools that reduce the rate of reoperations or accidental damage to critical structures,” said Ileana Hancu, Ph.D., ARPA-H PSI Program Manager. ARPA-H selected these awardees to develop methods and techniques to improve cancer detection and increase the visibility of critical anatomical structures during surgery. PSI will pursue two technical areas: cancer localization (technical areas 1-A and 1-B) and healthy structure localization (technical area 2). Technical area 1-A performers will focus on visualizing the surface of excised tumors and identifying if there are any cancer cells left. If so, the surgeon will be able to remove more tissue prior to completing the surgery. The performers will use different microscopy techniques to visualize the surface of the removed tissue with sub-cellular resolution. All images will be read and classified automatically, without the need to have pathologists in the operating room: Tulane University will build an imaging system that uses a large aperture camera and structured illumination microscopy, an imaging technique that uses patterned light to achieve high resolution in three dimensions. It takes advantage of light wave interference patterns to image entire excised tumors. The team will also develop an AI algorithm to automatically identify cancerous cells for fast data classification. Total award up to $22.9M. Rice University will build a novel microscope that images tumor slices with ultraviolet epifluorescence. They will use advanced methods to create fluorescent stains that label cells and cellular components and will develop automated AI algorithms to transform their images into ones that look similar to conventional pathology. They will also develop an automated pathology algorithm to classify the imaged cells. Total award up to $18.0M. University of Washington will develop a microscopy system to allow surgeons to image the entire surface of the tumor by placing it on a lightsheet scanner. The team is also developing algorithms to pseudo-stain the resulting images, so that the sample doesn’t need to be dyed in the operating room; instead, AI methods will take a greyscale image and render it similar to conventional pathology images in order to better classify it. Total award up to $21.1M. Technical area 1-B performers will focus on identifying microscopic cancer remnants inside the patient to help the surgeon remove all remaining cancer cells before the end of the procedure: University of California, San Francisco is inventing a microscope that uses an optical array that is pressed into the cavity’s surface. Each pixel is its own multicolor microscope. The investigators are also developing a multi-cancer dyeing agent that activates based on enzyme activity in tumors. Total award up to $15.1M. University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign will develop optical coherence tomography techniques to find suspicious tissue structures in the surgical cavity, then image those regions with nonlinear optics, which will give a multilayered view of the cells’ metabolism and structural properties. Total award up to $32.6M. Johns Hopkins University, which is performing on both technical area 1-B and technical area two, will develop a novel non-contact, photoacoustic endoscope to provide a more colorful view of the surgical field without altering the surgeons’ workflow. They will also develop a multi-cancer fluorescent contrast agent. Total award up to $20.9M. Technical area 2 performers will focus on making critical anatomy more visible to surgeons: Dartmouth College is creating a laparoscope-integrating imaging solution that will be especially helpful in prostate cancer surgeries. They will use nerve-dyeing and ureter-dyeing contrast agents, in addition to vascular dyes, to cause these critical anatomical structures to fluoresce. They will then map and visualize the 3D shape and depth of the structures. Total award up to $31.3M. Johns Hopkins University will use existing fluorescent dyes in combination with their novel photoacoustic endoscope to visualize anatomical structures for surgeons. The endoscope will ‘see’ deep into human tissue to reveal hidden blood vessels and nerves, such as they are not accidentally cut. (See above) Cision Vision will use shortwave infrared and hyperspectral images to help surgeons visualize blood vessels, nerves, and especially lymphatic structures. Going well beyond red, green, and blue, hyperspectral imaging is enhanced by AI algorithms. This would allow the team to distinguish between tissue types without administering dyes. Total award up to $22.3M. “With PSI, we aim to reduce surgical errors significantly and achieve better health outcomes across cancer and other diseases,” said ARPA-H Director Renee Wegrzyn, Ph.D. “Surgical procedures are often the first treatment option for some two million Americans diagnosed with cancer each year. This lack of precision can lead to repeat surgeries, harder recoveries, cancer recurrence, and higher health care costs. Our hope is to advance cancer surgery so that we remove cancer the first time and every time.” The PSI program mandates that all performers design solutions that are compatible with all users. For example, if designing a tool for surgeons, the tool must fit different hand sizes. PSI mandates that all performers also be committed to equitable access and the development of medical devices that will be useable in virtually any hospital. As such, PSI performers must prioritize lower-cost solutions in their designs and test their devices in a rural hospital during the program. Furthermore, the devices must be validated in patient populations that reflect the demographics of the disease studied. The performers’ awards are ceilings, based on each performer meeting its contractual milestones. ARPA-H’s total investment is not expected to exceed $150M.

    "originBody": "COMPUTING FEATURE OF MODES AND MEN Cut-and-paste, the one-button mouse, WYSIWIG desktop publishing—these are just a few of the user interface innovations pioneered by Larry Tesler TEKLA S. PERRY01 AUG 200520 MIN READ Iconography: In 1973 Larry Tesler predicted that icons would replace the lists of names then typical of computer interfaces. Variants of the trash-can icon have since become ubiquitous PHOTO: BRIAN SMALE LIKE WOODY ALLEN’S 1983 movie character, Zelig, who appears at every significant historical event of his era, Larry Tesler has had a hand in major events making computer history during the past 30 years. When the first document-formatting software was developed at Stanford University in 1971, Tesler was coding it. When a secretary first cut and pasted some text on a computer screen at Xerox Corp.’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 1973, Tesler was looking over her shoulder. When the first portable computer was turned on in an airport waiting area (and on an airplane), Tesler had his fingers on the keyboard. When Steve Jobs went to PARC in 1979 to see the legendary demo that is purported to have set the stage for a revolution in computing, Tesler had his hand on the mouse. And when Apple Computer Inc.’s infamous Newton handheld computer failed spectacularly in the early 1990s, taking millions of dollars of investment and a few careers down with it, Tesler was there, too. Hey, nobody gets it right 100 percent of the time. Larry Tesler (IEEE Member) Date of Birth: 24 April 1945 Birthplace: Bronx, New York Height: 178 centimeters Family: wife, Colleen; daughter, Lisa Education: B.S. in mathematics, Stanford University, 1965 Patents: three, related to Apple Newton Hero: Steve Jobs Most recent book read: Creation: Life and How to Make It, by Steve Grand Favorite author: Tom Robbins First Job: medical librarian, Knickerbocker Hospital, New York, N.Y. Computer: Mac PowerBook How his wife describes him: “Too patient” Bet you didn't know: he once funded a project to build a computer for a really smart gorilla. The Gorilla Foundation researchers working with Koko, a lowland gorilla taught American Sign Language in 1972, thought it would be interesting to see if Koko's language skills could be translated to a computer touch screen. Tesler authorized a few cohorts at Apple to build a rugged computer, based on the Macintosh, to do so. Koko found operating the simple software they provided yawningly easy. Years later, Tesler joined the board of the Gorilla Foundation and continues to serve on it. So why haven’t you heard of him? [see sidebar, \"Larry's Lexicon\"]. “Larry generated a lot of the basic ideas for the work we were doing,” says Douglas Fairbairn, a former colleague at PARC. “But he doesn’t have a big ego, so his name didn’t get attached to things. He wasn’t the one guy who did one big thing you’ll remember him for; he was a collaborator on many things.” This past May, Tesler joined Yahoo Inc., in Sunnyvale, Calif., as vice president of user experience and design. At Yahoo, Tesler has perhaps his biggest opportunity yet to shape the way hundreds of millions of people interact with technology as they search the Web, watch and listen to media, share things they’ve created or found, correspond with family and friends, and even find love through the Internet. When Tesler was a child, his parents couldn’t quite figure him out, so they had him tested by a career counselor. The counselor told them that the results were unusual—Tesler registered a strange combination of sensitivity to people and fascination with math. The best career choice the counselor could suggest was working as an architect or maybe becoming a certified public accountant. The field of computer usability did not yet exist. At the time, people had to learn arcane codes to communicate with computers, typically via punch cards and printouts. The idea of making a computer easy for the average person to use was still a new one when Tesler came along. “I was born to do it and feel very lucky to have been in the right place at the right time,” he says. It’s a recurring theme in his career, starting with Stanford University, in California, in the early 1960s. Computer time was available free of charge to anybody who wanted it, and Tesler, a math major, wanted it very much. He wrote a few little programs for his own amusement, and he programmed enhancements to the software that created graphic patterns for the 3465-seat card section at Stanford Stadium. Soon he got a paid job in Stanford’s computer laboratory developing software that would make strings of computer code easier for humans to read, by formatting the text into either fixed-width columns or free-form lines. It wasn’t a new idea, he says, just a nicer implementation of an old idea. But this was the first bit of computer code Tesler wrote that was meant to be used by large numbers of people. And he was hooked, by programming in general and by text formatting in particular. Text formatting—the ability to display or print out type in different sizes and with different fonts, spacing, and so on—doesn’t generally get much attention in treatises on how the computer has transformed civilization. But it is actually one of the most common computer functions and the foundation of such programs as Microsoft Word. After college in the early 1960s, Tesler spent a few years working as a computer consultant. As one of only four listed in the Palo Alto, Calif., area phone book, he got a lot of calls. He wrote programs that scheduled classroom use for the San Jose school district and that simulated the distribution of nuclear fallout for the Stanford Research Institute (now called SRI International). Larry’s Lexicon A NUMBER OF WORDS NOW COMMONLY USED TO REFER TO COMPUTER ATTRIBUTES OR ACTIONS WERE FIRST USED IN THE COMPUTING ARENA BY LARRY TESLER. Browser: When Tesler was developing his page-paste-up system at Xerox PARC, researcher Alan Kay would repeatedly complain that no one had found a good way to browse on a computer, in the way that you can browse through books at a library. One day another researcher, Diana Merry, quoted Kay to Tesler, “No one has ever come up with a good way to browse.” Tesler responded, “I am so sick of hearing that. I’m going to implement a browser.” And that was the first use of the term. Tesler developed the Smalltalk Code Browser to solve his frustration with Smalltalk’s development. The word browser eventually migrated to the Web world. Cut-and-paste: In 1969 Tesler volunteered to help create a catalog for the Bay Area’s Mid-Peninsula Free University. He and Jim Warren, founder of the West Coast Computer Faire, did the paste-up for that catalog. Around the same time, Tesler saw a demo of a computer command that allowed you to bring back something that you had deleted. The command was called “Escape P Semicolon” (or something similarly arcane). Several years later, when Tesler was at Xerox PARC writing a white paper about the future of computing, he drew on the memory of those two experiences to predict that you would be able to “cut and paste” within computer documents. Modeless: Computer scientists when writing code typically worked in different modes; you might have an insert mode, a delete mode, or a replace mode. You would first select the mode, then select the point on the screen at which the action was to occur, then perform the action. Tesler, in user experiments, proved that modes were confusing for nonscientific users and championed the “modeless” interface. User-friendly: In 1974, a Xerox Corp. salesman, assigned to sell the company’s new product, a word processor, came to PARC complaining about how hard the devices were to use. Tesler’s colleagues sent the salesman to talk with Tesler, who had a reputation for being passionate about ease of use. The salesman said to Tesler, “It’s really hard to sell this stuff, the software is just so unfriendly.” “Unfriendly?” Tesler responded. “That’s an interesting way to think about it. So you want friendly software, software that is friendly to the user.” From that day on Tesler started to throw the word “friendly” into every report he wrote, and it moved into the lexicon, hitting Time magazine in 1975, when a Xerox executive said the goal of PARC was to make software friendly to the user. Tesler came to regret this coinage in the 1980s, when every software advertisement used the term user-friendly, whether appropriate or not. But these days he thinks it’s cool. What-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWIG): At Xerox PARC in the 1970s, Tesler and his colleagues often complained that when they printed out documents, the documents looked nothing like what they had seen on the computer screen. Tesler recalls saying, “What you see on the screen should be what you get when you print it.” A listener, he recalls, said, “You mean ‘What you see is what you get.’” So while Tesler is credited by history for first using these words to refer to computer documents, it was the now-anonymous listener who coined the phrase. “It was, however, in response to my complaining,” Tesler says. It became widely used at Xerox PARC, in spite of objections from one researcher who pointed out that because the phrase originally referred to houses of prostitution, it was inappropriate. Around 1980, John Seybold, another computer typesetting pioneer, shortened the phrase to WYSIWYG. —T.S.P. When the Silicon Valley recession of the late 1960s dried up consulting contracts, he managed to find a job at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, where he considered how computers might be made to understand natural human language and even to express simulated human thoughts and feelings. “This work was technically fascinating,” Tesler recalls, “but one day I woke up and realized that this stuff wouldn’t be practical for decades.” And he had bigger woes, too: by 1970 his brief marriage to his college sweetheart had broken up. He packed his 5-year-old daughter and her favorite toys into his aging Dodge Dart and moved to Oregon, joining a wave of Vietnam-era dropouts. There, he and a group of friends bought land and began building their own houses. Eventually, he had a nice house but no savings. That was when he noticed that there was only one computer within a 60-kilometer radius, at a bank. The bank wouldn’t hire him, so Tesler called his former colleagues at the Stanford AI laboratory for help. He hadn’t been in touch with them for six months. “Did you know that Xerox started a computer research center in Palo Alto?” one asked Tesler. “About a week after you left for Oregon, Alan Kay, who planned to go to Xerox himself, came here looking for you.” Kay, now a senior fellow with Hewlett-Packard Co., in Palo Alto, recalls that he even went to Oregon to try to track Tesler down. Kay had worked briefly at the Stanford AI lab and had considered Tesler “one of the most interesting intellectuals and one of the best programmers there.” Tesler immediately contacted Robert Taylor, director of the computer science laboratory at PARC, asking for a part-time job, so he could continue to live in Oregon. But PARC would consider Tesler only for full-time positions; Tesler wasn’t interested. A month later, still jobless, he reconsidered, but by then Xerox had instituted a hiring freeze. The opportunity was gone. Tesler went back to the Stanford AI lab, hoping he could find something to do there that was more “real” than advanced research. The lab manager, Les Earnest, was interested in computer typesetting, a nascent technology at the time, and assigned Tesler to develop a “document compiler,” something that could format text and generate footnotes, tables of contents, indexes, and bibliographies. So in 1971 Tesler wrote a piece of software that would allow users to tuck formatting commands inside normal text as they typed, like inserting a parenthetical expression. When the computer displayed or printed text coded in this manner, it would adjust the text as instructed—boldface or italic, for example—and hide the instruction. This software, called Pub, was one of the first, if not the first, of what would become a “markup language with embedded tags and scripting.” The best-known such language today is Dynamic HTML, used in Web design. Pub was distributed through the ARPANet, a precursor to the Internet, and widely used in universities. Tesler continued to check in with PARC, and at the end of 1971, Xerox offered him a job in the On-Line Office System Group, then building an ambitious distributed operating system for office applications. Tesler was interested in personal computers, so the project didn’t thrill him. And he thought the offered pay was too low. So he turned PARC down. Again. More than a year went by. It was early 1973, and PARC was in the thick of developing what would be the first personal computer, the Alto. It made Tesler yet another job offer, and this time he didn’t refuse. He would split his time between the Office System Group and Alan Kay’s Learning Research Group. One goal of the Learning Research Group was to develop Smalltalk, the first dynamic object-oriented programming language—the first language, that is, designed to create programming entities that had characteristics and attributes that could be passed on to other entities. A generic “job” entity, for example, might have such attributes as a salary, a department, and health benefits. Another entity, such as “manager,” could be created, automatically inheriting those attributes and gaining additional ones, such as supervisory duties or security clearances. Smalltalk back in the 1970s contained almost all of the concepts in today’s enormously popular Java language. As one of Tesler’s first tasks at PARC, he and a co-worker wrote a paper on the future of interactive computing, which for the first time talked about cut-and-paste as a way of moving blocks of text, images, and the like. It also described representing documents and other office objects stored on the computer as tiny images—icons—instead of as a list of names [see photo, ]. Today, icons are everywhere—as folders, documents, and the trash can or recycle bin for deleted files. The radicalness of the concepts is apparent only when you understand that, in those days, opening up a document required knowing—and typing in—its exact name and document type. Before Tesler arrived, the Office System Group had already formulated some ideas about how they expected users to interact with computers. Their concept was based on the three-button mouse and depended heavily on the use of modes. In a mode-based system, you first tell the computer what type of thing you are going to do, and then you do it. So if you want to insert text in a document, you put the computer in insert mode, select your insert point, type in the text, and then exit the insert mode. If you want to delete, you put the computer in delete mode, select the text to be removed, execute the deletion, and exit the mode. It could take weeks or months to become proficient in the use of the system, but at the time, practitioners believed nothing much simpler than that could offer as much power to the user. “I was aghast,” Tesler says. He reasoned that ordinary users wouldn’t invest more than a few minutes in learning a user interface and that they would lose track of modes, risking deleting instead of inserting, for example, with potentially disastrous results. But Tesler found few allies among his colleagues, who, incredibly to Tesler, felt that a moded interface was intuitive. Meanwhile, PARC hired Sylvia Adams, now Sylvia Amundsen, a secretary whose previous high-tech experience had been limited to the IBM Selectric typewriter. When she arrived for her first day of work, Tesler recalls, “I grabbed her. I didn’t want her to get contaminated by some word processor that we were using.” He sat her in front of a blank computer screen and gave her a printed page of text that he had marked up with corrections. “See this text?” he asked. “Pretend it’s on the screen. And see these proofreading marks? Your job is to make those changes on the screen. How would you do it?” “Well,” she said, “I have to insert something there, so I would point there, and then I would type what I wanted. And to delete this, I would draw through it.” Tesler took notes as Adams invented, in effect, the modeless user interface for text editing. Then Tesler had her use the moded system in use at PARC. She hated it; she got stuck frequently in the wrong mode and had trouble getting out of it. She proved his theory that it was a bad system for a nontechnical beginner. The test was enough to convince Tesler’s boss, Bill English, to allow Tesler to work on an alternative to the moded interface. As he developed it, he continued his user experiments, regularly grabbing “civilians” from the building lobby—delivery people, friends picking up employees for lunch, anybody without computer experience. Tesler sat them down in front of a computer screen now running prototype software and asked them to edit text. “They were such novices,” Tesler recalls. “With one couple, the first thing they said when looking at the crisp text on the screen was, ‘You get really good TV reception in here.’” After writing a simple text editor called Mini Mouse, he went on to develop Gypsy, a modeless text-processing system that was the first to use many now-familiar elements: the cut-and-paste function to move text, a fill-in form to enter search terms, selection of text by holding down a mouse button and dragging the cursor through it, bold and italic type styles, and what-you-see-is-what-you-get printing. Tesler coined that phrase and other now-common terms. Gypsy also first implemented click-to-open files; previously, the only way to open a file was to type its name and the Open command. Gypsy was never commercialized, but it was used for years to edit manuscripts at Ginn and Co., a textbook publisher then owned by Xerox. Tesler went on to develop other pathbreaking text-formatting software, but none of it made it to market. In the mid-1970s, the Holy Grail of Kay’s Learning Research Group at PARC was the Dynabook. A name dreamed up by Kay, Dynabook was to be a portable computer smaller than today’s laptops. It would do just about everything anyone could then imagine a computer doing, including storing everything you needed on a daily basis and communicating with other computers when necessary. It was a pretty audacious idea. At the time, PARC’s Alto, one of the smallest stand-alone computers then in existence, was about the size and weight of a hotel minibar refrigerator. The Dynabook was clearly way off in the future. “I was born to do it and feel very lucky to have been in the right place at the right time.” Kay regarded the 1973 Alto as an interim Dynabook that did the right things but was too big to carry around. In 1978 Kay and his colleague, Adele Goldberg, felt it was finally possible to build the next computer that would lead to Dynabook: Notetaker. It would be portable, use floppy disks (then a brand-new storage medium), and run on batteries. It would have only one function—it would allow students to take notes. PARC’s Fairbairn set out to design the hardware and enlisted Tesler to assist. Tesler didn’t know a whole lot about hardware; his entire hardware engineering experience consisted of once building a joystick. Fairbairn, a hardware pro, said, “Hey, it’s not hard,” and handed him a manual for the just-introduced Intel 8086, which was to become the first commercially successful 16-bit microprocessor. Tesler read the manual and designed the circuitry for the processor board while Fairbairn worked on the many other boards, interfaces, and specialized hardware needed. Within a week of the release of sample chips, the processor board was wrapped. And it didn’t work. The fault was neither Tesler’s nor his prototype software’s. The Intel documentation had numbered the pins on a peripheral chip backward, and as the first developer to build a prototype, Tesler was the one who found the bug. Because the PARC researchers’ vision for the Dynabook included networking, the Notetaker was to include an Ethernet card. Existing ones contained more than 100 chips. But the size constraints for a portable machine meant the Notetaker’s Ethernet card could hold 24 chips, tops. Tesler decided to move a number of functions to software, ending up needing only 20 chips. In effect, he had come up with the first software implementation of the Ethernet protocol. The Notetaker worked; 10 prototypes were built, and Tesler and Fairbairn went on the road. They crisscrossed the country, visiting Xerox executives in several locations, trying to convince someone—anyone—that Notetaker should be a product. Some executives seemed excited but took no action beyond referring the duo to others. This went on for months. Road Warrior: Larry Tesler and cohort Douglas Fairbairn were the first ever to use a portable computer in an airport and on an airplane.PHOTO: BRIAN SMALE One night in 1979, in the midst of this road show, Tesler and Fairbairn were sitting in the gate area at San Francisco International Airport, waiting to board their red-eye flight to New York City. Because the Notetaker was a secret project, they had never turned the 16-kilogram computer on outside of a Xerox building. But the gate area was nearly empty. So they opened up Notetaker, powered it up from its built-in battery, ran its Smalltalk program, and quickly turned it off again [see photo, \"Road Warrior\"]. “That was the first time a portable computer was ever used in an airport,” Tesler says. “We think.” The duo couldn’t resist, Fairbairn says, turning the computer on again, during that flight. History was made once again. The flight attendants didn’t even notice. By the Fall of 1979, it had become clear that Xerox executives just weren’t buying the Notetaker. They had their hands full competing with an onslaught of low-cost copiers from Asia. Meanwhile, in December 1979, Steve Jobs and his colleagues from Apple Computer Inc., in Cupertino, Calif., took their now-famous tour of PARC. Tesler was on hand to demonstrate the Alto’s user interface. “The questions the Apple people were asking totally blew me away,” Tesler says. “They were the kind of questions Xerox executives should have been asking but didn’t. They asked: ‘Why don’t the windows refresh automatically? Why did you do the menus this way?’” “And the question I remember most was from Steve Jobs. He said, ’You guys are sitting on a gold mine here. Why aren’t you making this a product?’” After that meeting, Tesler decided that his next job would be at Apple. He would stay at PARC long enough to get them to accept the Notetaker, finish the page layout system still in development, and give a scheduled talk at the 1980 Association for Computing Machinery Siggraph conference, the big annual meeting for the computer graphics community. The Siggraph talk was key, Tesler felt, because he had for the first time obtained permission from Xerox to publicly demonstrate some of the word-processing and text-formatting programs developed at PARC. He believed this demonstration would take trade secret status away from PARC’s pioneering concepts, thereby allowing him to work on similar technology at Apple without breaking his confidentiality agreement. He wasn’t the only researcher talking about leaving PARC in the early 1980s. Kay recalls that life at PARC was getting to be more and more of a strain. Tesler started working for Apple shortly after his Siggraph speech. Bruce Daniels, the software manager on the Lisa personal computer project, hired him. “There was no question that we would hire him,” recalls Daniels, now a program manager at Sun Microsystems Inc., in Menlo Park, Calif. “We didn’t need to interview him. We had seen this vision at PARC, we loved it, but how could we build it? He knew everything; he was this font of wisdom, he could answer any question, he was passionate—it was the proverbial match made in heaven.” Lisa, released in 1983, was technologically dazzling. Coming just a year after Xerox’s successor to the Alto, the Star office workstation, Lisa was the first commercially available personal computer that, like the networked office Star, used windows, icons, and a mouse—all the elements of the graphical user interface that we now take for granted. Ultimately, though, the US $8000 system was commercially unsuccessful. Apple stopped manufacturing the Lisa after only two years; just 30,000 had been sold. In the Lisa group, Tesler contributed to “absolutely everything,” Daniels says [see photo, \"Larry and Lisa\"]. Tesler, more modestly, says that Bill Atkinson and Jef Raskin were well into the Lisa interface design when he got there, but he feels he had some influence. He talked them into using cut-and-paste, he recalls, and wrote a memo that argued persuasively for the one-button mouse, a concept that Tesler had advocated at PARC and that Raskin had been promoting at Apple. Larry and Lisa: The team responsible for the design of Apple’s Lisa Computer, released in 1983, included Larry Tesler (far right).PHOTO: ROGER RESSMEYER/CORBIS “I had asked him to suggest how many buttons should go on the mouse,” Daniels recalls. “I made the decision based on his comments, and the Apple mouse still has just one button.” Tesler brought his idea of click-and-drag for selecting things over from PARC as well, along with the pop-up menus that had been used in Smalltalk. He designed the software widget that makes windows divisible (as is commonplace now in the spreadsheet program Microsoft Excel). And when Atkinson was working on the menu bar, trying to attach it to windows in such a way that it wouldn’t obscure text or get too small, Tesler pointed to the top of the screen. “I said, ‘It should be at the top,’” he recalls. “It should be there, always in the same place.” Atkinson implemented the menu bar that night, and by dawn he had come up with menus that dropped down as you dragged the mouse and shortcut keys. “He invented the whole thing,” Tesler says, “but I gave him the inspiration.” Meanwhile, the Macintosh project, for a cheaper computer than the Lisa, geared up. Tesler was not officially part of it; he continued to develop software for the Lisa group. But he spent one day a week in the Mac building critiquing the user interface under development. Convinced by tests with ordinary users, the Mac designers ultimately decided to base the Mac interface on Lisa, with a menu bar at the top and folders and documents on the screen, instead of the metaphor then being tried—a large picture of a floppy disk taking up most of the screen, with icons of documents scattered on top of it. In 1986 Tesler was named vice president of Apple’s newly formed Advanced Technology Group, the group that contributed to the design of the next-generation product, the Macintosh II. At one point, researchers hooked 24 Mac IIs together to render an animated short, called Pencil Test, which was shown at the 1988 Siggraph conference. Movie director John Lasseter, more recently of Pixar fame, advised on the project; at the time, he was dating a woman in the group (whom he later married). Struggles in doing Pencil Test, particularly in synchronizing sound and video, led to another small research group, the Time Lords. The software that the Time Lords developed was called QuickTime, a form of which still ships with every Macintosh computer and is also widely used on Windows computers. With Tesler at the helm, the Advanced Technology Group grew to some 200 people. One of the many projects under development was a full-function handheld Mac. A prototype was up and running when Tesler made what he recalls as one of the worst decisions of his career: he killed the project. Instead, he devoted himself to the development of the Newton, a handheld computer that was to be based on a new technology incompatible with the Macintosh line of computers. The year was 1990. Tesler had just taken over management of the Newton project, which had been under way for several months. Apple president Jean-Louis Gassee, who had championed the project, had just quit the company; the Newton project leader left a week later. “I did a few things right at the beginning of that project,” Tesler recalls, “and then I made an unbelievable series of mistakes.” Competition between the handheld Mac group and the Newton group had developed; it was obvious that one had to go. Tesler had to choose which. The handheld Mac worked; the Newton was still just research. However, Newton proponents convinced him that the handheld Mac was a dead end, because it ran an old version of the Mac operating system and wasn’t going to be powerful enough to run the new version when it came out. The handheld Mac was relegated to history, and all bets were on the Newton. “I did a few things right at the beginning of that project,” Tesler recalls, “and then I made an unbelievable series of mistakes.” When Tesler joined the Newton group, the computer was envisioned as a 20- by 28-centimeter machine, weighing about 3 kilograms and selling for over $7000. He insisted developers get the price down to $1000, and he worked out an arrangement to obtain processors designed by Acorn Computer Ltd., in Cambridge, England. He even convinced Apple to invest in a newly created company, Advanced RISC Machines Ltd., also in Cambridge, that would produce them. That, Tesler recalled, was one of his good decisions, as was taking the nascent spread-spectrum wireless communications technology being developed for the Newton and moving it into the Advanced Technology Group. That project team eventually joined with development teams in other companies and created the Wi-Fi wireless local-area network standard. Then the mistakes began. For one, Tesler killed an internal handwriting recognition project, but he didn’t give up on handwriting recognition altogether. Instead, he licensed technology from ParaGraph, a company founded in Moscow. It didn’t work on Newton’s relatively slow processor. Looking back, he says he should have realized that while the Newton technology had great potential, it was too immature for a product that needed to get out the door. Eventually, the Newton handheld computer was released. “And it was a disaster,” Tesler recalls. He left the group just before the product was shipped, because at that point he was against releasing the product at all. He stayed at Apple for four more years as chief scientist. “It was a consolation prize,” he says. He proposed a number of projects; none got funded. Eventually, he took on the job of managing network products, a profitable business but one without the risk-taking innovation that excited him. His final task before quitting in 1997 was to shut down the Advanced Technology Group; the company felt it could no longer afford basic research. While closing the group, Tesler became enamored with one project, a programming language called Cocoa. Like many of his technical loves, Cocoa embraced object-oriented programming. But unusually for such a language, Cocoa was to be used to allow schoolchildren, with no previous programming experience, to easily create their own simulations and video games. With Apple’s blessing, Tesler spun Cocoa off into a company, Stagecast Software Inc., now in Burlingame, Calif. The software was renamed Stagecast Creator. It was aimed to the then-hot creativity and education market. It is still available and today is a standard tool in computer camps. The group moved into offices in Palo Alto in 1997. Tesler met with potential investors, developed marketing strategies, reviewed code under development, and even bought the office trash cans. Unfortunately for Stagecast, the product was released in 1999, just as the education software market went bust. By mid-2000, it was clear that Stagecast wasn’t going to be able to support its 15 employees, much less make a fortune for its investors. Even though the product was loved by its users and won countless awards, the market was just too small. “Millions of dollars went down the drain,” says Tesler, who never drew a salary from Stagecast, “including a lot of my personal money. A friend had told me that if I wasn’t willing to invest half my assets in an idea, I didn’t believe in it enough. And the more my investors and I sank into it, the more I felt that some day we’d figure out how to turn the corner. But after the market crash, what had been a fraction of my wealth suddenly became almost all of it.” Still, he had no plans to leave, thinking he would stay with the company, maintain the product, and eventually find a buyer. His wife finally intervened. “She told me, ‘Stop dreaming, it’s over,’” he recalls. “And she got me to face the fact that I was just going to have to walk away.” So he left. Two employees remained and, to date, make enough from keeping the product on the market to support themselves modestly. Meanwhile, a recruiter put Tesler in touch with Amazon.com Inc. At first, he was hesitant. He perceived Amazon as a retail company, and he didn’t know anything about retail. Besides, the job was at the company’s home office in Seattle, about 1300 km north of his home in Portola Valley, Calif. But, at the urging of a former Apple co-worker who was at Amazon, Tesler went to Seattle to meet with several people, and he was hooked. “When I got there, it was very clear that Amazon is a technology company that happens to be a retailer,” he says. And while they couldn’t do much more than hint about it, Tesler felt that Amazon was getting ready to do something interesting in user interface design. He joined Amazon in October 2001 as an engineering vice president and spent his first few months getting his bearings. He then took on the position of vice president of shopping experience, focusing on the usability of Amazon’s Web site. He contributed to the recent launch of the tool that allows customers to search within books, as well as other user interface developments that are still confidential. He loved it, particularly, he says, “going home and realizing that tens of millions of people are going to be using what I just worked on.” It’s a recurring theme with him: the sheer delight of knowing that people use his work. His happiest memories from the Stagecast years were of trips to classrooms where kids were using his software. He still gets a little thrill when friends mention how they found what they needed at Amazon. This past spring Tesler left Amazon. His problem wasn’t with the company but rather with having a job in Seattle and a wife and roots in Silicon Valley. In May he joined Yahoo. Will he have his hand in another interface revolution there? Changing the way people do things is never easy. Says Daniels: “You have to have the ability to guess years ahead and the self-assurance that you are right.” Tesler, Daniels thinks, can do that. And so does Yahoo. Yahoo expects Tesler to spark innovations all over the company. “There’s never been a more exciting time for user interaction innovators,” Tesler says. “What we create today may not be as seminal as what we created 30 years ago. But the challenges are greater, and the solutions will have immediate impact on a lot of people.” Besides, he says, “It should be fun.” PARCAPPLESOFTWARE",

Anyway, hard to blame the folks who invented it, since it was early days, but WYSIWYG was a truly terrible idea. It heavily implies the need (although, doesn’t technically demand it) to have user input produce only local changes, so we’ve been cursed with all these office documents with terrible spacing. It also ruins our ability to actually communicate with the computer, or describe things on an abstract level. People just poke their documents around until they get something reasonably sensible looking in their current editor. Is the text reflowed around the figure or did the user just manually add a bunch of line breaks and then manually paste in the figure (anchored to what?). We’ll out later if somebody changes the font. Maybe WYSIWIG almost works, actually. What you see is… whatever I got. Except it only works if we have the same version of the same office suite. reply AlbertCory 36 minutes agoparentWYSIWIG was revolutionary in its time.

Everyone knows what cut and paste are, no one thinks about the fact that someone had to come up with it. reply amszmidt 6 hours agoparentprevLimited, and also wrong -- Tesler didn't invent any of those. They existed already by 1973 (supposed date of these inventions at Xerox PARC); e.g. TECO from MIT and E from Yale had functionality for cutting/pasting, replacing strings, etc. reply II2II 5 hours agorootparentThe wording of the article suggests that he came up with the term \"cut and paste\", rather than the concept: > In 1969 Tesler volunteered to help create a catalog for the Bay Area’s Mid-Peninsula Free University. He and Jim Warren, founder of the West Coast Computer Faire, did the paste-up for that catalog. Around the same time, Tesler saw a demo of a computer command that allowed you to bring back something that you had deleted. The command was called “Escape P Semicolon” (or something similarly arcane). Several years later, when Tesler was at Xerox PARC writing a white paper about the future of computing, he drew on the memory of those two experiences to predict that you would be able to “cut and paste” within computer documents. reply ralferoo 6 hours agorootparentprevAlso, I don't think it particularly counts as an invention as it was heavily used in publishing well before the computer era, and was just shifting to a computing context and re-using the same metaphor. For a long time, text was printed in sections, physically cut up and pasted to a board, and when the entire page was assembled it was photographed to create a negative that was used to print the newspaper. Just to be clear that I'm not intending to disrespect his work, just arguing the semantic meaning of \"invention\" with respect to this. His obsession with mode-less user interfaces and user-facing simplicity is far more significant a contribution to society in general (and ironically, cut-and-paste is almost the antithesis of his main philosophy as the once-cut data becomes hidden state - it'd be a better metaphor to highlight the data and physically move it around the document). reply nusl 6 hours agoparentprevThe article does mention other things, though it makes sense that they would highlight what he's most-famous for. reply shortformblog 3 hours agoprevI wrote a remembrance when he died a few years back. The timing of this story (2005) is a little unfortunate, because the genius of the Newton investment only showed itself later, even with its failure: https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7jdgw/larry-tesler-the-inve... See, Apple invested in ARM because of the Newton, which means they held Newton stock. And on top of the fact that this gave Apple an inside line/competitive advantage with ARM that we’re still seeing today, it also meant that Apple owned ARM stock—and could sell it. When the company was near its nadir in the late 1990s, it nursed itself back to health by selling shares of ARM. So even Tesler’s biggest failure was a stroke of genius. reply sleepybrett 2 hours agoparentI have an old messagepad (110) and ran across it a few months back when I was going through some of my storage boxes.

I think there is some kind of psychological thing driving this. Like subconsciously, I came to the conclusion many years ago that \"real programmers\" use vim or Emacs, and then consciously decided that the default keybindings for Emacs were slightly worse. So for decades I have been trying to learn just enough vim to get by. But practically every day I miss my PC keys for things like selecting text. At least three times I have got my keybindings the way I wanted and then after a new install or something just decided to deal with the outdated way that vim does it. You have to realize the context that vim was invented. There was no WYSIWYG. People were used to things like 'ed' where everything was a command. Just being able to stay in a mode and move around freely on the screen was a big deal.

    "originBody": "Blog 350M Tokens Don't Lie: Love And Hate In Hacker News Community Foundation Models August 13, 2024 · 14 min read The Outerbounds Team tl;dr We analyzed all Hacker News posts with more than five comments between January 2020 and June 2023. Leveraging LLama3 70B LLM, we examined both the posts and their associated comments to gain insights into how the Hacker News community engages with different topics. You can download the datasets we produced at the bottom of the article. Use the tool below to explore various topics and the sentiments they evoke. The sentiment column reports the median sentiment score, 0 being the most negative sentiment and 9 the most positive. Click on the column headers to discover topics that inspire strong reactions, whether positive or negative, and to identify divisive subjects that tend to generate polarized commentary. Motivation If you have been following Hacker News for a while, you have likely developed an intuition for the topics that the community loves - and topics the community loves to hate. If you port Factorio to run on ZX Spectrum using Rust, you will be overwhelmed with love and karma. On the other hand, you better don an asbestos suit if, instead of raising a funding round, you sell your startup to a private equity company so they can add telemetry in the codebase to power targeted ads. But that's just a hazy intuition! Since the community is a big believer in rationality and data science (the phrase is divisive though), we would be in a stronger position if we could back our hunch with proper data analysis. Also, it would give us an excuse to play with large language models which, all the AI hype aside, are mind-blowingly effective at practical tasks like this. And, we happen to be developers of an open source tool, Metaflow, written in Python, which makes it fun and educational to hack projects like this. Type the bolded phrases in the textbox above to see if we are optimizing for an appropriate emotional response. What topics trend on Hacker News? As described in the implementation section below, we downloaded about 100,000 pages posted on Hacker News to understand what content resonates with the community. We focus on posts that gained at least 20 upvotes and 5 comments, prompting a large language model to come up with ten phrases that best describe each page. Here are the top 20 topics, aggregated from the 100,000 pages, along with the number of posts covering each topic: The top topics are hardly surprising. However, the community is known for having diverse intellectual interests. The top 20 topics represent only 10% of the topics covered across posts. You can see this by yourself by using the tool above that cover all the 14,000 topics that are associated with at least five posts. Have the top topics evolved over time? You bet. Here are the top-10 trending topics: Even though the dataset only extends to June 2023, we can see a tsunami of AI, natural language processing, and related topics. Sadly, layoffs started trending mid-2022 as well. The rise of AI articles likely explains the growth in the Technology topic as well. What's declining In 2020-2022, an overwhelming macro-trend was everything related to the COVID pandemic which fortunately is not a pressing issue anymore. Fascinatingly, August 2021 was a tumultuous month with especially Apple's proposed CSAM scanning causing an uproar in posts related to Privacy and Apple. If you want to take a trip down the memory lane, consider the past topics on the left which haven't been covered once since January 2022: Before Jan 2022 📉 After Jan 2022 📈 George Floyd GPT-4 Herd immunity Stable Diffusion Antibodies Russia-Ukraine War IOS 14 Ventura Freenode Bank Failure Suez Canal Midjourney Wallstreetbets Hiring Freeze Hydroxychloroquine FIDO Alliance Infection rates Cost of living crisis Correspondingly, the topics on the right didn't exist before January 2022. It doesn't take a PhD in Economics to understand how Wallstreetbets got replaced by Cost of living crisis, Hiring freeze, and Bank failure. But how do people feel about these topics Importantly, sharing or upvoting a post doesn't imply endorsement - often the opposite. Hence to truly understand the dynamics of a community, we need to analyze how people react to posts, as expressed through their comments. To do this, we reconstructed comment threads associated with the posts in the dataset and asked an LLM to classify the sentiment of the discourse between 0 and 9, zero being an all-out flamewar and nine indicating a perfect harmony and positivity. Our dutiful LLM took the job as a virtual community moderator and went through 100k comment threads in about 9 hours, reading through 230M words consisting of the full emotional gamut of bitterness, passion, wisdom, humor, and love. Here's what the LLM came back with in terms of the distribution of sentiments: Firstly, the LLM is utterly befuddled about what a neutral discussion looks like - there are no 5 in the results. Or, maybe this is a snarky note by the LLM noting that humans are incapable of unemotional, unbiased discourse. Secondly, the sentiments are clearly skewed towards the positive side, which aligns with our personal experience with the site. The bias to positivity and optimism is a key reason why we open Hacker News daily. There's enough vitriol elsewhere. It is also worth noting that at least some of the few ones assigned by the machine seem to be bogus. For instance, this post by BentoML was given a score of one, although the sentiment seems majorly positive and supportive. All the usual caveats about LLMs apply. Love and hate in Hacker News Now with the topics and the sentiment scores at hand, we can finally give a scientific answer to the question of what the community loves and loves to hate: Love 😍 Hate 😠 Programming FTX Computer Science Police Misconduct Open Source Sam Bankman-Fried Python Xinjiang Game Development Torture Rust Employee Monitoring Electronics Cost Cutting Mathematics Racial Profiling Functional Programming Online Safety Bill Programming Language War on Terror Physics Atlassian Embedded Systems CSAM Self Improvement NYPD Database Alameda Research Unix International Students Astronomy TSA Retro Computing Earn It Act Nostalgia Car Features Debugging Bloatware Geeks, nerds, and hackers should find themselves right at home! Interestingly, while the community tends to be visionary and forward-looking (with technical matters at least), it definitely has a soft spot for (technical) nostalgia. While the modern world is amazing, we miss ZX Spectrum, Z80 assembly, and 8086 dearly. At least we find some comfort in PICO-8. On the anger-inducing side, most topics need no explanation. It is worth clarifying though that Hacker News does not hate International Students, but the posts related to them tend to be overwhelmingly negative, reflecting the community’s sympathy for the challenges faced by those studying abroad. Comically, Hacker News is not a community of car lovers. When we talk about cars, it is because there's something wrong with them. For more insights like this, use the tool at the top of the page to explore the diverse landscape of HN topics in detail. Some topics are just divisive Besides topics being unimodally love or hate-inducing, some topics are bimodal: Sometimes a post about the topic generates a highly positive response, other times a flamewar. Examples include GNOME - KDE vs. GNOME - the war has been raging for 25 years. Google - a dominant force in the Internet, both in good and bad. Government regulations - damned if you do and damned if you don't. Venture capital - the lifeblood of Silicon Valley and a source of endless gossip. See more by sorting by the divisive column in the tool above. To rank highly by the divisiveness score, the topic must be associated with both negative and positive posts equally and not many neutral ones. Is the mood improving? Cue Betteridge's Law. We can plot the average sentiment over time, as expressed in daily comment threads: The data proves that things sucked in August 2021 (or maybe it was just the Apple debacle highlighted in the chart above). Overall, there's a clear but modest downward trend in the average sentiment. It would require a deeper analysis to understand why this is the case. Putting aside an obvious hypothesis that life is just getting worse (which might not be true), an alternative hypothesis may be a variant of Eternal September. It takes conscious and tireless effort to maintain a positive mood in a growing community. Kudos to HN moderators for keeping the community thriving and positive over the years! Implementation A reason to be excited and optimistic about the future is the very existence of this article. While natural language processing and sentiment analysis have been around for decades, the quality, versatility, and the ease of use afforded by LLMs is absolutely unprecedented. Attaining the quality of topics and sentiment scores with a messy dataset like the one here would have required a PhD-thesis level of effort just a few years ago - and very likely the results would have been worse. In contrast, we developed all the code for this article in about seven hours. Processing 350M tokens with just a decent-sized model would have required a supercomputer a decade ago, whereas in our case it took about 16 hours using widely available hardware. Most amazingly, all the building blocks, LLMs included, are available in open source! Let's do a quick overview (with code and data), showing how you can repeat the experiment at home. Here's what we did at the high level: Each white box in the picture is a Metaflow flow, linked below: HNSentimentInit creates a list of posts to analyze. HNSentimentCrawl downloads the posts. HNSentimentAnalyzePosts parses the posts and runs them through an LLM. HNSentimentCommentData reconstructs comment threads based on a Hacker News dataset in Google BigQuery. We should/could have used this in the step (1) too. Next time! HNSentimentAnalyzeComments runs the comment threads through an LLM. Data analyses and the charts shown above are produced in notebooks (the gray box in the picture). Here's what the flows do: Donwloading posts First, we wanted to analyze topics covered by Hacker News posts that have generated some discussion. Using a publicly available dataset of HN posts (thanks Julien!), we queried all posts between January 2020 and June 2023 (the latest date available in this dataset) which had at least 20 upvotes and more than five comments, which resulted in about 100,000 posts. Here's the simple Metaflow flow that did the job, much thanks to DuckDB. Since the 100,000 posts are mostly on different domains, we can safely download them in parallel without DDOS'ing the servers. It took only around 25 minutes to download the pages with 100 parallel workers (see here how). Large-scale document understanding with LLMs Parsing the text content from random HTML pages used to be a massive PITA, but BeautifulSoup makes it beautifully straightforward. At this point, we have a relatively clean dataset of about 100,000 text documents with more than 500M tokens in total. Processing the dataset once with a state-of-the-art LLM, say, GPT-4o, or Llama3 70b on AWS Bedrock would cost around $1,300 (using ChatGPT batch API), not counting the output tokens. Besides the cost, time is a concern - we want to process the dataset as fast as possible, so we can evaluate the results quickly, and rinse-and-repeat if needed. Hence we don't want to get rate-limited or otherwise bottlenecked by the APIs. We have posted previously about our success with NVIDIA NIM microservices that provide a quickly growing library of LLMs and other GenAI models as prepackaged images, fully optimized to take advantage of vLLM, TensorRT-LLM and the Triton Inference Server, so you don't have to spend time chasing the latest tricks with LLM inference. Since we had NIMs included in our Outerbounds deployment, we just added @nim to our flow to get access to a high-throughput LLM endpoint that costs only as much as the auto-scaling GPUs it runs on, in this case, four H100 GPUs. Naturally you can hit an LLM endpoint of your choosing - the options are many these days. Prompting an LLM to produce a list of topics for each post Our prompt is straightforward: Assign 10 tags that best describe the following article. Reply only the tags in the following format: 1. first tag 2. second tag N. Nth tag --- [First 5000 tokens from a web page] The llama3 70b model we used has a 8,000 token context window, but we decided to limit the number of tokens to 5,000 to account for differences in the tokenizer behavior, making sure that we don't go past the limit. Processing about 140M inputs tokens in this manner took about 9 hours. We were able to increase throughput to around 4,300 input tokens per second by hitting the model concurrently with five workers, as neatly shown in our UI below, to take advantage of dynamic batching and other optimizations. Processing comments Instead of trying to download 100,000 comment pages directly from Hacker News, we leveraged a Hacker News dataset in Google BigQuery. Annoyingly, comments in the database are not directly associated with their parent post, so we had to implement a small function to reconstruct the comment threads. We can't run the function with BigQuery directly but luckily we can export the data easily in Parquet files. Loading the resulting 16M rows in DuckDB and scanning through them was a breeze, aided by the fact that Metaflow knows how to load data fast. We just added @resources(disk=10000, cpu=8, memory=32000) to run the function on a large enough instance. Prompting an LLM to analyze sentiment With the comment threads at hand, we were able to run them through our LLM with this prompt: In the scale between 0-10 where 0 is the most negative sentiment and 10 is the most positive sentiment, rank the following discussion. Reply in this format: SENTIMENT X where X is the sentiment rating --- [First 3000 tokens from a comment thread] Getting a simple structured output like this seems to work without issues. We processed through some 230M input tokens in this manner, which took only about 7 hours as we needed only two output tokens. Why Metaflow You can reproduce all the steps above using your favorite toolchain. Here are key reasons why we used Metaflow and why you might want to consider it too: Staying organized without effort - a big benefit compared to random Python scripts or notebooks is that Metaflow persists all artifacts automatically, tracks all executions, and keeps everything organized. We relied on Metaflow's namespaces to execute large and expensive runs alongside prototypes, knowing that the two can't interfere with each other. We used Metaflow tags to organize data sharing between flows while they were being developed independently. Easy cloud scaling - crawling required horizontal scaling, DuckDB required vertical scaling, and LLMs required a GPU backend. Metaflow handled all the cases out of the box. Highly available orchestrator - running a large dataset through an LLM can cost thousands of dollars. You don't want the run to fail because of random issues. We relied on a highly available Argo Workflows orchestrator that Metaflow supports out of the box to keep the run running for hours. You can do all of the above using open-source Metaflow, but we had a few additional benefits by running the flows on Outerbounds Platform: It is simply fun to develop code like this, including notebooks, with VSCode running on cloud workstations, scaling to the cloud is smooth sailing, and @nim allowed us to hit LLMs without worrying about cost or rate limiting. If features like this sound relevant to your interests, we are happy to get you started for free. Dive deeper at home There's much more that can be analyzed and visualized with this dataset. Instead of spending a few thousand dollars hitting OpenAI APIs, you can download the topics and sentiments we created: post-sentiment.json contains a mapping post_id -> sentiment_score post-topics.json contains a mapping post_id -> [topics] topics-data.json contains a cleaned and joined dataset based on the above JSONs, powering the tool at the top of this article. You can find metadata related to post IDs in this HuggingFace dataset and in the Google BigQuery Hacker News dataset. To view posts, simply open https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=[post_id]. For instance, it would be interesting to look into the correlation between post domains and sentiments and topics. Our hunch is that certain domains produce predominantly positive sentiments and vice versa. Or, do divisive topics garner more points?

Its like the linux of operating systems. Sure you can handwrite up some custom OS more specialized for a purpose. But its much easier to just use linux, which everyone understands on a basic level and is extremely robust, and modifying it slightly for the end goal. And saying \"Traditional sentiment analysis\" tools are \"Battle tested\" is laughable. LLMs in the past year alone, probably has 1000x the cumulative usage of all sentiment analysis tools in history. LLMs get 100 billion + each year in research, improvements, engineering, optimisations. LLMs keep rapidly improving year to year in capabilities. Sonnet 3.5 already obliterates the original GPT-4 in every aspect. LLMs keep getting cheaper year to year. Gemini flash is like 100x cheaper than the original GPT3.5. You can onboard any person who can write python, to start using LLMs to perform language analysis in a day. Versus weeks to use these traditional tools. Nearly all NLP tasks will be standardised to use LLMs as the baseline default tool. Sure there'll be some short term degradations in some specific aspect, but there's no stopping the tide. By the way, traditional ML-based translation is also pretty much dead and replaced by LLMs. I've been seeing an explosion in fan-translations done by say Sonnet 3.5, the improvement in fluency and accuracy is just radical and extreme, I often don't even notice the AI-translation anymore. reply RamblingCTO 12 hours agorootparentSorry, but not really. If you know what you do, you don't just pick an LLM. LLMs are trained/built for a specific task: text generation. Other models are trained on different tasks. If you know what you do, you compare models (I don't mean LLM models with that!) and choose the best performing. Just because LLMs receive more training doesn't mean they have a better performance. Very weird and flawed way of thinking. This is just hype thinking reply hitradostava 11 hours agorootparentI have to agree with the parent. LLMs are excellent at a large range of NLP tasks. Of course they are not going to replace all ML models, but when it comes to NLP they are clearly better than lots of trained models (e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18025). reply saberience 8 hours agorootparentLLMs are general purpose tools and absolutely are not better than trained models (using the latest techniques) for a specific task. I mean, that's obviously true if you think about it. You can use similar datasets and the latest model architectures and if you train a model purely for sentiment analysis it will be better than frontier general purpose LLMs for sentiment analysis. reply daveguy 15 hours agorootparentprevAside from a half dozen or so zeros, you're right on. reply rsanek 15 hours agorootparenton what, the spending?

Yes, both can write more or less the same program, but you'll get the same result with less effort and more quickly with the modern languages. Yes, modern languages will always be slower and heavier on resources than C. reply anonylizard 16 hours agorootparentThat's inaccurate, because traditional sentiment analysis, or rather the entire NLP ecosystem, is a very niche and underoptimized space. Its not comparing C against Javascript, its comparing Ada against Javascript. Ada is not going to be any faster than javascript because its too niche and therefore underoptimised. The theoretical minimum computation required by LLMs is far higher than traditional simple NLP algorithms. But the practical computation cost of LLMs will soon be cheaper, because LLMs get so much investment and use, there's massive full-stack optimizations all the way from the GPU to the end libraries. reply visarga 12 hours agoprevI did a similar kind of process for my own chat logs. I have about 11M tokens worth of logs, and it took 2 days to crunch all of them with ollama and LLaMA 3.1 8B on my MacBook. It's slow, but free. I generated title, summary, keywords and hierarchical topics up to 3 levels up from the original text. My plan for now is to put them in a vector search engine, which, incidentally, was made with Sonnet 3.5 with very little iteration. I want to play around to see how I can organize my ideas with LLMs, make something useful from all that text. I really don't know what I will discover. One small insight I already found is that summarization works really well, you can use summaries instead of full texts to prime Claude and it works better than expected. Unlimited context? Maybe. Another direction of research is to create a nice taxonomy, there are thousands of topics, pretty difficult task, but there must be a way using clustering and LLMs. That is why I generated topic, parent-topic, gp-topic, and ggp-topic from all snippets. I would probably manually edit the top 2 levels of the taxonomy to give it the right focus. I'm also integrating with my HN and reddit feeds. X is too stingy with the API.

Sentiment measurement is only accurate to the degree that people are expressing their real feelings via tokens. I can imagine various psychological and political reasons for a discrepancy.

The user base has grown significantly. The site has gone from being about hacking (“hey here’s an empty desk”) to the culture of hackers at large (“tech was a mistake when it got invaded by VC hucksters”.) TFA’s sentiment decrease tracks very closely with the huge uptick in user creation that started in 2022. HN isn’t really a tech site anymore, it’s about vibes. That makes sense given that in 2024 there’s a million places online talking about tech so HN only has its culture to distinguish itself. This wasn’t the case in 2008. The vibes here, along with the older demographics of the site, are increasingly nostalgic and cynical.

It doesn't matter if the risk is caused by the person being a bad driver or if the risk is caused by the commute route that you take at a certain time of day. In either case, there's risk that is shown by the data. If you are driving a route that is stressful and risky, it doesn't matter if you're a good driver or a bad driver - you're doing something that is risky. In days of old this was done by looking at the commute distance and likely route (the insurance company has home address and work address). reply vel0city 21 minutes agorootparentprev> the computer doesn't know if you accelerate and brake hard because you're an aggressive driver, or if your circumstances require it Preface: I'm not strongly for these hyper monitoring systems of driving patterns for insurance. Often being in a situation where you have to slam on your brakes means even if you're a good driver you're in a lot more riskier environments than a driver who doesn't often have to. A good driver that is rarely in a situation where he has to slam on his brakes probably gets into fewer collisions than the same driver in an environment where he needs to do it often. Often having to brake hard is still potentially an indicator of higher claim likliehood. reply kube-system 1 hour agorootparentprevAlso, the surveillance is bad because of the inherent breach of privacy. reply itsoktocry 30 minutes agorootparentprev>Firstly, the entire port of insurance is to spread risk.

If the the market for insurance is \"too efficient\" at determining who is high-risk and who is not, then it is no longer fulfilling its social function. Insurance is a business, where the insured pays an insurer to pay for costs for damages that the insured cannot afford to pay. The insurer's job is to calculate the amount of premium necessary to ensure they can afford to pay for the damages, but they also have to sell the insurance at competitive prices, so they probably have to calculate premiums based on the risks that each insured represents. >Secondly, you seem to be implying that only aggressive drivers are getting flagged by the data. But the computer doesn't know if you accelerate and brake hard because you're an aggressive driver, or if your circumstances require it. Maybe you have to commute to your job in heavy stop-and-go traffic with difficult merges. The goal is not to label drivers as aggressive or not aggressive. The goal is to tease out the factors that lead to claims. With a sufficiently large dataset, it should be possible to tease out whether or not characteristics such as stop and go traffic is an indication of higher likelihood of claims. If an insurer does not calculate this property, then a competing insurer probably will and hence be able to offer lower premiums to less risky customers. >Finally, this kind of surveillance changes behavior in ways that may make things less safe. If you're driving down a street and a ball bounces out from behind a parked car do you slam on your brakes out of fear that there is a child chasing after it, or do you think that hitting the brakes might make your premiums go up so you just hope that there isn't a child coming. If a single event of slamming brakes is causing premiums to go up, I doubt that insurer is pricing premiums accurately. However, if the insurer experiences greater losses in neighborhoods where people are slamming their brakes more often, then obviously the risks are higher in that neighborhood and premiums need to reflect that. The higher premiums themselves would tell people in the neighborhood that either they are driving too fast, or they are not looking after the children. And if people are choosing to risk plowing into a child for the sake of their premiums, then that is more of a moral quandary than a problem with insurance pricing.

That might be true for any brand that shoves satellite radio into your vehicle.

    "originBody": "About this project Could there be a better way to program communicating systems? Functional programs are easy to write, but programs that interact with each other and the outside world are much harder. Programming models like the Actor model and the Tuplespace model make great strides toward simplifying programs that communicate. However, a few key difficulties remain. The Syndicated Actor model addresses these difficulties. It is closely related to both Actors and Tuplespaces, but builds on a different underlying primitive: eventually-consistent replication of state among actors. Its design also draws on widely deployed but informal ideas like publish/subscribe messaging. Syndicated Actors Securing syndicated interaction The Syndicated Actor model in context Actors Tuplespaces Publish/Subscribe Conversational Concurrency The purpose of communication is to share state Conversational Concurrency in brief Conversational frames, conversational knowledge Language support: Syndicate DSL Facets represent (sub-)conversations A taste of the Syndicate/js DSL Polyglot and networked programming: Preserves Preserves: a data model with associated syntax Syndicated Actor network protocol Who I am Three big ideas fit together to yield the complete vision: Syndicated Actor Model Integrates Actors with Tuplespace-like shared state, Ambients-like treatment of system boundaries, and Erlang-like techniques for signalling and recovering from partial failure. A special kind of syndicated actor, a dataspace, routes and replicates published data according to actors’ interests. Conversational Concurrency A way of thinking about IPC and networking, going beyond message-passing to include ideas of conversational frame and conversational state. Syndicate Domain-Specific Language Extends programming languages with domain-specific language (DSL) constructs for directly expressing syndicated actor and conversational concepts. A few smaller pieces of the puzzle exist alongside the main ideas: Object capabilities. The only properly compositional way to secure a distributed system. A meaningful data language. For robust communication between programming languages and across network links, we need a data language with a sensible equational theory. Interaction protocols. “Procedure call” is baked-in to our programming languages. What other interaction patterns deserve similar treatment? Integrated networking. After all, IPC is networking and networking is IPC! Anything more remote than “objects in the same sequential thread (actor)” is considered “remote”, and works the same way. Syndicated Actors The Syndicated Actor model is a new model of concurrency, closely related to the actor, tuplespace, and publish/subscribe models. The Syndicated Actor model is, at heart, a mechanism for sharing state among neighboring concurrent components. The design focuses on mechanisms for sharing state because effective mechanisms for communication and coordination follow as special cases. You can think of it as concurrent object-oriented programming with intrinsic publish/subscribe support. It is based around actors which not only exchange messages, but publish (“assert”) selected portions of their internal state (“assertions”) to their peers in a publish/subscribe, reactive manner. A dataspace is a special kind of actor which relays messages and replicates published state from peer to peer. State replication subsumes Erlang-style links and monitors, publish/subscribe, tuplespaces, presence notifications, directory/naming services, and more. Securing syndicated interaction Access control is expressed using a generalization of object capabilities to express control over state replication and observation of replicated state as well as ordinary message-passing and RPC. Long-lived capabilities based on Macaroons allow secure delegation and attenuation of authority. Object capabilities are a natural fit for Actor-style systems (as demonstrated by E and subsequent research and systems based on it), so it makes sense that they would work well for the Syndicated Actor model. The main difference to capabilities for plain Actors is that syndicated capabilities express pattern-matching-based restrictions on the assertions that may be directed toward a given peer, as well as the messages that may be sent its way. The Syndicated Actor model in context See here for more on comparisons of syndicated actors with other programming models. The closest relatives to the Syndicated Actor model are Actors, Tuplespaces, and Pub/Sub:1 Actors In the Actor model2, message passing is fundamental. But what we really want, often, is state synchronization: I want some object over there to know about my state over here; and I want this object here to track the state of that object there. → Actors don’t handle shared state well: programmers are left to encode it via message-passing. Tuplespaces With Tuplespaces, state-passing is fundamental. But the way state moves around a tuplespace system causes problems for both fault-tolerance and eventual consistency. Lots of research on Tuplespaces has explored ways to repair these deficits. → Tuplespaces don’t do messaging at all, and handle shared state in a way that causes problems for fault-tolerance and eventual consistency. Publish/Subscribe Pub/sub systems offer multicast of messages to groups of subscribers. They work well when topic matching rules are simple and with self-contained, ephemeral messages. They work less well for stateful conversations, where joining subscribers must be “brought up to speed” before their real-time stream of messages starts. → Pub/sub systems can struggle with flexibility and with management of state. In short, despite the fact that the same patterns of interconnection, naming, routing and layering keep reappearing in all sorts of software, our programming models and languages don’t do well at letting us express these patterns. Likewise, firewalls, membranes and system boundaries are ubiquitous, but remain unrepresented and implicit in most approaches to concurrency. Bringing these concepts into our programming models and programming languages helps eliminate language patterns, simplifying our programs.3 Conversational Concurrency The purpose of communication is to share state When programs are written with concurrency in mind, the programmer reasons about the interactions between concurrent components or agents in the program. This includes exchange of information, as well as management of resources, handling of partial failure, collective decision-making and so on.4 These components might be objects, or threads, or processes, or actors; or larger units still, such as whole machines or clusters; or even some more nebulous and loosely-defined concept—a group of callbacks, perhaps. The programmer has the notion of an agent in their mind, which translates into some representation of that agent in the program. We think about the contexts (because there can be more than one) in which agents exist in two different ways. From each agent’s perspective, the important thing to think about is the boundary between the agent and everything else in the system. But from the system perspective, we often think about conversations between agents, whether it’s just two having an exchange, or a whole group collaborating on some task. Agents in a conversation play different roles, join and leave the group, and build shared conversational state. Each act of communication contributes to a shared understanding of the relevant knowledge required to undertake some task common to the involved parties. That is, the purpose of communication is to share state: to replicate information from peer to peer. Conversational Concurrency in brief The idea of Conversational Concurrency can be summarised as follows:5 Agents collaborate to achieve some shared task. Each task is delimited by a conversational frame. Within that frame, components share knowledge related to the domain of the task at hand, and knowledge related to the knowledge, beliefs, needs, and interests of the various participants in the collaborative group. Conversations are recursively structured by shared knowledge of (sub-)conversational frames, defined in terms of any or all of the types of knowledge we have discussed. Some conversations take place at different levels within a larger frame, bridging between tasks and their subtasks. Components are frequently engaged in multiple tasks, and thus often participate in multiple conversations at once. The knowledge a component needs to do its job is provided to it when it is created, or later supplied to it in response to its interests. Existing programming languages lack linguistic support for conversational concurrency, leaving the programmer to fend for themselves. The Syndicated Actor model, the idea of dataspaces, and their supporting DSL are a response to this lack. Conversational frames, conversational knowledge The conversational state that accumulates as part of a collaboration among components can be thought of as a collection of facts. First, there are those facts that define the frame of a conversation. These are exactly the facts that identify the task at hand; we label them “framing knowledge”, and taken together, they are the “conversational frame” for the conversation whose purpose is completion of a particular shared task. Just as tasks can be broken down into more finely-focused subtasks, so conversations can be broken down into sub-conversations. Part of the conversational state of an overarching interaction describes a frame for each sub-conversation, within which sub-conversational state exists. The knowledge framing a conversation acts as a bridge between it and its wider context. If domain knowledge is “what is true in the world” for the purposes of a given conversation, and epistemic knowledge is “who knows what”, the third piece of the puzzle is “who needs to know what” in order to effectively make a contribution to the shared task at hand. Knowledge of the various interests in a group allows collaborators to plan their communication acts according to the needs of individual components and the group as a whole. In conversations among people, interests are expressed as questions; in a computational setting, they are conveyed by requests, queries, or subscriptions. The interests of components in a concurrent system thus direct the flow of knowledge within the system. Language support: Syndicate DSL The Syndicated Actor model, taken alone, explains communication and coordination among components but does not offer the programmer any assistance in structuring the internals of components. A handful of Domain-Specific Language (DSL) constructs, together dubbed Syndicate, expose the primitives of the Syndicated Actor model, the features of dataspaces, and the concepts of conversational concurrency to the programmer in an ergonomic way. See the Syndicate DSL documentation for details of the syntax and meaning of the constructs that Syndicate adds to each underlying programming language. The language constructs offered by the Syndicate DSL extend the underlying programming language that is used to write a component. They bridge between the language’s own computational model and the style of interaction offered by the Syndicated Actor model. Each interactive component needs some way of representing the conversations it is engaged in mapping incoming events to these conversations managing the shared understanding that it builds as it works towards the overall program’s goal cleaning up shared state after partial failure of a component scoping interactions and shared state inside the program Facets represent (sub-)conversations To address these requirements, Syndicate represents conversations with a language construct called a facet. Facets are similar to the “nested threads” of Martin Sústrik’s idea of Structured Concurrency (see also Wikipedia). Every actor has at least one (root) facet, and all its facets form a tree. Generally speaking, one facet corresponds to one conversation, framing (in the sense of Conversational Concurrency) its children, which each correspond to some sub-conversation within the frame of their parent. When a parent facet is shut down, all its children are shut down in an orderly fashion, making management of conversational state straightforward. Each facet publishes (“asserts”) relevant pieces of state (“assertions”) to relevant peers. As its internal state changes, its published assertions are re-evaluated, and any changes are automatically propagated to peers. Facets also subscribe to assertions emanating from their peers. They do this in a unique way: by asserting their interest in particular fact(s) to the publishing peer. That is, an expression of interest is itself an assertion that can be seen and reacted to by peers. When a facet terminates, whether normally or as the result of an exception, all the assertions it has published are guaranteed to be withdrawn. Assertions thus subsume Erlang-style monitors/links, “presence” notifications (as seen in, for example, XMPP), and pub/sub mechanisms for optimizing message delivery based on subscriber presence or absence. A taste of the Syndicate/js DSL To give some of the flavour of working with Syndicate DSL constructs, here’s a program written in JavaScript extended with Syndicate constructs: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 function chat(initialNickname, sharedDataspace, stdin) { spawn 'chat-client' { field nickName = initialNickname; at sharedDataspace assert Present(this.nickname); during sharedDataspace asserted Present($who) { on start console.log(`${who} arrived`); on stop console.log(`${who} left`); on sharedDataspace message Says(who, $what) { console.log(`${who}: ${what}`); } } on stdin message Line($text) { if (text.startsWith('/nick ')) { this.nickname = text.slice(6); } else { send sharedDataspace message Says(this.nickname, text); } } } } Polyglot and networked programming: Preserves Interoperation among programming languages and across network links demands a shared data language and a common network protocol. For components to communicate, they need a common vocabulary. When Syndicate is used to organise concurrency within a single program, in a single programming language, that language’s own data structures suffice. But when Syndicate is used to organise larger systems, perhaps written as separate, interoperating programs in many different languages, perhaps communicating via network links (e.g. Bluetooth, Ethernet, or TCP/IP), a common data language is needed. A new data language called Preserves plays the role of common data language in this project, and a network protocol built using Preserves allows expression of syndicated-actor actions and events across network links. Preserves: a data model with associated syntax See the Preserves website for more about Preserves. From the introduction to the Preserves specification document: Preserves supports records with user-defined labels, embedded references, and the usual suite of atomic and compound data types, including binary data as a distinct type from text strings. Its annotations allow separation of data from metadata such as comments, trace information, and provenance information. Preserves departs from many other data languages in defining how to compare two values. Comparison is based on the data model, not on syntax or on data structures of any particular implementation language. Preserves supports schemas for describing the structure and interesting content of Preserves documents. It has multiple syntaxes for different purposes: one is human-readable, and looks a lot like JSON; another is a compact binary format, suitable for canonicalization and hashing. Here are some example Preserves documents, written in Preserves text syntax:A simple record, used in the example chat program above to assert presence of a user within a chat room.Again, a simple record, used as a message indicating that a user said something to be forwarded on to peers in a chat room.#:> A more complex record, representing an asserted interest in other assertions.

    "commentBody": "The Syndicated Actor Model (syndicate-lang.org)115 points by sph 8 hours agohidepastfavorite25 comments sph 7 hours agoI'll attempt a tl;dr of this project: Carl Hewitt's actor model (often seen in Erlang, Akka & co.) uses message-passing to communicate between concurrent actors, but doesn't easily allow for state synchronization or dynamic topologies of actors. Tuple Spaces [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple_space] are another paradigm for distributed communication where message tuples are stored into distributed shared \"space\" and processes can pull messages that match a certain pattern. Very much like how biological cell communicate between each other, which allows for dynamic topologies, but you lose any concept of ordering (message X came before message Y) The Syndicated Actor model is an attempt at bridging the two ideas to dynamically allow neighbouring actors to coordinate and communicate with each other using something like pub/sub. --- The history page is very much worth reading: https://syndicate-lang.org/about/history/ Here's the author's doctoral thesis: https://syndicate-lang.org/papers/conversational-concurrency... And SYNIT, a reactive layer for Linux which aims to replace most user-space subsystems with this model: https://synit.org/book/ reply svieira 4 hours agoparentThe author also directly relates this to Datalog and its descendants, so if you like Peter Alvaro's work this may be worth looking into more > State management via dataspaces is directly comparable to a distributed datalog-based system, and enjoys many of the same benefits. https://syndicate-lang.org/about/syndicate-in-context/ reply pyinstallwoes 5 hours agoparentprevI tried to understand Tuple Space a few times but I don't get it. I understand Erlang and the actor model and how distributed processes work, but what is unique in the Tuple Space aspect? I vaguely recall getting it but it doesn't register for me now. Maybe it's because Erlang already has pub/sub for every 'thing?' reply sph 5 hours agorootparentIn Erlang you have a PID and send messages directly to it. The topology is a directed graph. Process in a tuple space just communicate through shared memory. Messages have no address. And processes can write or pattern match messages from this shared memory space. Process A: put({\"foo\", \"bar\", 123}) put({\"foo\", \"quux\", 456}) Process B, later: get({\"foo\", ?x, 123}) # here x = \"bar\" Imagine a cell communicating with others by squirting out molecules meant for no one in particular, and having external receptors to match specific other molecules. This allows actors that have not been designed to work with each other to communicate, just by sharing the same tuple space. reply layer8 3 hours agorootparentThis sounds like you effectively have a global schema (in the DB sense) that all actors have to be consistent with, causing everything to be coupled with everything. reply chuckadams 2 hours agorootparentThey’re coupled only as far as agreeing on a message format constitutes coupling, which is something you have to do in any actor system anyway. Bigger issue is that tuplespaces tend to be centralized, so it is very much like an app listening to table events in a db, but without a predefined schema. It’s more like pub/sub except one subscribes by message structure, not channel identity. reply layer8 2 hours agorootparentYou also have to prevent unrelated actors from choosing overlapping (conflicting) message formats. In other words, you can’t decide on a new message format without knowledge of all already existing message formats. reply convolvatron 1 hour agorootparentor you can just use namespaces reply layer8 1 hour agorootparentThis would seem to counter “This allows actors that have not been designed to work with each other to communicate, just by sharing the same tuple space.” Alternatively, I don’t see the big difference to just using separate message queues with pattern-based retrieval. In the end, you always have to design who communicates with who in which format. reply pyinstallwoes 4 hours agorootparentprevSo like an implicit global mnesia accessed by \"tuples\" / some identity? reply davexunit 2 hours agoprevInteresting! I don't think I quite understand how this compares to the vat model of actors that was used in E and what tuplespaces are contributing here. I guess I'd just need to sit down and try using the language. See also Goblins, an actor model + object capability system inspired by a lot of the same stuff (like E) that uses the Preserves-derived Syrup format for encoding messages over the network. https://spritely.institute/goblins/ There's also a standard in development for communicating capabilities over the network called OCapN: https://ocapn.org/ reply discreteevent 14 minutes agoprevPossibly similar (but I don't understand the Syndicated Actor Model well enough yet to be sure): Data Distribution Service (DDS) https://www.dds-foundation.org/what-is-dds-3/ reply photonthug 6 hours agoprev> Ambients-like treatment of system boundaries Probably more in the thesis, but at a glance this mention isn't further defined or referenced. The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_calculus is quite beautiful and IMHO doesn't get the attention it deserves. Undergrad as far as I know never covers it, and most people I meet have never heard of it. AFAIK tuplespaces also are not usually taught, and people that have heard of it tend to dismiss it as \"just some obsolete old java thing\" because the most popular implementation probably does fit in that category. A shame since this is really cool stuff. One problem that I see with all 3 technologies (ambients, tuplespaces, and syndicate) is that they sit somewhere at the intersection of datastructures / infrastructure / frameworks, but don't have clear and obvious deployment options. Compare this with say, akka on kubernetes. No matter how cool your tech is, this is an immediate non-starter for everything except academic investigation or low-level systems programming. Synit for user-space sounds neat, but if syndicate is generally a better model than Akka and additionally productionizing the other great ideas of past concurrency research, then it would be awesome to see the gap for other use-cases addressed. reply sph 4 hours agoparentAmbients seem indeed cool and this is where I first heard about them. > One problem that I see with all 3 technologies (ambients, tuplespaces, and syndicate) is that they sit somewhere at the intersection of datastructures / infrastructure / frameworks, but don't have clear and obvious deployment options. I disagree. I think it's simply still science fiction and the cutting edge of distributed research which isn't very popular in academia these days. Actors (1978) are just now barely becoming mainstream with the hype of Elixir and rediscovery of Erlang, even though the world still runs on multithreaded C and dead locks. The tech is cool, but no one is being paid just yet to create practical languages and environments out of this. As in many other scientific endeavours, mainstream programming paradigms tend to lag 20 or 30 years compared to the research. reply butterisgood 3 hours agoprevThis sounds like a modern Linda which is itself a coordination language between parallel actors reduced down to a very simplified model of pattern matching and \"pub/sub\". This kind of parallel programming fell out of favor with PVM and MPI kind of taking over the space in the late 90s, but I suspect Tuplespaces were just a bit ahead of their time. Things like this can potentially really help with the observability of distributed systems, which has been a huge pain especially in areas of eventual consistency. reply kayo_20211030 3 hours agoparentAgree. I thought the concept of tuplespaces was super interesting and, unfortunately and definitely, ahead of its time. IBM had some decent papers on it. reply convolvatron 1 hour agoparentprevI see eventual consistency here as a bit of copout. it really does limit the applicability of the approach by making really not obvious when things are starting to decohere. Someone else mentioned Alvaro in this thread, and I think thats a really fruitful body of work to look for answers that don't require a strong central serialization agent. Monotonicity, vector clocks, multi-panos style domain partitioning, these are partial answers for making this kind of thing be a foundation you can reason about and still scale. reply klabb3 6 hours agoprevI'm very interested in concurrency and new paradigms from a pragmatic perspective. Maybe it's because I'm practically minded, but I don't have the energy to parse this type of content (and that's ok, not blaming anyone). That said, I really, really appreciate when I can see a tangible piece of code that solves a real problem. In the case of concurrency, perhaps a hello world from an actor, ping pong, a chat room, cancellation, timeout or similar. Show something that's easy to do in this model, which is tedious to do in different models. (This shouldn't be hard to find, since concurrency is ridiculously easy to get wrong in most languages). If a partial goal is to engage practicians, then code samples is very effective. I usually don't need the full theory to grok code even in a foreign paradigm. If I can get an initial sense and I like it, then I am infinitely more willing to read up on the theory. Now, unfortunately, you're missing out on one very curious, albeit lazy, reader. For the record, the closest I could find was some pseudo-code[1]. If there's more please share!

I wish there were more! reply sph 5 hours agoparent> I'm very interested in concurrency and new paradigms from a pragmatic perspective. Tell me about it. I also lack formal education, and a lot of advanced research into distributed communication models is basically expressed in alien languages to me, i.e. pi-calculus, rho-calculus, even Hewitt's research. It is both fun and a bit frustrating trying to figure out how they would work in practice from formal academic papers. This one has a lot of actual Racket code though, you might want to read the history section for some practical examples. reply metadaemon 4 hours agoparentprevI clicked around on Tony's site and found this listing of Syndicate related repositories: https://syndicate-lang.org/code/repos/ reply giancarlostoro 5 hours agoprevI think my favorite Actor framework is Microsoft's Orleans, which uses a \"Virtual Actor\" model. It is mainly implemented in C#, and EA implemented their own version in Java then Kotlin called Orbit, but it feels very straight forward for what it does, it was also used extensively to scale the Halo online servers. Decent articles on Orleans and Virtual Actor model. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/orleans/overview https://darlean.io/the-virtual-actor-model/ Discussion on Orbit by EA: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31192795 This basically makes C# behave Erlang esque. You can have a single server running until load kicks off, and even if you destroy a node, spinning it up again is easy. Nodes maintain their own state and can be across systems as needed. You can also do zero-downtime updating like in Erlang. It's really neat. I assume Syndicated Actor Model solves a similar problem, but it looks like they make use of an MQ as needed. What's funny about Orbit though is the Akka devs wrote some sort of \"hit\" piece about why their model is fine, and you don't need Virtual Actors. reply bob1029 2 hours agoparentI like the constraints these models impose for some applications, but I don't see them as fundamentally revolutionizing the application development space. You are still ultimately responsible for persisting every last byte of state that these virtual actors embody. Much of this looks like \"How to Draw an Owl\" [0] to me. You could tie your own hands in approximately same way in a typical monolithic codebase by spinning out some Actor/Grain base types and enforcing a similar execution model around their implementations.

You can take loans out in their name or call some service to do a password reset (since you have all the info to verify you are them) or whatever else.
