At $0.14M/$0.28M it's a no brainier to use their APIs. I understand some people would have privacy concerns and would want to avoid their APIs, although I personally spend all my time contributing to publicly available OSS code bases so I'm happy for any OSS LLM to use any of our code bases to improve their LLM and hopefully also improving the generated code for anyone using our libraries. Since many LLM orgs are looking to build proprietary moats around their LLMs to maintain their artificially high prices, I'll personally make an effort to use the best OSS LLMs available first (i.e. from DeepSeek, Meta, Qwen or Mistral AI) since they're bringing down the cost of LLMs and aiming to render the technology a commodity.

In terms of the personal data you share when using their models, I can't see why they would be any more or less nefarious than big Western tech companies. That said, if you're using a model based in China then by providing them with data and feedback you are in a very small way helping researchers in China catch up with/keep up with/overtake researchers in the West. Maybe in the long term that could end badly. And if you are concerned about the environment, it's entirely possible their training and inference is run using coal power stations. reply rfoo 8 hours agorootparentprev> There’s no company info on DeepSeek’s website.

I wonder what's the reason. reply suprjami 8 hours agoparentBecause code either works or it doesn't. Nobody is replacing our entire income stream with an LLM. You also need a knowledge of code to instruct an LLM to generate decent code, and even then it's not always perfect. Meanwhile plenty of people are using free/cheap image generation and going \"good enough\". Now they don't need to pay a graphic artist or a stock photo licence Any layperson can describe what they want a picture to look like so the barrier to entry and successful exit is a lot lower for LLM image generation than for LLM code generation. reply tcdent 1 hour agoparentprevIt's just gatekeeping. Artists put a ton of time into education and refining their vision inside the craft. Amateur efforts to produce compelling work always look amateur. With augmentation, suddenly the \"real\" artists aren't as differentiated. The whole conversation is obviously extremely skewed toward digital art, and the ones talking about it most visibly are the digital artists. No abstract painter thinks AI is coming for their occupation or cares wether it is easier to create anime dreamscapes this year or the next. reply aithrowaway1987 3 hours agoparentprevLook at who the tools are marketed towards. Writing software involves a lot of tedium, eye strain, and frustration, even for experts who have put in a lot of hours practicing, so LLMs are marketed to help developers make their jobs easier. This is not the case for art or music generators: they are marketed towards (and created by) laypeople with who want generic content and don't care about human artists. These systems are a significant burden on productivity (and fatal burden on creativity) if you are an honest illustrator or musician. Another perspective: a lot of the most useful LLM codegen is not asking the LLM to solve a tricky problem, but rather to translate and refine a somewhat loose English-language solution into a more precise JavaScript solution (or whatever), including a large bag of memorized tricks around sorting, regexes, etc. It is more \"science than art,\" and for a sufficiently precise English prompt there is even a plausible set of optimal solutions. The LLM does not have to \"understand\" the prompt or rely on plagiarism to give a good answer. (Although GPT-3.5 was a horrific F# plagiarist... I don't like LLM codegen but it is far more defensible than music generation) This is not the case with art or music generators: it makes no sense to describe them as \"English to song\" translators, and the only \"optimal\" solutions are the plagiarized / interpolated stuff the human raters most preferred. They clearly don't understand what they are drawing, nor do they understand what melodies are. Their output is either depressing content slop or suspiciously familiar. And their creators have filled the tech community with insultingly stupid propaganda like \"they learn art just like human artists do.\" No wonder artists are mad! reply rahimnathwani 2 hours agorootparentWhat you say may be true about the simplest workflow: enter a prompt and get one or more finished images. But many people use diffusion models in a much more interactive way, doing much more of the editing by hand. The simplest case is to erase part of a generated image, and prompt to infill. But there are people who spend hours to get a single image where they want it. reply rty32 8 hours agoparentprevCoding Assistants are not good enough (yet). Inline suggestions and chats are incredibly helpful and boost productivity (and only to those who know to use them well), but that's as fast as they go today. If they can take a Jira ticket, debug the code, create a patch for a large codebase and understand and respect all the workarounds in a legacy codebase, I would have a problem with it. reply viraptor 7 hours agorootparentHave you seen https://www.swebench.com/ ? Once you engage agentic behaviour, it can take you way further than just the chats. We're already in the \"resolving JIRA tickets\" area - it's just hard to setup, not very well known, and may be expensive. reply IshKebab 3 minutes agorootparent> We're already in the \"resolving JIRA tickets\" area For very simple tasks maybe, but not for the kinds of things I get paid to do. I don't think it will be able to get to the level of reliably doing difficult programming tasks that require understanding and inferring requirements without having AGI, in which case society has other things to worry about than programmers losing their jobs. reply rty32 7 hours agorootparentprevLooks like the definition of \"resolving a ticket\" here is \"come up with a patch that ensures all tests pass\", which does not necessarily include \"add a new test\", \"make sure the patch is actually doing something meaningful\", \"communicate how this is fixed\". Based on my experience and what I saw in the reports in the logs, a solution could be just hallucinating completely useless code -- as long as it doesn't fail a test. Of course, it is still impressive, and definitely would help with the small bugs that require small fixes, especially for open source projects that have thousands of open issues. But is it going to make a big difference? Probably not yet. Also, good luck doing that on our poorly written, poorly documented and under tested codebase. By any standard django is a much better codebase than the one I work on every day. reply viraptor 7 hours agorootparentSome are happy with creating tests as well, but you probably want to mostly write them yourself. I mean, only you know the real world context - if the ticket didn't explain it well enough, LLMs can't do magic. Actually the poorly documented and poorly written is not a huge issue in my experience. The under tested is way more important if you want to automate that work. reply mrklol 8 hours agorootparentprevBut that’s not that far. Like sure, currently it’s not. But \"reading a ticket with a description, find the relevant code, understand the code (often better than human), test it, return the result\" is totally doable with some more iterations. It’s already doable for smaller projects, see GitHub workspaces etc. reply xvector 8 hours agorootparentprevExcept they can't do the equivalent for art yet either, and I am fairly familiar with the state of image diffusion today. I've commissioned tens of thousands of dollars in art, and spent many hundreds of hours working with Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and Flux. What all the generators are missing is intentionality in art. They can generate something that looks great at surface level, but doesn't make sense when you look at the details. Why is a particular character wearing a certain bracelet? Why do the windows on that cottage look a certain way? What does a certain engraving mean? Which direction is a character looking, and why? The diffusers do not understand what they are generating, so they just generates what \"looks right.\" Often this results in art that looks pretty but has no deeper logic, world building, meaning, etc. And of course, image generators cannot handle the client-artist relationship as well (even LLMs cannot), because it requires an understanding of what the customer wants and what emotion they want to convey with the piece they're commissioning. So - I rely on artists for art I care about (art I will hang on my walls), and image generators for throwaway work (such as weekly D&D campaign images.) reply rty32 7 hours agorootparentOf course the \"art\" art -- the part that is all about human creativity -- will always be there. But lots of people in the art business aren't doing that. If you didn't have midjourney etc, what would you be doing for the throwaway work? Learn to design the stuff yourself, hire someone to do it on Upwork, or just not do it all? Some money likely will exchange hands there. reply xvector 7 hours agorootparentThe throwaway work is worth pennies per piece to me at most. So I probably wouldn't do it at all if it wasn't for the generators. And even when it comes to the generators, I typically just use the free options like open-source diffusion models, as opposed to something paid like Midjourney. reply crimsoneer 5 hours agoparentprevI mean, it's supply and demand right. - There is a big demand for really complex software development, and an LLM can't do that alone. So software devs have to do lots of busywork, and like the opportunity to be augmented by AI - Conversely, there is a huge demand for not very high level art. - eg, lots of people want a custom logo or a little jingle, but no many people want to hire a concert pianist or comission the next Salvadore Dali. So most artists spend a lot of time doing a lot of low level work to pay the bills, while software devs spend a lot of time doing low level code monkey work so they can get to the creative part of their job. reply viraptor 8 hours agoparentprevIs it really? I know people who love using LLMs, people who are allergic to the idea of even taking about AI usability and lots of others in between. Same with artists hating the idea, artists who spend hours crafting very specific things with SD, and many in between. I'm not sure I can really point out a big difference here. Maybe the artists are more skewed towards not liking AI since they work with medium that's not digital in the first place, but the range of responses really feels close. reply theshrike79 12 hours agoprev> Continue pretrained on 2.4 Trillion high-quality tokens over 52 major programming languages.

If I were to guess I'd say 80% is in the latter for the larger capable models. Even very small models (like in Karpathy's famous RNN blog) will get syntax right but that is superficial knowledge. reply sitkack 5 hours agoparentprevThe models benefit immensely from being trained with more data from other languages, even if you only ever use it in one. You could finetune it on your codebases and specific docs for added perf. reply rty32 5 hours agoparentprevI don't know if that will happen, but there are tools that at least try to improve performance for specific languages, especially \"underrepresented\" languages, e.g. https://sourcegraph.com/blog/enhancing-code-completion-for-r... reply mark_l_watson 6 hours agoparentprevI get your point.

I experimented with Cursor last weekend, and it was nice for Python, not so great for Common Lisp. reply richardw 11 hours agoparentprevI’d be interested to know if that trade off ends up better. There’s probably a lot of useful training that transfers well between languages, so I wouldn’t be that surprised if the extra tokens helped across all languages. I would guess a top quality single language model would need to be very well supported, eg Python or JavaScript. Not, say, Clojure. reply karagenit 9 hours agoparentprevYep, been waiting for the same thing.

For practical reasons, I often like to know how much GPU RAM is required to run these models locally. The actual number of weights seems to only express some kind of relative power, which I doubt is relevant to most users. Edit: reformulated to sound like a genuine question instead of a complaint. reply magnat 1 hour agoparentBecause you can quantize a model e.g. from original 16 bits down to 5 bits per weight to fit your available memory constraints. reply tarruda 1 hour agoparentprevSince most LLMs are released as FP16, just the number of parameters is enough to know the total required GPU RAM. reply GaggiX 1 hour agoparentprevThe weight size depends on the accuracy you are running the model at, you usually do not run a model at fp16 as it would be wasteful. reply mtrovo 9 hours agoprevI'm new to this whole area and feeling a bit lost.

LLMs this, LLMs that. Am I really missing out something from these muted models? Back when it was released, they were so much capable but now everything is muted to the point they are mostly autocomplete on steroids. How can adding analytics to a system that is designed to act like humans produce any good? What is the goal here? Could you clarify why would some need to analyze LLMs out of all the things? > Rich text data makes LLM traces unique, so we let you track “semantic metrics” (like what your AI agent is actually saying) and connect those metrics to where they happen in the trace But why does it matter? Because at the current state these are muted LLMs overseen by the big company. We have very little to control the behavior and whatever we give it, it will mostly be 'politically' correct. > One thing missing from all LLM observability platforms right now is an adequate search over traces. Again, why do we need to evaluate LLMs? Unless you are working in a security, I see no purpose because these models aren't as capable as they used to be. Everything is muted. For context: I don't even need to prompt engineer these days because it just gives similar result by using the default prompt. My prompts these are literally three words because it gets more of the job done that way than giving elaborate prompt with precise example and context. reply thelittleone 3 hours agoparentI found a LOT more value with personal python based API tools once I employed well described JSON schemas. One of my clients must comply with a cyber risk framework with ~350 security requirements, many of which are so poorly written that misinterpretation is both common and costly. But there are other, more well-written and described frameworks that include \"mappings\" between the two frameworks. In the past I would take one of the vague security requirements, read the mapping to the well described framework to understand the underlying risk, the intent of the question, as well as likely mitigating measures (security controls). On average, that would take between 45-60 minutes per question. Multiply that out it's ~350 * 45 minutes or around 262 hours. My first attempts to use AI for this yielded results that had some value, but lacked the quality to provide to the client. On this past weekend, using python, Sonnet 3.5, JSON schemas, I managed to get the entire ~350 questions documented with a quality level exceeding what I could achieve manually. It cost $10 in API credits and approx 14 hrs of my time (I'm sure a pro could easily achieve this in under 1 hour). The code itself was easy enough, but the big improvements came from the schema descriptions. That was the change that gave me the 'aha' moment. I read over final results for dangerous errors (but ended up changing nothing at all) but just in case, I ran the results through GPT-4o which also found no issues that would prevent sending it to the client. I would never get that job done manually, it's simply too much of a grind for a human to do cheaply or reliably. reply otabdeveloper4 12 hours agoparentprevThey're not \"muted\". You just got used to them and figured out that they don't actually generete knew knowledge or information, they only give a statistically average summary of the top Google query. (I.e., they are super bland, boring and predictable.) reply sswatson 7 hours agorootparentLLMs are pretty bland but they don’t just summarize the top Google result. They can generate correct SQL queries to answer complex questions about novel datasets. Summarizing a search engine result does not get you anywhere close to that. It may be fair to characterize what they’re doing as interpolative retrieval, but there’s no reason to deny that the “interpolative” part pulls a lot of weight. P.S. Yes, reliability is a major problem for many potential LLM applications, but that is immaterial to the question of whether they're doing something qualitatively different from point lookups followed by summarization. reply otabdeveloper4 5 hours agorootparent> They can generate correct SQL queries to answer complex questions about novel datasets. \"Correct\" is a big overstatement, unless by \"SQL\" you mean something extremely basic and ubiquitous. reply coderaptor 5 hours agorootparentThe output can be explicitly constrained to a formal syntax (see outlines.dev). For many cases this is more than enough to solve some hard problems well enough. reply cruffle_duffle 4 hours agorootparentprevHonestly I think the reason it is “extremely basic” is because while it has been trained on “the entire internet” it doesn’t know anything about your specific database schema beyond what you provided in your prompts. If these LLMs were cheap and easy to train (or is it fine tune?) using your own schema and code base on top of its existing “whole internet” training data… it could almost certainly do more than just provide “basic stuff”. Of course I think the training for your own personal stuff would need to be “different” somehow so it knows that while most of its training is generalistic the stuff you feed it is special and it needs to apply the generalist training as a means for understanding your personal stuff. Or something like that. Whatever the case is it would need to be cheap, quick and easy to pick up a generalist LLM and supplement it with the entirety of your own personal corpus. reply baq 8 hours agoparentprev> Everything is LLMs these days. LLMs this, LLMs that. Am I really missing out something from these muted models? Back when it was released, they were so much capable but now everything is muted to the point they are mostly autocomplete on steroids. it was my experience, too, then I tried out that cursor thing and turns out a well designed UX around claude 3.5 is the bees knees. it really does work, highly recommend the free trial. YMMV of course depending on what you work on; I tested it strictly on Python. reply not_a_dane 8 hours agorootparentLLMs and python don't sound good together. reply skull8888888 12 hours agoparentprevHey there, apologies for the late reply. > Could you clarify why would some need to analyze LLMs out of all the things? When you want to understand trends of the output of your Agent / RAG on scale, without looking manually at each trace, you need to another LLM to process the output. For instance, you want to understand what is the most common topic discussed with your agent. You can prompt another LLM to extract this info, Laminar will host everything, and turn this data into metrics. > Why do we need to evaluate LLMs? You right, devs who want to evaluate output of the LLM apps, truly care about the quality or some other metric. For this kind of cases evals are invaluable. Good example would be, AI drive-through agents or AI voice agents for mortgages (use cases we've seen on Laminar) reply Oras 11 hours agorootparentTopic modelling and classifications are real problems in LLM observability and evaluation, glad to see a platform doing this. I see that you have chained prompts, does that mean I can define agents and functions inside the platform without having it in the code? reply skull8888888 11 hours agorootparentYes! Our pipeline builder is pretty versatile. You can define conditional routing, parallel branches, and cycles. Right now we support LLM node and util nodes (json extractor). If you can defined your logic purely from those nodes (and in majority of cases you will be), then great, you can host everything on Laminar! You follow this guide (https://docs.lmnr.ai/tutorials/control-flow-with-LLM) it's bit outdated by gives you a good idea on how to create and run pipelines. reply phillipcarter 5 hours agoparentprevYou're thinking about consumer use cases. Commercial uses cases are not \"muted\" by any means. The goal is to produce domain-specific JSON when fed some contextual data. And LLMs have only gotten better at doing so over time. reply e-clinton 5 hours agoprevWhy are SaaS products all going into a pricing model that’s $0, $50, Custom. What about a $5 or $10 plan… or maybe a sliding scale that you pay for what you use? reply skull8888888 1 hour agoparentHey there, we priced it that way because of our very generous free tier. Your suggestion of usage based pricing also makes sense. So, in our case it might be something: if you pass 50k spans, then you pay something like $0.001 (not a final number) per span. Would you image something like this? reply 7thpower 16 hours agoprevI’m always game for an LLM observability platform that is potentially affordable, at least during the early phases of development. I was using DD at work and found it to be incredibly helpful but now that I am on my own, I am much more price sensitive. Still, having a low friction way to see how things are running, check inputs/outputs is a game changer. One challenge I have run into is a lack of support for Anthropic models. The platforms that do have support are missing key pieces of info like the system prompt. (Prob a skill issue on my end). Also they seem to all be tightly coupled to langchain, etc which is a no-go. Will check this out over the next week or two. Very exciting! reply skull8888888 16 hours agoparentTotally agree, observability is a must for LLM apps. We wanted to build something of extremely high quality but to be affordable for solo devs, that's why open-source and why very generous free tier on our managed version. Regarding Anthropic instrumentation, we support it out of the box! You don't even need to wrap anything, just do laminar initialize and you should see detailed traces. We also support images! Hit me up at robert@lmnr.ai if you need help onboarding or setting up local version reply gitroom 14 hours agoprevHow will you distinguish Laminar as \"the Supabase for LLMOps\" from the many LLM observability platforms already claiming similar aims? Is the integration of text analytics into execution traces your secret sauce? Or, could this perceived advantage just add complexity for developers who like their systems simple and their setups minimal? reply skull8888888 13 hours agoparentHey there! Good question. Our main distinguishing features are: * Ingestion of Otel traces * Semantic events-based analytics * Semantically searchable traces * High performance, reliability and efficiency out of the box, thanks to our stack * High quality FE which is fully open-source * LLM Pipeline manager, first of it's kind, highly customizable and optimized for performance * Ability to track progression of locally run evals, combining full flexibility of running code locally without need to manage data infra * Very generous free tier plan. Our infra is so efficient, that we can accommodate large number of free tier users without scaling it too much. And many more to come in the coming weeks! On of our biggest next priorities is to focus on high quality docs. All of these features can be used as standalone products, similar to Supabase. So, devs who prefer keep things lightweight might just use our tracing solution and be very happy with it. reply viraptor 16 hours agoprev> One thing missing from all LLM observability platforms right now is an adequate search over traces. Why did you decide to build a whole platform and include this feature on top, rather than adding search to (for example) Grafana Tempo? reply skull8888888 15 hours agoparentValid point. For us searchable and especially semantically searchable, traces / spans really make sense only in the context of tracing LLM apps. And then, we view it as a powerful feature, but, primarily in the context of AI/LLM-native observability platform. For us, the ultimate goal is to build the comprehensive platform, with features which are extremely useful for observability and development of LLM/GenAI apps. reply carlmr 12 hours agorootparent>For us searchable and especially semantically searchable, traces / spans really make sense only in the context of tracing LLM apps. I know LLM is the new shiny thing right now. Why is semantic search of traces only useful for LLMs? I've been working in CI/CD and at a large enough scale, searchability of logs was always an issue. Especially as many tools produce a lot of output with warnings and errors that mislead you. Is the search feature only working in an LLM context? If so why? reply skull8888888 12 hours agorootparentNow that you mentioned it, > warnings and errors that mislead you it really makes sense. I guess what I was pointing into, is that when you have really rich text (in your case it would be error descriptions), searching over them semantically is a must have feature. But you are right, being an output of LLM is not a requirement. reply phillipcarter 2 hours agorootparentI think you might find that gets prohibitively expensive at scale. There's various definitions of \"semantic\", such as building indexes on OTel semantic conventions, all the way over to true semantic search over data in attributes. I'd be curious how you're thinking about this at the scale of several millions of traces per second. reply benreesman 16 hours agoprevTo my eye this looks quite a bit more serious and useful than the naive buzzword bingo test would suggest. I really like the stack these folks have chosen. reply skull8888888 15 hours agoparentThank you! We thought a lot about what would make a great title but couldn't really find anything else which would convey info as densely as current title. We also love our current stack :).

    "originBody": "Trickster Dev About RSS tags code Posts Lesser known parts of Python standard library In this article we will explore some lesser known, but interesting and useful corners of Python standard library. Python dictionaries and lists are bread and butter for many applications, but might be too simple for more advanced data organisation. To provide more powerful containers for storing data in memory Python ships a collection module with things like: Deque - list-like data structure for efficient insertion and removal of items from either end. Counter - subclass of dictionary to count stuff. ChainMap - meta-dictionary that provides unified key-value mapping across multiple dictionaries without copying the data. Advanced structures for data mappings: OrderedDict - dictionary that maintains order of key-value pairs (e.g. when HTTP header value matters for dealing with certain security mechanisms). namedtuple - a factory function that creates a subclass of tuple with named fields. Could be convenient for more OOP approach than just using dict. defaultdict - dictionary with some or all or the values pre-filled. Could be handy when you want to provide values for fields that may be missing in web pages being scraped. UserDict, UserList and UserString - wrappers for dict, list and str for further subclassing. API reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html Python has with keyword to create context manager that will auto-cleanup things within lexical scope. For example, you don’t have to worry about closing a file yourself if you open it like this: with open(\"results.txt\", \"w\") as out_f: out_f.write(\"...\") ... contextlib module provide helpers to work with context managers in your code. For example, you can use @contextmanager annotation to turn your own function into one that could be used via with syntax. API reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html Due to technical reality of how floating point number are represented, floating point computations can have some weird results: >>> 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3 5.551115123125783e-17 >>> 1.2 + 2.2 3.4000000000000004 This is mathematically incorrect and a deal breaker for some applications, such as those dealing with money. To address this problem, Python ships decimal module that allows us represent decimal numbers as Python objects with operator overloading. Computations are adjusted so that we get we get the correct result (within a configurable level of precision): >>> from decimal import * >>> one_point_two = Decimal('1.2') >>> one_point_two Decimal('1.2') >>> two_point_two = Decimal('2.2') >>> two_point_two Decimal('2.2') >>> one_point_two + two_point_two Decimal('3.4') API reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html Likewise, we can run into problem when dealing with fractions - one third is not exactly equal to 0.333… Python ships with fractions module to represent them as Python objects with operator overloading: >>> import fractions >>> one_third = fractions.Fraction(numerator=1, denominator=3) >>> 2 * one_third Fraction(2, 3) API reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html Python interpreter is implemented as stack machine internally. When you run some Python code it is compiled to Python-specific bytecode that Python VM executes. For debugging or performance optimisation purposes it might be desirable to disassemble Python bytecode into instruction. The standard Python installation ships with dis module that takes Python code units (e.g. a function) and disassembles the code into a kind of pseudo-assembler: >>> import dis >>> def add(a, b): ... return a+b ... >>> dis.dis(add) 1 0 RESUME 0 2 2 LOAD_FAST 0 (a) 4 LOAD_FAST 1 (b) 6 BINARY_OP 0 (+) 10 RETURN_VALUE API reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html Python statistics module provides a small toolkit of statistical algorithms for relatively simple applications where it is an overkill to use Pandas or Numpy: standard deviation, several kinds of average of numeric data, linear regression, correlation, normal distribution and others. For people eager to join the AI/ML revolution it provides Naive Bayes classifier - an algorithm that can be considered a minimum viable example of machine learning. API reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html You may sometimes want to open web browser from your Python code. Since Python is portable and multiplatform language this may be bit of hassle due to differences between platforms and setups. To make this easier Python ships a webbrowser module with simple API to make a browser show a page. For example, we can call open_new() function with URL: >>> import webbrowser >>> webbrowser.open_new('https://trickster.dev') True If you want to open a local file (e.g. HTML report with results of some automation) you need to pass a file URL to one of the functions: >>> import os >>> file_url = 'file://' + os.path.realpath('test.html') >>> webbrowser.open(file_url) True API reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html Distributing Python programs in source code form can be problematic if there’s some non-technical users at the receiving end. Even if they have Python installed there can be lacking dependencies, version conflicts and other runtime issues. To make this less terrible Python ships zipapp module with CLI tool and Python API to package Python code into single file packages. This provides an interesting midpoint between using virtual environments and solutions like PyInstaller to compile the app into platform-specific form - code remains portable, but Python interpreter has to be there to run it.

The developer ergonomics just don’t seem right. These days I use attrs and cattrs, and I’m much happier. Everything feels a lot more straightforward. attrs is what Python’s dataclasses were based on, but they kept on improving it, so attrs just feels like standard Python with a little bit extra. reply BerislavLopac 12 hours agoparentprevChainMap might be the most underrated bit in the standard library. reply stevesimmons 5 hours agorootparentFor anyone wanting some more explanation, ChainMap can be used to build nested namespaces from a series of dicts without having to explicitly merge the names in each level. Updates to the whole ChainMap go into the top-level dict. The docs are here [0]. Some simple motivating applications: - Look up names in Python locals before globals before built-in functions: `pylookup = ChainMap(locals(), globals(), vars(builtins))` - Get config variables from various sources in priority order: `var_map = ChainMap(command_line_args, os.environ, defaults)` - Simulate layered filesystems - etc [0] https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collectio... reply padthai 15 hours agoparentprevWhy do you use OrderedDict for now that regular dicts are ordered by default? reply Flimm 6 hours agorootparentTwo dictionaries with equal keys and values are considered equal in Python, even if the order of the entries differ. By contrast, two OrderedDict objects are only equal if their respective entries are equal and if their order does not differ. reply heavyset_go 15 hours agorootparentprevOrderedDicts have some convenience methods and features that ordinary dicts don't have. reply wodenokoto 14 hours agorootparentDo you have any examples? reply heavyset_go 13 hours agorootparentCheck out the docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collectio... reply rbanffy 15 hours agorootparentprevAlso, dicts can become unordered at any time in the future. Right now the OrderedDict implementation is a thin layer over dict, but there are no guarantees it’ll always be that. reply 3eb7988a1663 14 hours agorootparentNot true as of 3.7[0] the insertion-order preservation nature of dict objects has been declared to be an official part of the Python language spec.

Thanks for the correction. reply SuchAnonMuchWow 10 hours agorootparentprevdict are ordered to keep argument order when using named arguments in function calling. So it would be a non-trivial breaking change to revert this now. I would argue that OrderedDict have more chances to be depreciated than dict becoming unordered again, since there is now little value to keep OrderedDict around now (and the methods currently specific to UnorderedDict could be added to dict). reply wodenokoto 14 hours agorootparentprevThey can, but ordered dict can also become unordered in the future, should the steering committee decide. But seriously: It’s no longer an implementation detail that dictionaries are ordered in Python. It’s a specification of how Python works. reply rbanffy 1 hour agorootparentI missed that in the 3.7 release notes. reply judicious 14 hours agorootparentprevThere in lies another reason why OrderedDicts are still useful even in 3.12 reply rbanffy 1 hour agorootparentNot really. It was pointed out that since 3.7 the order preserving behaviour is part of the spec for dicts. reply judicious 37 minutes agorootparentI guess for most purposes, OrderedDicts are then obsolete, but I believe there are some extra convenience methods that they have, but I've only really needed to preserve order. Makes you think what other parts of Python have become obsolete. reply d0mine 12 hours agorootparentprevIt may be more explicit: OrderedDict has move_to_end() which may be useful e.g., for implementing lru_cache-like functionality (like deque.rotate but with arbitrary keys). reply masklinn 9 hours agorootparentOTOH that’s a lot less useful now that functools.lru_cache exists: it’s more specialised so it’s lighter, more efficient, and thread-safe. So unless you have extended flexibility requirements around your LRU, OD loses a lot there. And if you’re using a FIFO cache, threading a regular dict through a separate fifo (whether linked list or deque) is more efficient in my experience of implementing both S3 and Sieve. reply judicious 15 hours agorootparentprevI work with different versions of Python3 (and 2 unfortunately) and some code is still in 3.6, hence I used OrderedDicts. reply sgarland 5 hours agorootparentAs someone who just had to backport a fairly large script to support 3.6, I found myself surprised at how much had changed. Dataclasses? Nope. `__future__.annotations`? Nope. `namedtuple.defaults`? Nope. It's also been frustrating with the lack of tooling support. I mean, I get it – it's hideously EOL'd – but I can't use Poetry, uv, pytest... at least it still has type hints. reply neves 5 hours agorootparentNot even VSCode extension works anymore reply mixmastamyk 14 hours agorootparentprev3.6 was the first with the new ordered by default dicts, even though wasn't specc'd until 3.7. reply Izkata 13 hours agorootparentIt worked as an accidental implementation detail in CPython from some other optimization, but it wasn't intentional at the time. Because it wasn't intentional and wasn't part of the spec, that code could be incompatible with other interpreters like pypy or jython. reply ericvsmith 13 hours agorootparentSee my comment and the linked email at https://github.com/ericvsmith/dataclasses?tab=readme-ov-file... for dataclasses and 3.6. I think it's still true. reply raymondh 11 hours agorootparentThe reason Guido didn't want 3.6 to guarantee dict ordering was to protect 3.5 projects from mysteriously failing when using code that implicitly relied on 3.6 behaviors (for example, cutting and pasting a snippet from StackOverflow). He thought that one cycle of \"no ordering assumptions\" would give a smoother transition. All 3.6 implementations would have dict ordering, but it was safer to not have people rely on it right away. reply masklinn 9 hours agorootparentprevpypy implemented naturally ordered dict before cpython did. jython never released a P3 version so is irrelevant, ironpython has yet to progress beyond 3.4 so is also irrelevant. reply matsemann 1 hour agoparentprevI just wish python had some better ergonomics/syntactic sugar working with itertools and friends. Grouping and mapping and filtering and stuff quickly become so unwieldy without proper lambdas etc, especially as the typing is quite bad so after a few steps you're not sure what you even have. Just as recent as today I went to Kotlin to process something semicomplex even though we're a python shop, just because I wanted to bash my head in after a few attempts in python. A DS could probably solve it minutes with pandas or something, but again stringly typed and lots of guesswork. (It was actually a friendly algorithmic competition at work, I won, and even found a bug in the organizer's code that went undetected exactly because of this) reply judicious 50 minutes agorootparentI find converting things from map objects or filter objects back to lists to be a bit clunky. Not to mention chaining operations makes it even more clunky. Some syntatic sugar would go a long way. reply tpoacher 5 hours agoparentprevalso more_itertools ! even less known than itertools, but equally useful. reply mont_tag 9 hours agoparentprevMy faves are the lru_cache, namedtuples, deques, chainmap, and all of the itertools. reply sgarland 5 hours agoprevAdding `array` [0] to the list. It's generally slower than a list, but massively more memory-efficient. You're limited to a heterogeneous type, of course, but they can be quite useful for some operations. [0]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html reply cgopalan 4 hours agoparentYou mean homogenous instead of heterogenous, right? reply tomjakubowski 2 hours agorootparentTo add to this, arrays are also restricted to primitive C types. A Python array object is simply a heap allocated `unsigned long *` or what have you. https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Modules/arraymod... And you can use struct for heterogenous data =) It has a neat DSL for packing/unpacking the data, reminiscent of the \"little languages\" from classic book The Practice of Programming. Python is actually pretty nice working with binary data. https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html reply BiteCode_dev 4 hours agoprevAdd functools to the list. Espacially functools.wraps() and functools.partial(). The stdlib is full of goodies. Now I always appreciated the battery included logic in python. But I noticed this week that LLM diminish that need. It's so easy to prompt for small utilities and saves you from using entire libraries for a few tools. And the AI can create doc and tests for them as quickly. So while I was really enthusiastic things like pairwise() were added to itertools, it's not as revolutionary as before. reply gcr 3 hours agoparentIf you’re saying that LLMs trade idiomatic tools for ease-of-boilerplate-generation, shouldn’t that be a point against them, not in their favor? Pardon the hyperbole but it’s a bit like lauding an IDE for automatically generating thousands of Java class stubs. reply BiteCode_dev 2 hours agorootparentFor decades you had the famous itertools recipes taunting you in the doc: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-r... They were super useful, but not included in the stdlib, despite being a few lines long. We also had more-itertools, bolton, and others, to bridge that gap. Now, there was always a tension between adding more stuff to the stdlib, or letting 3rd party libs handle it. Remember the saying: the stdlib is where projects go to die. And of course tensions about installing full on 3rd party libs just for a few functions. The result is that many people copy/pasted a lot of small utilities, and endless debates on python-ideas to include some more. I think this is going to slow down. Now if you want \"def first_true(iterable, default=False, predicate=None)\", you ask chatgpt, and you don't care. The cost of adding those into the project is negligeable. It's nowhere near generating thousand of class stubs. It's actually the opposite: very targetted, specific code needs being filled instead of haunting python debates or your venv. But to stimulate a bit your anxiety, I do think code gen is going also making a big comeback with LLM :) reply rurp 2 hours agorootparentprevAgreed, rewriting standard functions is much worse than using standard tools that already exist. In addition to the extra boilerplate and reduced readability, that also sounds like an easy way to introduce subtle bugs. Standard library functions have been exhaustively field tested, a similar looking LLM generated function could easily include a footgun. reply BiteCode_dev 2 hours agorootparentSure, but have you tried to introduce a new standard tool in the stdlib? It's not a fun process. Writing the code is the easy part. And installing more-itertools for one functions is a bit silly reply morkalork 1 hour agoparentprevI wish there were some syntactic sugar for partial but knowing how patterns like that get abused in other languages maybe it is for the better that there isn't. reply globular-toast 1 hour agorootparentWhat would it look like?

Maybe I need to suck it up, but I just find venvs and Python packaging in general annoying to deal with, especially for something small.

Nice! When you need it, you need it. It's nice not to have to implement it oneself. reply crabbone 3 hours agoparentOnce I found myself needing to sort something topologically... and the interface to this sorter is so bad that you cannot really retrofit any kind of graph data to make it work with the sorter. So, it's kinda worthless, unless you specifically design your graph to be sorted with this sorter. Also, topological sort is like five lines of code... so, it doesn't matter if the function is there. reply Qem 9 hours agoprev> For people eager to join the AI/ML revolution it provides Naive Bayes classifier - an algorithm that can be considered a minimum viable example of machine learning. I don't think this is true. It allows you to specify and calculate parameters for normal distributions, what allows you to jury rig a naive bayes classifier, what is shown as a doc example. This is not the same as providing a built in classifier. reply guhcampos 3 hours agoprevI've significantly reduced my use of `namedtuple` since DataClasses were introduced, but I confess I never did much performance comparisons between the two. I assume the `namedtuple` syntax is more pleasing for Functional favorable programmers, but this makes me wonder if the stdlib should choose one of them? reply pletnes 3 hours agoparentIn my opinion, namedtuple was created to allow usage of a tuple (they are required in many places) while giving names to the members, rather than plain indexes. reply crabbone 3 hours agoparentprevLast I looked at named tuple implementation, it was along these lines: * generate source code from a template string. * eval generated code. * call constructor. This is woefully slow and wasteful compared to a sensible solution: writing it in C. But, nobody really cares. reply twixfel 3 hours agorootparentI suspect nobody cares because it's not a problem. That bit of code you're moaning about will only be called once per namedtuple. It's unlikely to be a problem. reply crabbone 2 hours agorootparentGuess who cares? The person you replied to... and it would've been really easy to figure that out, given that parent went all the way to look for implementation, isn't it? Anyways. The reason I cared is because I was working on a Protobuf parser, where named tuple was supposed to play a key role: the message class. Imagine my disappointment when I started to run benchmarks. reply flakiness 1 hour agoprevDidn't know \"dis\". It looks nice!

It's not necessarily intuitive that it groups contiguous records. Passing it an unsorted list won't break, but also might not return the results you're expecting. reply tpoacher 5 hours agoprevI was not aware of zipapp ... but it's interesting to see it exists as a method for enabling python to run 'zipped packages' ... since python can already do that by default with normal zipfiles, as long as the zipfile appears / is added to the python path (which is roughly analogous to how one can add .jar files to the classpath in java). E.g.: export PYTHONPATH=\"package.zip\" python3 -m packagename will work just fine. (PS. I document this technique in one of my python-template projects: https://git.sr.ht/~tpapastylianou/python-self-contained-runn...) I suppose, if the intent is to package something in a manner that attempts to make it newbie-proof, then requiring a PYTHONPATH incantation before the python part might be one step too far ... but then again, one could argue the same about people not quite knowing what to do with a .pyz file and getting stuck. reply BiteCode_dev 4 hours agoparentCheckout shiv for turning even more zipapp goodness: https://shiv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ reply openrisk 12 hours agoprevSome modules are essential additions while others are handy so as not to have to manage dependencies. Good example of the latter use case is the statistics module. There is a price to pay though: its performance is 10x slower than numpy. So its mostly useful when the required calculation is not a bottleneck.

If regular sets aren't obscure enough, frozensets might be your thing. It looks like a set, it acts like a set, but its... hashable (for indexing) and (immutable.) Why use this? For algorithms that rely on combinations (not permutations), frozensets can be very useful. E.g. NOT this -- (0, 1) (1, 0) (both distinct using tuples) vs frozenset([0, 1]) ([1, 0] or [0, 1] have the same identity / frozenset.) You can use this for indexing algorithms and things like that.

I also found a use for it recently when changing the underlying storage layer of a class without breaking the API. My other favourite parts of the stdlib are functools and itertools.

And this can open a big security issue as the paramater host of the function \"check_ping\" can be used for a root command injection.

I am at work, but I can open a PR fixing it later. reply runjake 3 hours agoparentIt doesn't need to be fixed. There isn't an issue here. Depending on the OS, ping is either set setuid[1] as root, or more commonly these days, ping is granted a \"capability\"[2], such as CAP_NET_RAW on Linux. macOS does things a little different[3]. This allows non-root users to run stuff like ping without granting them full root access. You do not need to, nor should you, run the script as root. % ls -l /usr/bin/ping -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 89768 Apr 8 09:00 /usr/bin/ping % getcap /usr/bin/ping /usr/bin/ping cap_net_raw=ep ~ % whoami jake ~ % id uid=1000(jake) gid=1000(jake) groups=1000(jake),4(adm),24(cdrom) % ping -c 3 8.8.8.8 PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=0 ttl=117 time=9.195 ms 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=117 time=8.837 ms 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=117 time=10.998 ms --- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics --- 3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 8.837/9.677/10.998/0.946 ms Hope that helps.

Edit: updated explanation a bit. reply trulyrandom 3 hours agorootparentOn Linux, \"net.ipv4.ping_group_range\" is typically used to allow unprivileged users to do ICMP echo requests. Setting the setuid bit or granting a capability are both very old ways of doing this. reply runjake 2 hours agorootparentThis is new to me. So, here's what I see on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS: $ sudo sysctl -agrep net.ipv4.ping net.ipv4.ping_group_range = 1 0 The man page[1] states: ping_group_range (two integers; default: see below; since Linux 2.6.39) Range of the group IDs (minimum and maximum group IDs, inclusive) that are allowed to create ICMP Echo sockets. >>The default is \"1 0\", which means no group is allowed to create ICMP Echo sockets.<< This would seem to indicate this isn't being used -- at least on Ubuntu?

Happy to learn if there's a more nefarious trick that gets around this, though. reply loganmarchione 2 hours agoparentprev [–] Asking because I genuinely don't know, but why not use Python's `urllib.request` instead of `ping`? reply bityard 2 hours agorootparent [–] TL;DR: apples and oranges. Plus, monitoring is hard. \"urllib.request\" sends an HTTP request. It implies that the thing you want to monitor is an HTTP endpoint. Even if that's true, you still have to decide whether you're okay with just getting a 200 status code back, or whether you want to scrape the page for a certain result as your signal of healthy or broken. \"ping\" is an ICMP echo/reply. Ignoring that ICMP messages can be blocked by routers, an ICMP reply can tell you that the host's network interface is alive and that's about all. It doesn't mean any service on that host is online. I have seen hosts that send ICMP replies but were otherwise fully hung by some storage or kernel issue. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originLink": "https://catfox.life/2024/09/05/porting-systemd-to-musl-libc-powered-linux/",
    "originBody": "Porting systemd to musl libc-powered Linux I have completed an initial new port of systemd to musl. This patch set does not share much in common with the existing OpenEmbedded patchset. I wanted to make a fully updated patch series targeting more current releases of systemd and musl, taking advantage of the latest features and updates in both. I also took a focus on writing patches that could be sent for consideration of inclusion upstream. The final result is a system that appears to be surprisingly reliable considering the newness of the port, and very fast to boot. Why? I have wanted to do this work for almost a decade. In fact, a mention of multiple service manager options – including systemd – is present on the original Adélie Web site from 2015. Other initiatives have always taken priority, until someone contacted us at Wilcox Technologies Inc. (WTI) interested in paying on a contract basis to see this effort completed. I want to be clear that I did not do this for money. I believe strongly that there is genuine value in having multiple service managers available. User freedom and user choice matter. There are cases where this support would have been useful to me and to many others in the community. I am excited to see this work nearing public release and honoured to be a part of creating more choice in the Linux world. How? I started with the latest release tag, v256.5. I wanted a version closely aligned to upstream’s current progress, yet not too far away from the present “stable” 255 release. I also wanted to make sure that the fallout from upstream’s removal of split-/usr support would be felt to its maximum, since reverting that decision is a high priority. I fixed build errors as they happened until I finally had a built systemd. During this phase, I consulted the original OE patchset twice: once for usage of GLOB_BRACE, and the other for usage of malloc_info and malloc_trim. Otherwise, the patchset was authored entirely originally, mostly through the day (and into the night) of August 16th, 2024. Many of the issues seen were related to inclusion of headers, and I am already working on bringing those fixes upstream. It was then time to run the test suite. Tests! The test suite started with 27 failures. Most of them were simple fixes, but one that gave me a lot of trouble was the time-util test. The strptime implementation in musl does not support the %z format specifier (for time zones), which the systemd test relies on. I could have disabled those tests, but I felt like this would be taking away a lot of functionality. I considered things like important journals from other systems – they would likely have timestamps with %z formats. I wrote a %z translation for systemd and saw the tests passing. Other test failures were simple C portability fixes, which are also in the process of being sent upstream. The test suite for systemd-sysusers was the next sticky one. It really exercises the POSIX library functions getgrent and getpwent. The musl implementations of these are fine, but they don’t cope well with the old NIS compatibility shims from the glibc world. They also can’t handle “incomplete” lines. The fix for incomplete line handling is pending, so in the meantime I made the test have no incomplete lines. I added a shim for the NIS compatibility entries in systemd’s putgrent_sane function, making it a little less “sane” but fixing the support perfectly. Then it was time for the final failing test: test-recurse-dir, which was receiving an EFAULT error code from getdents64. Discussing this with my friends on the Gentoo IRC, we began to wonder if this was an architecture-specific bug. I was doing my port work on my Talos II, a 64-bit PowerPC system. I copied the code over to an Intel Skylake and found the test suite passed. That was both good, in that the tests were all passing, but also bad, because it meant I was dealing with a PPC64-specific bug. I wasn’t sure if this was a kernel bug, a musl bug, or a systemd bug. Digging into it further, I realised that the pointer math being done would be invalid when cast to a pointer-to-structure on PPC64 due to object alignment guarantees in the ABI. I changed it to use a temporary variable for the pointer math and casting that temporary, and it passed! And that is how I became the first person alive to see systemd passing its entire test suite on a big-endian 64-bit PowerPC musl libc system. The moment of truth I created a small disk image and ran a very strange command: apk add adelie-base-posix dash-binsh systemd. I booted it up as a KVM VM in Qemu and saw “Welcome to Adélie Linux 1.0 Beta 5” before a rather ungraceful – and due to Qemu framebuffer endian issues, colour-swapped – segmentation fault: Welcome to an endian-swapped systemd core dump! Debugging this was an experience in early systems debugging that I haven’t had in years. There’s a great summary on this methodology at Linus’s blog. It turned out that I had disabled a test from build-util as I incorrectly assumed that was only used when debugging in the build root. Since I did not want to spend time digging around how it manually parses ELF files to find their RPATH entries for a feature we are unlikely to use, I stubbed that functionality out entirely. We can always fix it later. Recreating the disk image and booting it up, I was greeted by an Adélie “rescue” environment booted by systemd. It was frankly bizarre, but also really cool. The first time systemd ever booted an Adélie Linux system. From walking to flying Next, I built test packages on the Skylake builder we are using for x86_64 development. I have a 2012 MacBook Pro that I keep around for testing various experiments, and this felt like a good system for the ultimate experiment. The goal: swapping init systems with a single command. It turns out that D-Bus and PolicyKit require systemd support to be enabled or disabled at build-time. There is no way to build them in a way that allows them to operate on both types of init system. This is an area I would like to work on more in the future. I wrote package recipes for both that are built against systemd and “replace” the non-systemd versions. I also marked them to install_if the system wanted systemd. Next up were some more configuration and dependency fixes. I found out via this experiment that some of the Adélie system packages do not place their pkg-config files in the proper place. I also decided that if I’m already testing this far, I’d use networkd to bring up the laptop in question. I ran the fateful command apk del openrc; apk add systemd and rebooted. To my surprise, it all worked! The system booted up perfectly with systemd. The oddest sight was my utmps units running: systemd running s6-ipcserver. The irony is not lost on me. Still needed: polish… While the system works really well, and boots in 1/3rd the time of OpenRC on the same system, it isn’t ready for prime time just yet. Rebooting from a KDE session causes the compositor to freeze. I can reboot manually from a command line, or even from a Konsole inside the session, but not using Plasma’s built-in power buttons. This may be a PolicyKit issue – I haven’t debugged it properly yet. There aren’t any service unit files written or packaged yet, other than OpenSSH and utmps. We are working with our sponsor on an effort to add -systemd split packages to any of the packages with -openrc splits. We should be able to rely on upstream units where present, and lean on Gentoo and Fedora’s systemd experts to have good base files to reference when needed. I’ve already landed support for this in abuild. …and You! This project could not have happened without the generous sponsors of Wilcox Technologies Inc (WTI) making it possible, nor without the generous sponsors of Adélie Linux keeping the distro running. Please consider supporting both Adélie Linux and WTI if you have the means. Together, we are creating the future of Linux systems – a future where users have the choice and freedom to use the tooling they desire. If you want to help test this new system out, please reach out to me on IRC (awilfox on Interlinked or Libera), or the Adéliegram Telegram channel. It will be a little while before a public beta will be available, as more review and discussion with other projects is needed. We are working with systemd, musl, and other projects to make this as smooth as possible. We want to ensure that what we provide for testing is up to our highest standards of quality.

Note that this is a musl port, and that the existing musl port is from OpenEmbedded. It's embedded devices that are often using cut-down userspaces (e.g. using MUSL), and embedded devices often do care about startup time because they're not Always-On. E.g. the VTech baby monitor I've just bought is generally pretty good, but spends >10 seconds at a splash screen when you turn it on. No idea if it's Linux under the hood, but an optimised boot time would be great. In a previous work project, we need the Linux based software to be ready from low power state quickly (battery powered, only doing work occasionally). By getting the boot time downlike, why would using a certain percentage of my total space be fine, what if all programs thought that? Because the journal’s role in a system is inherently different than most programs. It’s collecting logs for everything; not just itself. It seems reasonable to me that a system-wide service would use a percentage of the system’s resources. Plus, if you don’t like it, reconfigure it. It’s only the default, after all. reply boring_twenties 2 hours agorootparent> Plus, if you don’t like it, reconfigure it. It’s only the default, after all.

But. The one thing that frustrates me about the journal is that there is only one journal. If I have a chatty app, it can entirely take over the journal. Set a 1GB hour al, come back in a couple days, and nothing else is left in the journal other than it logging. I hate this so much. If I could assign some apps to a secondary journal, or better quota individual services, that would make sure I can keep tabs on my entire system, even when one app is logging heavily. reply hackernudes 4 hours agorootparentCheck out the LogNamespace option. reply mixmastamyk 1 hour agorootparentprevTangentially I now have to remove systemd-resolved on each machine. It gets too complicated because I use dnsmasq on family machines and resolved is always trying to open ports to the internet (opensnitch knows).

Network manager is involved also. reply btreecat 6 hours agoparentprevThe biggest issue I ran into with OpenRC was the lack of metadata related to hot-plugging events. There currently is no way to fire specific events based on vendor/device id like you would with systemd. This forced me to write a shim script to enable USB passthrough with arbitrary k8s nodes. The shim was short but is very hacky and relies on 3p packages because the info needed isn't available in stock alpine. Blog post about it here: https://stephentanner.com/home-assistant-on-k3s.html Follow up post in the works based on additional improvements up streamed to OpenRC.

Think of your media console in your car. Have you actually profiles that copying the 500mb rootfs is the bulk of your boot time? At around 150MiB/s, which is common for USB these days, I would expect that to only take ~4s, and copying from ram location to ram location is far faster. I would expect your boot time is a lot longer than that. reply nine_k 5 hours agorootparentIDK; on my laptop, the boot time is dominated by opening the encrypted disk. From there it's well under 3 seconds to the Xfce login screen. (A T14, m.2 storage, runit as the init system.) reply graemep 4 hours agorootparentI find the same. Combine that with sleep being far more frequent that restart, and boot times are unimportant. I think the need for faster boot comes from people who scale cloud servers or containers up and down a lot. reply wed239023 6 hours agorootparentprevBootloader most likely operates in much slower safe mode. Perhaps USB2, or even 1.1. reply account42 5 hours agorootparentprevI don't think there are any devices where \"withing a few seconds\" is a useful target for the startup sequence. Most devices should really be instant, which means hibernation / full memory snapshots and your real boot system becomes mostly irrelevent. Everything else is really in \"meh\" territory. That said, OpenRC is already quite fast and both my laptop and desktop boot in a few seconds using it - the EFI takes much longer to do whatever it does and hand control off to the kernel than it takes from kernel to desktop login screen. reply zja 6 hours agoparentprevBoot times are pretty important for serverless environments. Alpine, which uses musl, is very popular in those situations. reply blueflow 6 hours agorootparentI thought serverless environments are containers and thus don't need to boot? reply tuetuopay 4 hours agorootparentnowadays serverless environments are microvms. that is, a standard machine type that is explicitly virtual (so device drivers have no wait time for hw to init). however, they don't either need userspace to boot because the function/application/whatever is likely init itself or not far off. so they need to boot, but only the kernel needs to boot. reply amaccuish 6 hours agorootparentprevThey still have a userspace to bring up. reply djbusby 5 hours agorootparentAnd don't need systemd for that. reply blueflow 6 hours agoparentprevWith the musl/busybox/OpenRC stack, Alpine is top notch when it comes to battery use.

So I doubt if systemd and its subsystems are using much energy. It doesn't seem likely to explain 20 vs 8 hours battery. reply RealStickman_ 4 hours agorootparentprevCould probably get similar improvements by using any distro with less \"batteries included\" than Debian.

But many devices today do not support it anymore, instead they support S2Idle. S2Idle is more power-efficient than running-idle but less efficient than even Standby. Its huge advantage is waking up virtually immediately. Linux has no problems running S2Idle but due to how S2Idle works, more components can wake up your system, therefore more components can misbehave, incl. devices attached by USB.

In fact, I've has issues with sleep sometimes not waking up and the system hangs with a blank screen forcing a reset obliterating my session. In addition to that, sleep takes 20+ seconds to power down whereas a shutdown takes about 3 seconds. systemd to me isn't useful at all for the desktop and is a big contraption for firing off VM's and containers in a highly automated server environment.

I was under the impression that OpenRC and systemd support similar parallel service startup features and usually boot systems in approximately the same amount of time, with maybe a slight edge to systemd. 3x speed makes me wonder if there's something else going on, like the current early systemd port having some bugs that cause it to incorrectly skip some important work.

It's more than a little platform effect going on, it's not all by virtue of systemd being just all over great. It has some great ideas but it's an entire world unto itself which feels very NIH-ish. Edit: I think it serves as both a warning and an inspiration. Don't let a duct tape solution (such as for instance boot via rc shell files) live for too long, or it might be replaced by something baroque. reply mardifoufs 5 hours agorootparentBut systemd was already widely supported not even 2 or 3 years after its original release. The reason it built its network effect is because it was better. Sure, a lot of it is also due to the classic Redhat NIH and their marketing push for their own solutions regardless of if other stuff already exists, but in this specific case systemd was also very very useful from the get go. reply trueismywork 8 hours agorootparentprevIdeas are just 1% if implementation.

And it's nigh impossible to replace for various reasons, including at one point critical interfaces that various user-important programs depended on being a constant treadmill of updates, lack of documentation, and hidden dependencies on internals. reply awilfox 7 hours agorootparentIt's true. systemd has a lot of good ideas with questionable implementations. I'd love networkd if it didn't have silly decisions made. And it has some questionable ideas with good implementations. For example, I hate the journal, but admit it is implemented well. At the end of the day, it's about tradeoffs and using what suits the system at hand. For some people that will be systemd, and bringing systemd to Adélie and other musl libc distributions means that it can be used by those people. Call me old-fashioned, but I also hold out hope that at least some of those questionable implementations could be fixed if only someone with the desire would write a patch and send it upstream. Bringing systemd to musl means the people in musl land that aren't knee-jerk anti-systemd maybe might be more enthused to do just that, improving it for everyone using it. reply btreecat 6 hours agorootparentprevDo you have specific examples or just general grievances rehashing past claims? reply actionfromafar 6 hours agorootparentCan't specific examples be rehashes of past grievances?

It's a design difference - systemd assumes services know whether they are intended to run once or restart under various conditions. If you want that behaviour it's just a matter of a tweak to the .service file. > Also, everything's so opaque that I can't figure out why nftables ruleset isn't loaded on boot Has it been disabled?

I used OpenRC because, not knowing about logind.conf, i had no other choice. reply doublerabbit 6 hours agorootparentprev> There is a reason systemd took over, its massively supported and widely tested. Partly due to that it's funded and forced upon by corporate. Any product can excel if resources are available. reply Foxboron 5 hours agorootparentNobody forced us, Arch Linux, to adopt systemd. reply mrfinn 8 hours agorootparentprevYes, it's massively sponsored as well. So it went heavily imposed almost everywhere even when a quite big chunk of the Linux community deeply disagreed about the imposition. reply SubjectToChange 7 hours agorootparentPeople seem to not appreciate that Lennart Poettering managed to get systemd from concept to shipping in RHEL 7 in under four years. At that point I'm not even sure anyone at Red Hat had even asked for it, they had already transitioned to Upstart for RHEL 6 after all. Whatever your opinion of Poettering may be, you have to admit that he has tenacity. So it went heavily imposed almost everywhere even when a quite big chunk of the Linux community deeply disagreed about the imposition. There is a substantial selection bias in the complaints towards systemd. At the very least it seems that Red Hat's customers didn't have a problem with it. For most Linux users, it was a minor change, but for distro maintainers it was a massive relief[1]. Again, Lennart Poettering actually took the initiative to develop systemd and get it adopted. By comparison, detractors of systemd did not develop a competitive alternative. Thus, it's hardly a surprise that systemd ended up steamrolling the competition. Ultimately systemd is what users deserve because no person or company bothered to make something better.

But anyway, for me it really doesn't matter. It's the beauty of free software. reply imtringued 5 hours agorootparentprevSo far most of the complaints about systems are really all about the fact that there is no real competitor to systemd. The argument that systemd is difficult to replace says more about the state of the rest of Linux user land, than it says about systemd, since most of the benefits of systemd are easy to replicate. reply SubjectToChange 4 hours agorootparentWriting another init system isn't exactly something most people would want to spend years of their life on. At best, it'd take a few years to reach some limited parity with where systemd is today. Furthermore, most of the systemd detractors fundamentally object the philosophy of systemd. So how can they meaningfully innovate over upstart and/or runit? It's either developing systemd-lite or a more elaborate ball of scripts. Even then, there is the issue of convincing distributions to adapt your new init system. The reality is that systemd arrived at a time when Linux distributions were dying to move off of sysvinit. Poettering struck when the metal was hot and he delivered a comprehensive tool that greatly reduced the burden on maintainers. Sure, nothing lasts forever, but it will be many years (if not decades) before systemd is slated for replacement. reply otabdeveloper4 6 hours agorootparentprev> heavily imposed Not really. The community Linuxes which aren't corporate-sponsored (Arch, NixOS) were the first aboard the systemd train.

That I kind concur with him, instead of workaround missing functions it may be better to just write a compatibility library that complements musl with the missing functions. This way, any program that needs those functions could just import this library if they're compiling in a non-glibc system. I am seeing that lots of the fixes proposed by the author are things like \"missing import because glibc exposes some symbols by mistake and musl does not\". And this is definitely the kind of fix that upstream would accept[2].

Still, the musl malloc implementation is just the most infamous example of its subpar performance. Obviously glibc comes with an enormous amount of functionality and performance optimizations. Somewhat unrelated, but I'm looking forward to llvm-libc becoming a practical replacement for musl. I'd love a modern, non-gnu libc implementation that isn't so dogmatic. reply pantalaimon 3 hours agoparentprevIt’s often the case that you can trade size for speed - musl tries to be small, glibc tries to be fast.

TL;DR: Musl developers don't want to make it 100% compatible with glibc because a lot of glibc is retarded; Systemd developers don't want to avoid glibc functionality in favour of pure and holy POSIX because a lot of POSIX is retarded, and nobody actually runs pure POSIX Linux systems anyway. Seems to me they are both right. Probably the best solution is a compromise where Musl implements some of the most commonly used / difficult to emulate functions, and systemd avoids using the rest. Won't hold my breath though. reply asveikau 4 hours agorootparentThe systemd people are absolutely not right here. Just look at some of the interfaces they won't give up. malloc_info writes XML to a FILE* with state of the allocator. That is a comically bad interface. Why you'd even want the state it describes in the first place I can't tell. malloc, realloc and free are the complete primitives for 50 years but somehow systemd can't function until it can spit out a few numbers into XML on top of this, for reasons? In the patchset for TFA, I was surprised to see the comment for the commit that makes this functionality conditional is marked as \"this can't be upstreamed.\" Makes upstream sound like a bunch of babies. reply IshKebab 3 hours agorootparent> That is a comically bad interface. I imagine it was added for debugging purposes. It looks like systemd uses it for that purpose too. Not unreasonable, though I agree, XML is a stupid output format. Supposedly so the output format can change.... and silently break clients. Really systemd should work with glibc to make their APIs saner, and then musl can copy them. reply ruthmarx 5 hours agoparentprevHonestly thank goodness. Choice is great and all that but I don't want system to infect Alpine or it's ecosystem at all.

You're allowed to use another init system, and the distros CHOSE systemd. Nothing is stopping you, it's just that nobody does it because: 1. Pretty much nothing is as good as systemd as a whole project. Stringing together 30 random packages is a huge pain. 2. Other init systems are much slower, and turns out people care about performance. 3. Other init systems are less functional, with less features which some users want. 4. Writing a competing init system is very hard, while complaining is both easy and fun. In the hypothetical case of Alpine switching to systemd, you're 100% free to maintain your own Alpine distro or even maintain your own init system or just switch to a different one. reply ruthmarx 19 minutes agorootparentI disagree with most of your points, which I will say are very subjective at a minimum, but specifically > In the hypothetical case of Alpine switching to systemd, you're 100% free to maintain your own Alpine distro This is the problem.

    "title": "Building a WoW (World of Warcraft) Server in Elixir",
    "originLink": "https://pikdum.dev/posts/thistle-tea/",
    "originBody": "Building a WoW server in Elixir July 14, 2024 Thistle Tea is my new World of Warcraft private server project. You can log in, create a character, run around, and cast spells to kill mobs, with everything synchronized between players as expected for an MMO. It was floating around in my head to build this for a while, since I have an incurable nostalgia for early WoW. I first mentioned this on May 13th and didn’t expect to get any further than login, character creation, and spawning into the map. Here’s a recount of the first month of development. Prep Work Before coding, I did some research and came up a plan. Code this in Elixir, using the actor model. MaNGOS has done the hard work on collecting all the data, so use it. Use Thousand Island as the socket server. Treat this project as an excuse to learn more Elixir. Reference existing projects and documentation rather than working from scratch. Speed along the happy path rather than try and handle every error. Day 1 - June 2nd There are two main parts to a World of Warcraft server: the authentication server and the game server. Up first was authentication, since you can’t do anything without logging in. To learn more about the requests and responses, I built a quick MITM proxy between the client and a MaNGOS server to log all packets. It wasn’t as useful as expected, since not much was consistent, but it did help me internalize how the requests and responses worked. The first byte of an authentication packet is the opcode, which indicates which message it is, and the rest is a payload with the relevant data. I was able to extract the fields from the payload by pattern matching on the binary data. The auth flow can be simplified as: Client sends a CMD_AUTH_LOGON_CHALLENGE packet Server sends back some data for the client to use in crypto calculations Client sends a CMD_AUTH_LOGON_PROOF packet with the client proof If the client proof matches what’s expected, server sends over the server_proof Client is now authenticated It uses SRP6, which I hadn’t heard of before this. Seems like the idea is to avoid transmitting an unencrypted password and instead both the client and server independently calculate a proof that only matches if they both know the correct password. If the proof matches, then authentication is successful. So basically, what I needed to do was: Listen for data over the socket Once data received, parse what message it is out of the header section Handle each one differently Send back the appropriate packet This whole part is well documented, but I still ran into some issues with the cryptography. Luckily, I found a blog post and an accompanying Elixir implementation, so I was able to substitute my broken cryptography with working cryptography. Without that, I would’ve been stuck at this part for a very long time (maybe forever). Wasn’t able to get login working on day 1, but I was close. Links: https://wowdev.wiki/Login http://srp.stanford.edu/design.html https://shadowburn-project.org/2018/10/17/logging-in-with-vanilla.html https://gitlab.com/shadowburn/shadowburn https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/binaries-strings-and-charlists.html Day 2 - June 3rd I spent some time cleaning up the code and found a logic error where I reversed some crypto bytes that weren’t supposed to be. Fixing that made auth work, finally getting a success with hardcoded credentials. Next up was getting the realm list to work, by handling CMD_REALM_LIST and returning which game server to connect to. This got me out of the tedious auth bits and I could get to building the game server. Links: https://wowdev.wiki/CMD_REALM_LIST_Client https://wowdev.wiki/CMD_REALM_LIST_Server Day 3 - June 4th The goal for today was to get spawned into the world. But first more tedious auth bits. The game server auth flow can be simplified as: When client first connects, server sends SMSG_AUTH_CHALLENGE, with a random seed Client sends back CMSG_AUTH_SESSION, with another client proof If client proof matches server proof, server sends a successful SMSG_AUTH_RESPONSE This negotaties how to encrypt/decrypt future packet headers. Luckily Shadowburn also had crypto code for this, so I was able to use it here. The server proof requires a value previously calculated by the authentication server, so I used an Agent to store that session value. It worked, but I later refactored it to use ETS for a simpler interface. After that, it’s something like: Client sends message to server Server decrypts header, which contains message size (2 bytes) and opcode (4 bytes) Server handles message and sends back 0 or more messages to client First was handling CMSG_CHAR_CREATE and CMSG_CHAR_ENUM, so I could create and list characters. I originally used an Agent for storage here as well, which made things quick to prototype. Then I got side-tracked for a bit trying to get equipment to show up, since I had all the equipment display ids hardcoded to 0. I looked through the MaNGOS database and hardcoded a few proper display ids before moving on. After that was handling CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN. I found an example minimal SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT spawn packet, which was supposed to spawn me in Northshire Abbey. That’s probably the most important packet, since it does everything from: Spawning things into the world, like players, mobs, objects, etc. Updating their values, like health, position, level, etc. It has a lot of different forms, can batch multiple object updates into a single packet, and has a compressed variant. Whoops, had the coordinates a bit off. After fixing that, I was in the human starting area as expected. No player model yet, though. I thought movement was broken, but it turns out all keybinds were being unset on every login, so the movement keys just weren’t bound. Manually navigating to the keybinding configuration and resetting them to default allowed me to move around. Next up was adding more to that spawn packet to use the player race and proper starting area. The starting areas were grabbed from a MaNGOS database that I converted over to SQLite and wired up with Ecto. Last for the night was to get logout working. The implementation was something like: After receiving a CMSG_LOGOUT_REQUEST, use Process.send_after/3 to queue a :login_complete message that would send SMSG_LOGOUT_COMPLETE to the client in 20 seconds Store a reference to that timer in state If received a CMSG_LOGOUT_CANCEL, cancel the timer and remove it from state This was the first piece that really took advantage of Elixir’s message passing. The white chat box was weird, but it was nice being able to log in. Links: https://wowdev.wiki/Opcodes https://wowdev.wiki/SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT https://gtker.com/wow_messages/docs/smsg_update_object.html https://gtker.com/wow_messages/ir/implementing_world.html https://github.com/vdechef/mysql2sqlite Day 4 - June 5th First up was reorganizing the code, since my game.ex GenServer was getting too large. My strategy for that was: Split out related messages into separate files auth.ex, character.ex, ping.ex, etc. wrapped in the __using__ macro Include those back into game.ex with use It worked, but it messed with line numbers in error messages and made things harder to debug. After that, I wanted to generate that spawn packet properly rather than hardcoding. The largest piece of this was figuring out the update mask for the update fields. There are a ton of fields for the different types of objects SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT handles. Before the raw object fields in the payload, there’s a bit mask with bits set at offsets that correspond to the fields being sent. Without that, the client wouldn’t know what to do with the values. So, I needed to write a function that would generate this bit mask from the fields I pass in. Luckily it’s all well documented, but it still took a while to get to a working implementation. Links: https://gtker.com/wow_messages/types/update-mask.html https://gtker.com/wow_messages/docs/object.html Day 5 - June 6th Referencing MaNGOS, I added some more messages that the server sends to the client after a CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN. One of these, SMSG_ACCOUNT_DATA_TIMES, fixed the white chat box and keybinds being reset. I also added SMSG_COMPRESSED_UPDATE_OBJECT, which compresses the SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT packet with :zlib.compress/1. This was more straightforward than expected, and I made things use the compressed variant if it’s actually smaller. I’m expecting this to have even more benefits when I get to batching object updates, but right now I’m only updating objects one by one. Movement would come up soon, so I started adding the handlers for those packets. Day 6 - June 7th In the update packet, I still had the object guid hardcoded. This is because it wants a packed guid and I needed to write some functions to handle that. Rather than the entire guid, a packed guid is a byte mask followed by all non-zero bytes. The byte mask has bits set that correspond to where the following bytes go in the unpacked guid. This is for optimizing packet size, since a guid is always 8 bytes but a packed guid can be as small as 2 bytes. This took a while, because the client was crashing when I changed the packed guid from > to anything else. After trying different things and wasting a lot of time, I realized that the guid was in two places in the packet and they needed to match. A quick fix later and things were working as expected. Links: https://gtker.com/wow_messages/types/packed-guid.html Day 7 - June 8th It was about time to start implementing the actual MMO features, starting with seeing other players. To test, I hardcoded another update packet after the player’s with a different guid, to try and spawn something other than the player. Then I used a Registry to keep track of logged in players and their spawn packets. After entering the world, I would use Registry.dispatch/3 to: spawn all logged in players for that player spawn that player for all other players both using SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT After that, I added a similar dispatch when handling movement packets to broadcast movement to all other players. This is where the choice of Elixir really started to shine, and I quickly had players able to see each other move around the screen. I tested this approach with multiple windows open and it was very cool to see everything synchronized. I added a handler for CMSG_NAME_QUERY to get names to stop showing up as Unknown and also despawned players with SMSG_DESTROY_OBJECT when logging out. This is where I started noticing a bug: occasionally I wouldn’t be able to decrypt a packet successfully, which would lead to all future attempts for that connection failing too, since there’s a counter as part of the decryption function. I couldn’t figure out how to resolve it yet, though, or reliably reproduce.

I only focused on /say here and it’s all players rather than nearby. Something to fix later. Related to that weird decryption bug, I handled the case where the server received more than one packet at once. This might’ve helped a bit, but didn’t completely resolve the issue. Links: https://gtker.com/wow_messages/docs/cmsg_messagechat.html https://gtker.com/wow_messages/docs/smsg_messagechat.html Day 9 - June 10th I still had authentication with a hardcoded username, password, and salt, so it was about time to fix that. Rather than go with PostgreSQL or SQLite for the database, I decided to go with Mnesia, since one of my goals was to learn more about Elixir and its ecosystem. I briefly tried plain :mnesia, but decided to use Memento for a cleaner interface. So, I added models for Account and Character and refactored everything to use them. The character object is kept in process state and only persisted to the database on logout or disconnect. Saving on a CMSG_PING or just periodically could be a good idea too, eventually. Right now data isn’t persisted to disk, since I’m still iterating on the data model, but that should be straightforward to toggle later. Links: https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/mnesia.html https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/storage/mnesia https://github.com/sheharyarn/memento Day 10 - June 11th Today was standardizing the logging, handling a bit more of chat, and handling an unencrypted CMSG_PING. I was thinking that could be part of the intermittent decryption issues too, but looking back I don’t think I’ve ever had my client send that unencrypted anyways. Day 11 - June 12th I wanted equipment working so players weren’t naked all the time, so I started on that. Using the MaNGOS item_template table, I wired things up to set random equipment on character creation. Then I added that to the response to CMSG_CHAR_ENUM so they would show up in the login screen. Up next was getting it showing in game. Day 12 - June 13th It took a bit to figure out the proper offsets for each piece of equipment in the update mask, but I eventually got it working. Since equipment is part of the update object packet, it just worked for other players, which was nice. Day 13 - June 14th I had player movement synchronizing between players properly so I wanted to get sitting working too. Whoops. Weird things happen when field offsets or sizes are incorrect when building that update mask. After that, I wanted to play around a bit by randomizing equipment on every jump. Here I learned that you need to send all fields in the update object packet, like health, or they get reset. I was trying to just send the equipment changes but I’d die on every jump. After making sure to send all fields, it was working as expected. Day 14 - June 15th Took a break. Day 15 - June 16th Today was refactoring and improvements. I reworked things into proper modules, since it was getting hard to debug when all the line numbers were wrong. Now game.ex called the appropriate module’s handle_packet/3 function, rather than combining everything with use. I also reworked things so players were spawned with their current position instead of the initial position saved in the registry. This included some changes to make building an update packet more straightforward. Day 16 - June 17th Today was just playing around and no code changes. Not sure why the model is messed up here, but it seems like it’s something with my computer rather than anything server related. Day 17 - June 18th The world was feeling a bit empty, so I wanted to spawn in mobs. First was hardcoding an update packet that should spawn a mob and having it trigger on /say. After that, I used the creature table of the MaNGOS database to get proper mobs spawning. I used a GenServer for this so every mob would be a process and keep track of their own state. Communication between mobs and players would happen through message passing. First I hardcoded a few select ids in the starting area to load, and after that worked I loaded them all. Rather than spawn all ~57k mobs for the player, I wired things up to only spawn mobs within a certain range. This looked like: Store mob pids in a Registry, along with their x, y, z position Create a within_range/2 function that takes in two x, y, z tuples On player login, dispatch on that MobRegistry, using within_range/2 to only build spawn packets for mobs within range On player movement, do the same It worked really well and I could run around and see the mobs. Next up was optimization and despawning mobs that were now out of range. Day 18 - June 19th For optimization, I didn’t want to send duplicate spawn packets for mobs that were already spawned. I also wanted to despawn mobs that were out of range. To do this, I used ETS to track which guids were spawned for a player. In the dispatch, the logic was: if in_range and not spawned, spawn if not in_range and spawned, despawn otherwise, ignore Despawning was done through the same SMSG_DESTROY_OBJECT packet used for despawning a player after logging out. After getting that working, I ran around the world and explored for a bit. I noticed something wrong when exploring Westfall. Bugs were spawning in the air and then falling down to the ground. Turns out I wasn’t separating mobs by map, so Westfall had mobs from Silithus mixed in. To fix, I reworked both the mob and player registries to use the map as the key. Having mobs standing in place was a bit boring and I wanted them to move around. Turns out this is pretty complicated and I’ll actually have to use the map files to generate paths that don’t float or clip through the ground. There are a few projects for this, all a bit difficult to include in an Elixir project. I’m thinking RPC could work, but not sure if it’ll be performant enough yet. The standard update object packet can be used for mob movement here, since it has a movement block, but there might be some more specialized packets to look into later too. Without using the map data, I couldn’t get the server movement to line up with what happened in the client. So, I settled with getting mobs to spin at random speeds. That was a bit silly and used a lot of CPU, so I tweaked it to just randomly change orientation instead. Links: https://gtker.com/wow_messages/docs/movementblock.html https://gtker.com/wow_messages/docs/compressedmove.html https://github.com/namreeb/namigator Day 19 - June 20th Here I got mob names working by implementing CMSG_CREATURE_QUERY. This crashed the client when querying mobs that didn’t have a model, so I removed them from being loaded. I also started loading in mob movement data and optimized the query a bit to speed up startup. I finally got some people to help me test the networking later that day. It didn’t start very well. Turns out I hadn’t tested this locally since adding mobs and the player/mob spawn/despawns were conflicting with each other due to guid collisions. Players were being constantly spawned in and out. I did some emergency patching to make it so players are never despawned, even out of range. I also turned off /say spawning boars since that was getting annoying. That worked for now. There were still some major issues. My helper had 450 ms latency and would crash when running to areas with a lot of mobs. I couldn’t reproduce, though, with my 60 ms latency. Links: https://gtker.com/wow_messages/docs/cmsg_creature_query.html https://gtker.com/wow_messages/docs/smsg_creature_query_response.html Day 20 - June 21 To reproduce the issue from the previous night, I connected to my local server from my laptop on the same network. On my laptop, I used tc to simulate a ton of latency and wired things up so equipment would change on any movement instead of just jump. This sent a lot of packets when spinning and I was finally able to reproduce. Turns out the crashing issues were from not receiving a complete packet, but still trying to decrypt and handle it. I was handling if the server got more than one packet, but not if the server got a partial packet. Referencing Shadowburn’s implementation, the fix for this was to let the packet data accumulate until there’s enough to handle. This finally resolved the weird decryption issue I ran into on day 7. For the guid collision issue, I added a large offset to creature guids so they won’t conflict with player guids. Day 21 - June 22 Took a break. Day 22 - June 23 Worked on CMSG_ITEM_NAME_QUERY a bit, but there’s still something wrong here. It could be that it’s trying to calculate damage using some values I’m not passing to the client yet. Decided spells would be next, so I started on that. First was sending spells over with SMSG_INITIAL_SPELLS on login, using the initial spells in MaNGOS, so I’d have something in the spellbook. Everything was instant cast though, for some reason. Turns out I needed to set unit_mod_cast_speed in the player update packet for cast times to show up properly in the client. I started by handling CMSG_CAST_SPELL, which would send a successful SMSG_CAST_RESULT after the spell cast time, so other spells could be cast. I also handled CMSG_CANCEL_CAST, to cancel that timer. This implementation looked a bit like the logout logic. The starting animation for casting a spell would play, but no cast bar or anything further.

Day 27 - June 28 I was able to get a cast bar showing up by sending SMSG_SPELL_START after receiving the cast spell packet. The projectile effect took a bit longer to figure out. I needed to send a SMSG_SPELL_GO after the cast was complete, with the proper target guids. Links: https://gtker.com/wow_messages/docs/smsg_spell_start.html https://gtker.com/wow_messages/docs/smsg_spell_go.html Day 28 - June 29 I got self-cast spells working by setting the target guid to the player’s guid. Day 29 - June 30 Another break. Day 30 - July 1 Since I had spells somewhat working, next I had to clean up the implementation. I dispatched the SMSG_SPELL_START and SMSG_SPELL_GO packets to nearby players and fixed spell cancelling. Day 31 - July 2 I added levels to mobs, random from their minimum to maximum level, previously hardcoded 1. Then I made spells do some hardcoded damage, so mobs could die. Mobs would still randomly change orientation when dead, so added a check to only move if alive. That seemed like a good stopping point and was one month since I started writing code for the project. Future Plans I’ll slowly work on this, adding more functionality as I go. My goal isn’t a 1:1 Vanilla server, but more something that fits well with Elixir’s capabilities, so I don’t plan on accepting limitations for the sake of accuracy or similar. I’d like to see how many players this approach can handle and how it compares in performance to other implementations eventually too. Some things on the list: proper mob + player stats proper damage calculations pvp quests mob movement + combat ai loot + inventory management more spells + effects tons of refactoring benchmarking gameplay loop, in general So still plenty more work to do. :) Thanks to all the projects I’ve referenced for this, most of which I’ve tried to link here. I wouldn’t have gotten very far without them and their awesome documentation. Tags: Elixir World of Warcraft Programming Comments",

Looking at the game when others play it makes me think that I would be so happy if I could experience it with a group of friends. Maybe if I retire and by some miracle know enough people, we can get together and form an awesome guild, and explore the world for the first time? reply bluescrn 6 hours agorootparentThe Covid lockdown period coincided quite nicely with WoW Classic. But the experience of Classic WoW now is nothing like its early months (now 20 years ago!). It's a 'solved' game now, everything is known, documented, data mined, and optimized. Players rush to max level using optimized routes to then join guilds of like-minded players to speed-run the raids. Little tolerance for 'noobs'. The sense of adventure and exploration is long-gone. reply tikkabhuna 5 hours agorootparentI can't agree enough with this. WoW back in the day was a little wild west, you could go to Wowhead or was it Thottbot (?) for information but it wasn't great. You could really explore and forge your own path. I rejoined for WoW Classic and to be honest playing without all my old friends was just quite sad. I had the same experience with CoD Warzone. It took off during Covid and I could play with a bunch of mates and people could run different loadouts and strategies. By the time Warzone 2 came out, everything is, like you said, optimized and little room for error. I honestly think streamers have ruined games with progression. There's too much drive to be at the top and too little focus on just enjoying the game. reply kubb 5 hours agorootparentprevIn a group you could theoretically run an ssf mode where your group is isolated from the rest of the world, and your enjoyment isn’t spoiled by people who have more experience than you. reply ffsm8 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's a cultural issue though. All (multiplayer/online) games can be considered \"solved\" as the practice of min maxing has become the norm. Sure, there are always a few days to weeks while the min/maxers are figuring things out, but that's generally not enough time for someone that's not a streamer to experience the content before a \"solution\" is provided. reply robrtsql 6 hours agorootparentprevI used to feel that way. I recently (well, 2 or 3 years ago..) started playing Final Fantasy XIV. I think a lot of MMOs these days have quality-of-life improvements so that you no longer have to “nolife” the game if you don’t want to. For example, I knew people who played WoW who joined a guild and then had to keep their weekend evenings open so they could raid with the guild. Nowadays, these games come with matchmaking so you can find a group of players to complete a dungeon with (the only exception is the hardest content, where you are unlikely to find 7 other random players who are prepared enough to play them). It turns out playing an MMO is a lot more manageable now. reply 127 5 hours agorootparentI think for a casual player who doesn't want another job to raid in WoW, FF XIV is really nice go your own pace alternative. Plus the 10-year long story arc is really good. You can go as fast or as slow as you want, you don't need to worry about gearing to get into dungeons or raids. There's a ton of content. WoW has better core gameplay (more fun to click buttons and kill simple mobs), more responsive, much more active open world, better quality of life. Final Fantasy has better boss fights, much more immersive and coherent storyline, no need for alts to try different classes. reply foobarkey 6 hours agorootparentprevBlizzard sometimes launches new classic progress from scratch, right now bit wowed out but in 5-10 years I could go one more round - hopefully this is still a thing in 20-30 years, seems like a good retirement hobby instead of bingo reply hakanderyal 4 hours agorootparentprevIt was some of the best years of my life, perfect storm of time availability and means to play it. But it really is addictive once you give in to it. I was playing 10+ hours per day, every day, for months. reply cacois 7 hours agorootparentprevThat's a lovely vision. If by the same miracle I retire around the same time, I'm in - haven't played since college, so I'm sure its hardly the same game I knew. reply AmericanChopper 7 hours agorootparentprevI used to play wow a lot, and it was fun… when I was young. When you have few responsibilities, and all of your friends also have few responsibilities you can invest a lot of time into leisure activities like this without giving much up. The problem I see with games in general is that so many of them are now designed to dominate your time the way wow does. I somewhat recently used to play Warzone once a week (or once every other week) with a group of friends, and that’s a game that you should be able to pick up, play for a couple of hours, and come back whenever you want and play for a few more hours. But it’s not. New content comes out all the time, and a whole new game comes out once a year. If you don’t stay on top of it, you just don’t get the proper experience of the game. So once my casual level of interest drops below the level of time the game demands from you, I just give up playing it. This trend of a constant demand for grinding and micro transactions has creeped into way too many products imo, and the conclusion I’ve come to is that most of these games are just not made for people like me any more. reply jauntywundrkind 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's been well over a decade since I played EVE Online, and man, there's so many really compelling gaming-with-other-oeiple experiences I would love to be having there.

Sometimes I get depressed about that, but other times it fades away when an app brings delight to its users or solves a problem - it's a bit more humanizing and inspiring reply KeplerBoy 6 hours agorootparentSure, after all most of us work jobs to manipulate the number in a database that represents our account balance, but I don't want to do that in video games anymore.

I think Blizzard hasn't bothered going against the open source servers because even if there's just a 1% risk that a court would rule agains them, it would open the flood gates to much more professional teams to come in and do it because \"it's legal\". They do go against server operators sometimes, though they don't seem very determined there, and some servers have resisted successfully (hosting in Russia and identity hiding I think). I think they mostly use \"you're using copyrighted assets\" as a line of attack, precisely to avoid the risk that losing that would put them at risk. But IANAL. Also note that in both cases the projects need the assets from a real client and don't ship with them, expecting you to provide them. reply LinuxBender 7 hours agorootparentOut of curiosity have people figured out a way to extract detailed character data from the official WoW servers to import into their private servers as a starting point should the commercial servers some day not be viable for whatever reason? reply PeterStuer 7 hours agorootparentNot sure what you mean by \"detailed character data\"?

You could decompile the game client if you wanted to, but that's probably more trouble than it's worth in most cases. Most of the business logic is in the server anyway, the client is just to initiate actions and render the world state.

A recent experiment in a high school provides a cautionary tale. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that Turkish high school students who had access to ChatGPT while doing practice math problems did worse on a math test compared with students who didn’t have access to ChatGPT. Those with ChatGPT solved 48 percent more of the practice problems correctly, but they ultimately scored 17 percent worse on a test of the topic that the students were learning. Don't miss Proof Points Sign up to get alerted in your inbox when Jill Barshay's latest column publishes. Email(Required) A third group of students had access to a revised version of ChatGPT that functioned more like a tutor. This chatbot was programmed to provide hints without directly divulging the answer. The students who used it did spectacularly better on the practice problems, solving 127 percent more of them correctly compared with students who did their practice work without any high-tech aids. But on a test afterwards, these AI-tutored students did no better. Students who just did their practice problems the old fashioned way — on their own — matched their test scores. The researchers titled their paper, “Generative AI Can Harm Learning,” to make clear to parents and educators that the current crop of freely available AI chatbots can “substantially inhibit learning.” Even a fine-tuned version of ChatGPT designed to mimic a tutor doesn’t necessarily help. The researchers believe the problem is that students are using the chatbot as a “crutch.” When they analyzed the questions that students typed into ChatGPT, students often simply asked for the answer. Students were not building the skills that come from solving the problems themselves. ChatGPT’s errors also may have been a contributing factor. The chatbot only answered the math problems correctly half of the time. Its arithmetic computations were wrong 8 percent of the time, but the bigger problem was that its step-by-step approach for how to solve a problem was wrong 42 percent of the time.

Sign up A draft paper about the experiment was posted on the website of SSRN, formerly known as the Social Science Research Network, in July 2024. The paper has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal and could still be revised. This is just one experiment in another country, and more studies will be needed to confirm its findings. But this experiment was a large one, involving nearly a thousand students in grades nine through 11 during the fall of 2023. Teachers first reviewed a previously taught lesson with the whole classroom, and then their classrooms were randomly assigned to practice the math in one of three ways: with access to ChatGPT, with access to an AI tutor powered by ChatGPT or with no high-tech aids at all. Students in each grade were assigned the same practice problems with or without AI. Afterwards, they took a test to see how well they learned the concept. Researchers conducted four cycles of this, giving students four 90-minute sessions of practice time in four different math topics to understand whether AI tends to help, harm or do nothing. ChatGPT also seems to produce overconfidence. In surveys that accompanied the experiment, students said they did not think that ChatGPT caused them to learn less even though they had. Students with the AI tutor thought they had done significantly better on the test even though they did not. (It’s also another good reminder to all of us that our perceptions of how much we’ve learned are often wrong.) The authors likened the problem of learning with ChatGPT to autopilot. They recounted how an overreliance on autopilot led the Federal Aviation Administration to recommend that pilots minimize their use of this technology. Regulators wanted to make sure that pilots still know how to fly when autopilot fails to function correctly. ChatGPT is not the first technology to present a tradeoff in education. Typewriters and computers reduce the need for handwriting. Calculators reduce the need for arithmetic. When students have access to ChatGPT, they might answer more problems correctly, but learn less. Getting the right result to one problem won’t help them with the next one.

In life, we rarely have the answer in front of us, we have to work that out from the things we know. It’s this struggling that builds a muscle you can then apply to any problem. ChatGPT, I suspect, is akin to looking up the answer. You’re failing to exercise the muscle needed to solve novel (to you), problems. reply ShadowBlades512 14 hours agoparentI think this is very correct for studying, when I was in undergrad, if I saw the answer, I found it was more effective to skip past it and solve it later. Even more important, once I am done, I should not go look at the answer to confirm if I am right or wrong, I should try and validate the answer by looking at my solution and trying to figure out if my solution is correct or not because there are plenty of ways to \"disqualify\" an answer, once I learned to do this well, my grades really went up. However, I don't always agree with the fact that we don't have the answer in front of us in many situations. There are a lot of situations beyond grade school and undergrad where you do have the answer in front of you. Sometimes it's in for form of Numpy or Matlab or Simulink. It might be someone's research publication. Replicating these by working both forwards and backwards from their libraries or results can be much more effective. reply LeonB 13 hours agorootparentGood point about disproving your answer (before seeing the alleged real answer). The ability to quickly verify/disprove the answer is a separate and useful skill all by itself, that isn’t explicitly taught. Troubleshooting/problem solving, working backwards from symptom to problem etc — that’s another, richer and very rewarding “real world” type of skill that isn’t directly taught, (though often encountered incidentally). reply wongarsu 13 hours agorootparentprevHalf of modern mathematics is basically assuming something is true and then trying to work forwards and backwards to show that it is true. But that requires a lot of rigor. If you hand-wave a single step you are just exercising an advanced version of confirmation bias. Working forwards and sanity checking your result is a lot more forgiving. reply mym1990 14 hours agoparentprevI think it depends on how the tool is used. If a student is just plugging in the problem and asking for the answer, there is clearly no long term benefit to this. If the student is trying to understand a concept, and uses GPT to bounce ideas around or to ask for alternate ways of thinking about something, it can be very helpful. How spacing is utilized can be helpful too. Struggle with the problem for 20-30 minutes. Ask for a nudge. Struggle some more. Repeat many times. Some concepts also just have to be thought about differently to get to the aha moment, especially in math. AI may have an opportunity to present many instances of “think about it this way instead”. reply xigoi 53 minutes agorootparent> If the student is trying to understand a concept, and uses GPT to bounce ideas around or to ask for alternate ways of thinking about something, it can be very helpful.

If you decide at a young age it's worthless to attempt any problems that can be solved by a calculator or ChatGPT, you will probably never learn how to solve any problems that you can't use those tools for either. Also, knowing what kind of things exist and what questions to ask is half the battle. If you haven't stored anything in your head on the grounds that you can outsource knowing things and thinking about them to ChatGPT, you're not going to be able to prompt it efficiently either. It's much harder to sanity check numbers and formulas given to you by others (or ChatGPT) if you can't do any quick mental math. Having original ideas that don't yet exist in LLM datasets also requires storing a lot of concepts and making new connections between them. I suppose all this is moot if you expect AGI to be available to everyone in the near future, but if it turns out to be decades or more away unfortunately human mental effort will still be required in the meantime. reply wisty 13 hours agorootparentprevNot true. Current research is that experts are better with a ChatGTP, and beginners worse. An expert knows what to ask, and a beginner juat flails around. Tools like calculators, ChatGTP, Google, and chainsaws are often force magnifiers for experts, and a danger for beginners. If you have an idea of what you are trying to do at a deep level then they are great, but beginners don't, they usually just use them as a shortcut to avoid needing any real understanding of the space, and just get \"the answer\". Although in some ways youre right. There will need to be changes in the skills we value, just churning out words, or calculating large sums and interating obscure trig functions will lose value. reply ffsm8 12 hours agorootparent> Current research is that experts are better with a ChatGTP, and beginners worse. Current research being your opinion? Because literally every expert I personally know to be competent says that they're essentially garbage producers and don't use them beyond occasionally checking if they've improved. And no, they haven't. The only way to get decent code from them is to be so specific that you'd be able to produce the same code in a fraction of the time you need to add all the context necessary for the LLM to figure it out.

You’re not using it to be better than yourself though in your domain of expertise though. For example if I need a very specific bash script, I can describe it to ChatGPT and get a good result far faster than I can learn the appropriate bash.

On study problem sets (\"as a study assistant\"), kids with access to either GPT did better than control. When GPT access was subsequently removed from all participants (\"on tests\"), the kids who studied with \"GPT Base\" did worse than control. The kids with \"GPT Tutor\" were statistically indistinguishable from control. reply Jensson 11 hours agoparentChanging things almost always improves results, that is the first rule you need to remember during education testing. Most of the improvements disappear when you make it standard. This effect likely comes from novelty being more interesting so kids gets more alert, but when they are used to it then it is the same old boring thing and education results go back to normal. Of course things can improve or get worse, but in general it is really hard to say, you need to have a massive advantage over the standard during testing to actually get any real improvements, most of the time you just make things worse. reply blitzar 10 hours agoparentprevAssuming that the kids with \"Human Tutor\" were statistically better than control (they were not in the study so we will not know) - this is a very poor showing for ChatGPT. reply lyu07282 12 hours agoparentprevReading comprehension is really awful nowadays or people tend to just comprehend what confirms their prior beliefs.

That's exactly one of the mechanisms how people form wrong opinions, it's compounding and almost impossible to change. The takeaway should be (besides the research still needing reproduction) to encourage the control of the type of AI agent that is given to students, ones that don't just give answers to copy but provide tutoring. OpenAI should be forced to develop such a \"student mode\" immediately and parents and educators need to be made aware of it to make sure students are using it, otherwise students are going to get much worse in tests, as they just ask it for answers to copy in assignments. reply dghlsakjg 14 hours agoprevUsed incorrectly.

In the same way, I can hire a tutor that will help me actually learn, or I can hire a “tutor” that just does the homework for me.

For a recent example where I am learning about deep learning: In what circumstances is MSE a useful loss function for regression? This is not a hard question to answer from a variety of resources, but I find it particularly useful to have my question answered differently instead of having to sort through a variety of resources.

However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17% reduction for GPT Base).” Kids who use ChatGPT do actually “significantly” better according to the authors. Now I don’t know if significantly means statistically significant here because I haven’t read the methodology but 127% increase in performance must be something. That said, that’s a clickbaity title if I’ve ever seen one. Edit: Upon closer reading, the increase in performance is statistically significant. Also “access to GPT“ in this case is having GPT open while solving the problems, not studying with GPT and then solving the problems, which was my first understanding from the clickbaity title. Results are not terribly surprising in that regard. reply Jtsummers 14 hours agoparent> Also “access to GPT“ in this case is having GPT open while solving the problems, not studying with GPT and then taking the test If this is your takeaway you misread the paper. Students have access to GPT (if they have access, the control didn't) while working through practice problems. Not for the exam itself. From the paper in the experimental design section: > Each session has three parts: > 1. In the first part, teachers review a topic (e.g., combinatorics) previously covered in the course, and solve one or more examples on the board. This part is identical to a standard high school one-to-many (i.e., teacher-to-students) lecture. > 2. The second part is an assisted practice period, where students solve a sequence of exercises designed by teachers to reinforce the covered concept. Our randomized intervention (described in more detail below) only affects this second, self-study part. > 3. The third part is an unassisted evaluation, where students take a closed-book, closed laptop exam. Importantly, each problem in the exam corresponds to a conceptually very similar practice problem from the previous part—this design was chosen to help students practice the key concepts needed to perform well on the exam. Students with GPT (either form) did better during the practice problem portion and then worse during the actual exam (without GPT access) than students in the control. reply madhatter999 13 hours agorootparentThanks for the clarification. I did look at it pretty quickly initially. Students might be over-relying on GPTs, which means less studying, which means less useful retention in the exam reply alabhyajindal 14 hours agoparentprevThey don't do better as far as learning is concerned. Isn't this concerning? > However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17% reduction for GPT Base).

Our results suggest that students attempt to use GPT-4 as a \"crutch\" during practice problem sessions, and when successful, perform worse on their own. Thus, to maintain long-term productivity, we must be cautious when deploying generative AI to ensure humans continue to learn critical skills. reply madhatter999 14 hours agorootparentRelying on GPT while solving the problems must be inflating the grades (my use of the word inflate is intentional, because the evaluation does not represent the true knowledge of the student), which then results in lower retention in the long run. reply bufferoverflow 3 hours agoparentprev> Kids who use ChatGPT do actually “significantly” better according to the authors No, ChatGPT does significantly better than the kids who don't have access to ChatGPT.

I was panicked, and initially struggled until one of my good friends who was also studying the same course, and is VERY good at math, was able to answer my vague \"I don't get it\" questions, or at least guide me to more specific questions. I think I'm quite a visual learner, I don't think at that time there was a concept of people learning \"differently\". Luckily my good friend was also a visual learner, along with also being very good at math. It was like someone was able to see how my brain worked and feed me information in a way it could compile. I became quite good at math after that. You really need to learn how to learn. Its fascinating, but also horrifying when I now consider all the lives that have been negatively impacted because this wasn't understood, and people were led to believe they couldn't do something which maybe then really wanted to be able to do.

I really believe most people don't learn math because they don't get the teaching they need, not because math is somehow cognitively inaccessible for them (except in case of low iq). Lots of people learn language and grammar and are able to write strong texts with a high level of rational and logical thinking, but have not been able to learn math. These people clearly have the mental faculties for math, they just didn't get the teaching they needed. Math is a language for expressing thought, just like any language is, and these people have mastered other languages, so they have the prerequisites for being able to learn the language of math.

After all, a measuring tape is just a few flexible metersticks anyways, so if you need to measure something longer than the full length of the tape, you are screwed. If you take the measuring tape away from the person who relied on that tool instead of being good at using a meterstick, or perhaps no tools besides their own arm length, they are gonna suddenly not be able to measure, unless they go through the effort of learning to measure without the tape. You can argue that measuring tape is a crutch preventing people from learning how to properly measure, and has its own limitations, but regardless its still really helpful, especially for people who only need to measure things occassionally, and not super long things.

I have seen people use calculators to chug \"6-2\" before, and they were not children. In fact, all four of those examples are perfect for my point. They create the opportunity to do great things, or be a crutch so you don't have to think. If you are convinsed that there is no user of grammarly that didn't just quickly type a draft and throw it in without proofreading, for the sake of not needing to use basic grammatical reasoning, then you have a very kind view of mankind. > I'm talking about bringing together several independent concepts or sets of facts and forming a coherent point of view or argument from them. This is a more narrow view than what I was arguing, so it's possible we will have to agree to disagree. I guess a quick rebuttle here is that people who don't exercise sufficient thought to form coherent conclusions from separate information were going to stay stupid anyway.

I learned programming thru a text editor vim. I didn’t have autocomplete and LSPs wouldn’t be invented until 8 years later. I wasn’t smart enough to figure out how to install/setup omnicomplete or snippets. All this meant I had to seek out the docs every time I wanted to use a method (or even be aware of an API), I had to write the same method every time. I’d like to think this paid off for me, when writing JS I have a good heuristic on what methods do what that was slowly developed over constant repetition. Now that I’m mentoring others I notice how others work with these modern editor features. It’s certainly faster than how I did it but I do wonder if there is a difference in aptitude. When I worked at my first large corporation there was a very intelligent dev. I noticed over time he never really looked up answers on stack overflow or random blogs. He always went straight to the docs and the source code itself. I like to think his method of deliberate slowdown has paid off massively, even the way he asks questions was better than the rest of us. It is hard to know which ways are better for learning and in the end we were all roughly making the same amount but there has to be something more to the usual pedagogy for software engineering. I do wonder if tools like autocomplete, myriad of internet answers or musings, and now LLMs may be a hindrance for initial learning but it’s always hard to make these arguments because we have the benefit of learned experience whereas the new generation are now using different tools than us yet still arrive at the same conclusions. reply dools 14 hours agoparentprevI can report that I have learned more about bash scripting in the past couple of years using ChatGPT to write all manner of scripts, than I did in the previous 20 years of copying and pasting things off StackOverflow. reply JTyQZSnP3cQGa8B 14 hours agorootparentYou’re supposed to learn by reading books and doing exercises by yourself (https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/).

Unlike SO, I can ask it why it is doing something and as a result I can better understand what it writes, I can create little test cases, and make sure it's not going to do anything destructive or incorrect. Given the fact that I only ever write bash scripts when I need to \"make computer do thing now now now now now\" the likelihood that I would ever take the time to deeply learn the ins and outs of bash are slim to none. I can ask it to explain certain constructs and give me worked examples very quickly to improve my understanding. Even though I can't say I could reproduce all the various things that it has written for me, I know things that bash can do that I was never aware of before, and I can recognise lots of things in the syntax now that would previously have looked like gibberish. reply kamaal 6 hours agorootparentprevThe difference is you can't query or chat with a book.

Kids using \"base\" GPT4 performed poorly but the ones with access to a finely-tuned \"tutor\" GPT4 did okay. The study was purposefully done in a domain the current SoTA LLMs struggle in (Math). From the (draft!) paper's abstract: A key remaining question is how generative AI affects learning, namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform tasks. This kind of skill learning is critical to long-term productivity gains, especially in domains where generative AI is fallible and human experts must check its outputs. .. Consistent with prior work, our results show that access to GPT-4 significantly improves performance (48% improvement for GPT Base and 127% for GPT Tutor). However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17% reduction for GPT Base). That is, access to GPT-4 can harm educational outcomes. These negative learning effects are largely mitigated by the safeguards included in GPT Tutor. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4895486 reply tripletao 13 hours agoparentTo emphasize, the \"GPT Tutor\" kids didn't do worse on the exam than the control kids, but they didn't do better either. The effect was slightly negative, statistically insignificant: > Student performance in the GPT Tutor cohort was statistically indistinguishable from that of the control cohort, and the point estimate was smaller by an order of magnitude (-0.004), suggesting minimal impact to performance in the unassisted exam. \"GPT Base\" would provide complete answers, but \"GPT Tutor\" was prompted to provide only hints. So the result is perhaps that: 1. Given the option to let a machine (\"GPT Base\") do their homework, many kids will lazily take it. These kids won't learn as much. 2. A machine that refuses to do their homework (\"GPT Tutor\") doesn't cause that problem. It doesn't seem to help either, though. I'd guess that laziness would explain most of the harm rather than mistakes made by \"GPT Base\", though I have no particular evidence for that. Maybe someone will repeat this study in a domain where \"GPT Base\" makes fewer mistakes, allowing those two effects to be distinguished.

Worse, it's convincing, so be careful. LLMs are great for finding key words in a domain you don't know which you can then use to search. As a mostly self taught programmer the advice I'll give it to read docs and learn to read code. This is when my skills really increased. It's easy to get caught up in trying to just find the answer and doing these things definitely takes longer. But it has a multiplicative effect. You'll not only learn to be able to do it faster but you'll need to do it less often. So never pass up the opportunity to learn. There are times you need to rush but they're far less often than you think. The other big advice I have is two strategies when coding. First write it quick and fast. Sloppy is okay, you're learning to solve the problem (move fast and break things). Then while you're cleaning up the mess you made, document. While you're doing that it'll stress the lessons into your memory and you'll almost always discovery things you missed. It is literally the rubber ducky method. Plus, you get the benefit of docs (others will read your code. And months or years later you'll come back, asking what idiot wrote this garbage to only find it's you. But also, that's a good sign, because you improved!). The second point is that the best code is flexible code. Remember that you suck at code (the secret is we all do) and you're going to have to come back, edit, and debug. So by writing flexible code you're making life easier for future you. It's really easy to forget these lessons because we think in the moment and our egos don't want us to admit we're bumbling idiots, but like in a video game, when it gets harder it means you're progressing. Don't misinterpret that signal. reply alabhyajindal 10 hours agorootparentThanks for the advice! > As a mostly self taught programmer the advice I'll give it to read docs and learn to read code.

When I was a kid my high school math class was very calculator driven. I have a lot to say about that, but won’t bore you with it. I would often see adults pull out a pencil and paper and do a whole bunch of math very quickly, or do a lot of math quickly in their head. I couldn’t do this as well as them, and my math classes weren’t doing anything to move me in that direction. When the calculators were taken away, most of the kids were useless. I saw a guy in National Math Honor Society put 1-1 in his calculator, unironically. This was almost 25 years ago. I assume it’s only gotten worse, and will continue to get worse as more tools that provide answers are given to the students. I think new tools are great, but it seems to me that the people who can utilize them the best are the ones who learned without them. Those are the people who understand the concepts behind them, so they can ask the right questions, with the right terminology, and they can recognize if an answer makes sense. When learning is done with these tools, even just calculators, little is being learned. Memorize the button sequence to press leading up to the test. Once the test is over, forget the sequence… and even if the buttons are relented, it won’t matter, because while we all walk around with a calculator in our pockets now, it’s not a TI-83 (or whatever people use now), so without the conceptual knowledge, what good is the button sequence.

Critical thinking and problem solving skills have always been an absolute bear to teach, and few teachers or school systems have the stomach to teach it. I’m thinking of science education, for example. It’s not just a matter of teaching kids a bunch of disconnected facts about science like “the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell” but teaching kids to use the scientific method. To teach the scientific method well, you have to get the kids to design experiments and be comfortable with the prospect of failure. This is, sadly, a very modern approach and requires training the teachers how to do this. Some schools don’t but it’s not something you would have likely gotten much of in the 20th century.

But many comments are not responding to the article content reply godelski 13 hours agoparentI think the part of overconfidence is actually important here. Looking at the paper Figure 2 shows the number of questions. For all sessions with GPT students averaged 2 messages per problem. Interestingly 20% isn't restating the problem or asking for the answer. Looks like 50-60% of tutor questions are asking for answer or restating problem and they ask more questions. In my experience, usually where GPT and other LLMs get things wrong is in the steps. I see people are frequently over confident about the results and I've long thought this was a big part of it that the answer may be right but steps to get there are wrong. I see this a lot with river crossing problems. People will often show a prompt that solves it (half the time there's information leakage) and a good portion of those will have the logic errors. But people just look at the answer (btw, this is the reason I claim LLMs don't reason. It's not about getting the answer wrong, it's about the logical steps. That's the real evaluation!) Personally I think this is good evidence of over fitting (memorization). I also think this is why you should be careful when using it to code. It's the details that matter a lot. Since LLMs are aggregators I'd like to remind everyone that the average coder and average code is terrible. Hell, even good programmers often suck. Code is hard! Whenever I try using LLMs to code I find that I write lines faster but I end up spending more time debugging and prompt engineering than if I just read the docs and did it myself (this also has the added benefit of the struggle making me remember more). So I'll use it to write things I don't really care about but otherwise I'm not getting how people are finding it so helpful (yes, I read my comment).

The delta time needs to be measured. - using VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR or VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR force vsync, but vsync can be anything. With the physics system being locked to 60, you'll notice a stutter on non-mulitiple vsyncs like 144hz. There aren't many solutions I know for this, but the main ones I know of are interpolation and extrapolation of the physics state based on the framerate. I would bump the physics update rate to 120hz to match rocket league and then experiment from there. - Using both Eigen and GLM is overkill in this case, both are slow, but if sticking with one I would use switch solely glm. - More of a nitpick, but I would separate out all the code at least between rendering and physics to their own independent files. The vulkan api on it's own adds a lot of clutter, moving that to it's own file should make the project easier to navigate and explorer. There are more things, like how hard coded that shaders are, but I assume the vulkan renderer will be improved past just being from the vulkan-tutorial, so advice for that can't really be given till the renderer has been updated. P.S. Sorry if any of this sounds harsh, it's not my intention. I've just done a lot of work involving games, game engines and renderers. And I'm seeing a lot of the problems I made when I first started. I wish you the best of luck with your project. reply molli 2 hours agoparentThanks a lot for the feedback! I built it in ~2 weeks and it's really just a prototype at this stage. Some of the points I did on purpose to finish a prototype quickly (Eigen + GLM, one file, not syncing renderer and physics, hardcoding shaders etc.). But some things I didn't know - thanks for that :) reply molli 4 hours agoprevI've created a Discord server for Hacker League: https://discord.gg/BbNH27st. Everyone is welcome! I'll also keep building in public on X: https://x.com/moritzthuening. I love you all. reply karaterobot 3 hours agoprevI played so much Rocket League before it went free-to-play. Seeing this repo made me watch some youtube videos, and remember what a great game it is. It's been tweaked and polished until it feels perfect. I think getting an open source version of the game to that level would require a lot of work, so I wish you well. reply JohnMakin 2 hours agoparentIt's a great game - unfortunately the insane and obnoxious way they do ranked ladder means the experience is often miserable if you want to play competitively. reply samtheprogram 2 hours agorootparent> way they do ranked ladder Could you elaborate? I play the game, but I don’t play much of anything else with ranks so I’m curious what ladder means here and the alternative examples. reply JohnMakin 1 hour agorootparentI could write an essay on this (played since 2015) so I'm sorry if this is overly wordy and I hope it makes sense. A long time ago they had a pretty basic MMR/matchmaking system that was being gamed pretty badly by smurfs. So, in an attempt to deal with smurfs, Epic made a really opaque blackbox \"internal\" MMR, that determines what kind of teammates you get. The reason this exists is because everyone tends to get lumped into \"chokepoint\" ranks - Diamond 3/low champ, C3/GC, and from there I think there's another one closer to SSL but I've only been a GC1 before so I can't comment on that experience. The reason for this is you can have a 60+% winrate in diamond and never leave diamond. That results in tons of players being in a rank they clearly do not belong in - very ironically creating an unintentional smurf problem they were trying to addresss in the first place - and this is exacerbated by a draconian rank decay/reset every season which only lasts a quarter. So, it's not entirely uncommon to see players with a GC tournament tag from the previous season (means they won a GC tournament, which means they almost certainly are SSL players) in low champ or even diamond. This is made even WORSE by the way that placement games work every season - pros have worked out it's almost always better to just sit out the first few weeks of a season before doing your placements, because you may accidentally get a really high \"internal\" mmr (the only purpose of these placements) by beating other smurfs in a low rank ladder. As a result, epic has tried to balance this idiotic mess by pairing these types of players with lower \"true\" ranks. So, often when I am in high diamond/low champ I will have a literal carried platinum player with me every single time against another team with a guy who also has a higher \"true\" MMR and whatever \"low\" MMR player the matchmaking has decided he also gets paired with. I solo queue though, so this effect is basically a miserable experience trying to climb, as it's much more difficult for me to climb out of a low rank than other players closer to their \"true\" rank. And I have to repeat this process every 12 fucking weeks. when I play casual, within 10 games the matchmaking immediately puts me in high champ lobbies. So, they know how to match make fairly, clearly - there's simply no mechanism in ranked to quickly rank someone up who very obviously should not be in the rank. It should not be possible to win 15 games in a row and stay in the same rank - every other game addresses this by quickly ranking up people on win streaks. For whatever reason, epic does not, and for this reason and all of what I listed above, the experience is absolutely miserable. reply batch12 1 hour agorootparentIf it helps anyone else- The term 'smurf' is used in gaming to describe a player in an online game that creates a new account to play against lower-ranked players, however, it can be used as an all-around term for describing a player who uses an alternate account or multiple accounts. Matchmaking Rating (MMR) reply stackghost 46 minutes agorootparentPretty sure that \"Smurf\" originated with the Tribes series, as you could create alias nicknames/accounts that showed up as blue in the player list. Or at least, that's the first time I encountered the term. reply Cpoll 21 minutes agorootparentThe etymology I've heard is that it comes from Warcraft 2, where some top players made Smurf-themed alt-accounts after everyone started dodging them. That may be apocryphal. reply JohnMakin 1 hour agorootparentprevyea, sorry, these are common terms in that community I didn't explain, thank you.

The ability of game developers to leverage licensing, contracts with orgs, etc. to lock down a competitive ecosystem with exclusivity results in inability for a \"free market\" to develop around running events and broadcasts. Rocket League and League of Legends come to mind here, where the competitive scene is almost exclusively eSports content produced by the developer itself and doing all sorts of tricks to establish lock-in. If we look at how traditional sports work, it's much more organic. Leagues have the ability to negotiate their own game rules, TV rights, oversight, and more. Leagues compete with each other for viewership, because viewers naturally want to watch the best games (or their local games) and viewership drives revenue via sponsorships and TV licensing. Game developer lock-in prevents this economy from developing, prevents the competitive nature of leagues from working on improving the game from a viewership perspective, and the closed-source nature of the game prevents the game from being able to \"move on\" from bad rules, bad communities, bad design, etc. Many (most? all?) of these online competitive games have toxic online communities and in-game interactions. The game developers don't have the money to develop exhaustive anti-abuse mechanisms, or to pay a large support staff to sift through reports, so lots of times the best you get is a simple heuristic. And these companies are not financially incentivized to ban bad actors. In fact, they're incentivized to ban _as few as possible_ without damaging the player base. Players will quit over toxic interactions and cheaters, but cheaters and toxic players can also be the most reliable spenders in a game, so there's to reason to ban any more of them than absolutely necessary. But with an open-source game, communities can self-organize and self-moderate. If I play on a local soccer team and they're all racist or homophobic, I'll find a new team or a new league. But at present there's no \"find a new Rocket League\". So I think open-source games will have a big impact on the competitive online game industry. I think the resulting ecosystem has a lot more sustainability and player stickiness than current games do in light of the aforementioned toxicity and anti-competitive patterns, so there is much more money to be made than game developers are making currently. reply bogwog 3 hours agoparentAlternatively, the \"sport\" in esports is the genre (FPS, Moba, Fighting, etc), and the \"leagues\" are the individual games. Yes, the specific rules and mechanics of each game are vastly different even within the same genre, and strategies will be different, but skills like leadership, reaction time, hand-eye-coordination, etc will be used similarly across all games. Even with an open source game, it's likely each league will want to make changes to the base game anyways. Maybe an open source game could work for smaller \"leagues\" that don't have the resources to develop an entire game from scratch (and assuming there's even a demand for a small league like that), but even then forking/building atop an open source game is still a lot more work than just using an existing commercial game that has more flexible multiplayer options (and so long as there aren't licensing issues) reply busterarm 4 hours agoparentprevHard disagree. With the exception of 1v1 fighting games, centralized/official servers are _required_ for esports to even work. Peer-to-peer communication models and self-hosted client-server games both are filled with cheaters. How would players ever feel comfortable competing on community/self-hosted server? \"Esports\" games require absolutely massive communities (e.g., marketing) and no open-source game has even come close to the scale required to sustain an esport. reply JasonSage 3 hours agorootparentI think you’re conflating unrelated things Servers can be community-run and centralized per league/community. See TF2 (more decentralized) and FaceIt (Counter-Strike) for examples of self-moderating communities than can exist outside of the developer-centralized model. At no point do I assume P2P to be a requirement or even beneficial in this scenario. reply busterarm 3 hours agorootparentTF2 is overrun with bots right now to the point that the game is unplayable and the surviving community has been screaming at Valve about this for years. As for FaceIt, that came about from the existing CS community. After 15+ years of the game being out. You can't just build something like that in a vacuum. The whole point is that \"esports\" depends on centralized servers and somebody footing the bill for that. Even in fighting games that are P2P, there's still the matchmaking lobbies. And you could say \"well, there's FightCade!\"...but a) that's illegal and b) I've never seen more than 150 people in a FightCade lobby and it's usually around 10-30. Esports games have > 10^4 concurrent players. reply JasonSage 3 hours agorootparentI’m optimistic that as the opportunities come along, players will take them. Your argument sounds to me analogous to “everybody will just use Twitter/X because why would somebody want to pay to host a Mastodon instance with no participants.” The reality is that some (but not all) people do genuinely have grief with the centralized platform (moderation, censorship, toxicity), do have the ability to pay for something better (or freeload off people who do care), and are thus willing to make a change with there’s sufficiently low resistance. The reason this is possible at all is because people that did care in a very small minority made the decentralized platform for free while everybody else was oblivious. It doesn’t get built overnight and usage doesn’t convert overnight, but when the solution exists it can then be viable. I do think open source games are a fair ways off, but I find it impossible to believe that people will work for decades for free on open source social media because they enjoy it, but the same will never be true of games. It’s an eventuality, and it is one that changes dynamics for the end-consumer. reply JasonSage 2 hours agorootparentprev> TF2 is overrun with bots right now to the point that the game is unplayable and the surviving community has been screaming at Valve about this for years. Perfect example. With the existence of a sufficiently-close open-source base, the community would have self-organized TF2 out of existence with a functional replacement. This just isn’t possible today, but when it is possible there will be no turning back. reply molli 3 hours agorootparentprevWhen a game is not popular anymore some developers just turn off their servers destroying the multiplayer. That won't happen with decentralized open source servers. reply lupusreal 2 hours agorootparentprev> \"Esports\" games require absolutely massive communities (e.g., marketing) and no open-source game has even come close to the scale required to sustain an esport. If by \"sustain an esport\" you mean as a profitable enterprise, then probably not. Is that the best metric though? Open source games can become popular enough for competitive scenes to emerge; Warsow is an example of this. Popular enough for competitive play but not enough to get corporate sponsors seems fine to me. It's probably not healthy to be promoting the idea (to kids particularly) that playing video games can be a profitable career. reply busterarm 30 minutes agorootparentNo I mean \"sustain an esport\" the same as I would mean \"sustain a sport\". For it to be an actual contest it needs an actual sample size of players. Sports need spectators and narratives that generate interest. Nobody gives a damn about Warsow the same way nobody gave a damn about Ferret-Legging. It's not a sport if its players are limited to \"you and your mates from round the way\", that's just a game. Sports are meant to expose the limits of human potential. reply tylerflick 4 hours agoparentprev> The game developers don't have the money to develop exhaustive anti-abuse mechanisms, or to pay a large support staff to sift through reports, so lots of times the best you get is a simple heuristic. And these companies are not financially incentivized to ban bad actors. In fact, they're incentivized to ban _as few as possible_ without damaging the player base. I can promise you this is not true. Major publishers absolutely try to curb toxic behavior and are heavily invested in doing so. reply JasonSage 3 hours agorootparentI’m interested in learning more about this. Obviously this is something I care about and want to be well-read in when presenting a case. I do know in League of Legends that there’s a lot more care and attention put into it, and frankly I suspect that it’s because they have the money to do so and because they care deeply about the game still being relevant in 1 & 2 decades from now. The same can be said of Fortnite, possibly because of their closer integration with app stores as well and the sensitivity of having a younger audience. Anecdotally, I think it can’t be said of Rocket League at all. It seems strongly to be profit-driven and moderation-light, and I think most games that size and smaller are operating the same way. I’d love to hear where/why I’m wrong and what public information there is on the subject. reply SkiFire13 1 hour agorootparentRocket League has been declining since Epic Games bought them. reply molli 3 hours agoparentprevSome very interesting thoughts here. Imo open source software is mostly higher quality than proprietary one. And apparently the industry is not so interested in Linux. Proton from Valve is interesting but crashes on my machine all the time. So I guess we have to build ourselves and have some fun in the process. reply fwip 4 hours agoparentprevI don't think \"open-source\" means much of anything here. You can freely copy game design and make your own knockoffs. That's why half of the video gaming market is Doom-derived. Anybody can make a football league, and anyone can make a MOBA. But to make the next League of Legends or the NFL, you need a ton of marketing money, and you need to pay to attract the top player talent. The actual money you pay the developers is not the lion's share of the spend. By the reports I can find, Overwatch cost about $50M to make, but they spent over $900M on advertising/marketing/tournaments/etc. reply JasonSage 3 hours agorootparentOpen source means everything here. Let’s say that you want to be a tournament organizer and do tournament streams of an esport. You are going to use sponsorships and ad revenue to drive your profit, and you have a sponsor providing the prize pool. You won’t be able to feature current league teams that are contractually obligated to participate in developer-endorsed events only, because the developer has all the leverage in being able to provide a larger prize pool for their official championship league (that is marketing budget for their game, funded by the game itself), so esports organizations are going to be locked-in to that contract. The barrier to entry for you as an organizer is now to either pay a licensing fee to the developer for the privilege of being endorsed and allowing their contracted organizations to participate, which has a huge impact on your profitability… or to make your own fucking video game. The open source aspect gives you: - an existing player base - ability to provide your own game rules - ability to use exclusive visuals/assets - ability to avoid licensing fees destroying your profitability And if your organization goes under, the game lives on. If another organization goes under, you have opportunities to capture more of your market. You have the ability to improve your viewership by funding improvement of the game. And, by the way, if you suck, somebody who can do it better will come along and take your money, which is actually good for the viewer and the player, which is much better than the way current games/leagues deteriorate. reply shard972 4 hours agoparentprevwhen esports mostly exists as a loss leader to sell video games I don't quite see this vision anytime soon. reply mh- 4 hours agorootparentI get your point, but I'm not sure loss leader is quite the way to describe it. I think of it as a marketing/promo expense like any other. Are user conferences loss leaders? Also, RL is free-to-play nowadays.

However, Rocket League is one game that I just can't master. I've tried, really really tried, but I just can't play it with any amount of skill.

I can't really explain why, but my brain just doesn't mesh with it, skill-wise. It's still a lot of fun though (otherwise I wouldn't have spent so long playing it!). In fact, being so bad at it somehow made it more enjoyable - it's not often I allow myself to be bad at something. I'd rank myself as \"unusually good\" at Mario Kart, which is obviously a very different game, but it surprises me that I have such a wide skill gap between the two games. reply aliasxneo 4 hours agorootparentprevI'm decent at Rocket League and sit between Plat III and Diamond I.

To me, a 40 year old playing with KBM, I feel like I just can't bend my brain around all of the 3d possibilities. I just don't have any intuition for rolling my car while it accelerates towards the front...and then you add in the complexity of the camera and, yeah, I suck. reply vonunov 3 hours agorootparentPart of the problem is rolling vs. yawing. Most players have something along the lines of LB mapped to powerslide + air roll. So when flying, they have to think (actively or otherwise) about when to roll vs. when to release LB so that the left stick X axis will yaw instead. This is, in my experience, very difficult to actually do. There's a control config I tried and greatly enjoyed that addresses this. I want to get back into it but I haven't yet felt like dealing with the adjustment period again. This works best if you have a controller with mappable paddles. Left stick X: Ground steer and air steer (yaw) Left stick Y: Pitch Right stick X: Air roll Right stick Y: Ground throttle And then jump/boost/powerslide go on triggers/bumpers/paddles as desired. Being able to simultaneously yaw and roll feels quite nice once you get used to it and allows for some surprisingly intuitive recoveries, wall jumps, etc. \"Tornado spinning\" is now as simple as pushing the sticks in opposite directions. Other interesting results can be had from the various other combinations of stick directions. This does require you to no longer use the button pad for anything, so if you use ballcam toggle while playing, or need to peek at the scoreboard a lot, or need a thumb free for real-time quickchats, or whatever, then I hope you have a lot of extra paddles reply walr000s 1 hour agorootparentAnother reason to envy controller players.

None of the camera settings feel \"right\". reply vonunov 2 hours agorootparentIt takes some playing around with and is highly subjective. Best method I found was to just try camera configs used by pros or recommended by others and see what feels good. My current: Shake: off FOV: 110 Distance: 280 Height: 110 Angle: -3.00 Stiffness: 0.75 The rest aren't relevant for me because swivel speed is about looking with the right stick and transition speed is about switching to/from ball cam, and I leave ball cam on. Of these, I believe the most important (by which I mean tangibly relevant to control quality/feel) are distance, stiffness, and, to some degree, height+angle. Shake and FOV are also important, but those are the only good values for those settings. I used to play with max distance because it felt better for visibility, but I found some people saying 270/280 works much better for them for precise ball control and accurate strikes, and that does seem to be the case. Stiffness is the other setting that will make the most difference in feel: Lower values let the camera's distance from your car rubber-band further in relation to your speed. It might seem as if maxing this out would be ideal, because why wouldn't you want the camera to follow your movement as closely as possible, and why would you want the camera to lag behind you when you go faster and disorient you when you're trying to aerial? But I'm not so sure. I've tried stiffness at 1 (max) and I don't remember why, but apparently it didn't work for me, because I lowered it to 0.75, which I guess I found acceptable enough not to have changed it. I've just come across some people saying a stiffness of around 0.35 is counterintuitively great as it turns out that moving the car without instantly moving the camera helps a lot with car control for some reason, so I'm about to test run that value myself and see about it. reply walr000s 1 hour agorootparentprevI highly recommend turning ball cam off once you get close to the ball. reply molli 2 hours agoparentprevMaybe you will be good at Hacker League:) reply superkuh 5 hours agoprevnext [6 more] [flagged] verandaguy 5 hours agoparentWhy on earth would an open source Rocket League made by an unrelated-to-Epic author be responsible for mitigating some bad actions by Epic? reply superkuh 4 hours agorootparentnext [5 more] [flagged] verandaguy 4 hours agorootparentRight, but who’s trying to mitigate Epic’s actions?

Dedication For Feòrag, with love Acknowledgements This book took me five years to write – a personal record – and would not exist without the support and encouragement of a host of friends, and several friendly editors. Among the many people who read and commented on the early drafts are: Andrew J. Wilson, Stef Pearson, Gav Inglis, Andrew Ferguson, Jack Deighton, Jane McKie, Hannu Rajaniemi, Martin Page, Stephen Christian, Simon Bisson, Paul Fraser, Dave Clements, Ken MacLeod, Damien Broderick, Damon Sicore, Cory Doctorow, Emmet O'Brien, Andrew Ducker, Warren Ellis, and Peter Hollo. (If your name isn't on this list, blame my memory – my neural prostheses are off-line.) I mentioned several friendly editors earlier: I relied on the talented midwifery of Gardner Dozois, who edited Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine at the time, and Sheila Williams, who quietly and diligently kept the wheels rolling. My agent Caitlin Blasdell had a hand in it too, and I'd like to thank my editors Ginjer Buchanan at Ace and Tim Holman at Orbit for their helpful comments and advice. Finally, I'd like to thank everyone who e-mailed me to ask when the book was coming, or who voted for the stories that were shortlisted for awards. You did a great job of keeping me focused, even during the periods when the whole project was too daunting to contemplate. Publication History Portions of this book originally appeared in Asimov's SF Magazine as follows: \"Lobsters\" (June 2001), \"Troubadour\" (Oct/Nov 2001), \"Tourist\" (Feb 2002), \"Halo\" (June 2002), \"Router\" (Sept 2002), \"Nightfall\" (April 2003), \"Curator\" (Dec 2003), \"Elector\" (Oct/Nov 2004), \"Survivor\" (Dec 2004). Contents Part 1: Slow Takeoff Lobsters Troubadour Tourist Part 2: Point of Inflection Halo Router Nightfall Part 3: Singularity Curator Elector Survivor PART 1: Slow Takeoff \"The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim.\" – Edsger W. Dijkstra Chapter 1: Lobsters Manfred's on the road again, making strangers rich. It's a hot summer Tuesday, and he's standing in the plaza in front of the Centraal Station with his eyeballs powered up and the sunlight jangling off the canal, motor scooters and kamikaze cyclists whizzing past and tourists chattering on every side. The square smells of water and dirt and hot metal and the fart-laden exhaust fumes of cold catalytic converters; the bells of trams ding in the background, and birds flock overhead. He glances up and grabs a pigeon, crops the shot, and squirts it at his weblog to show he's arrived. The bandwidth is good here, he realizes; and it's not just the bandwidth, it's the whole scene. Amsterdam is making him feel wanted already, even though he's fresh off the train from Schiphol: He's infected with the dynamic optimism of another time zone, another city. If the mood holds, someone out there is going to become very rich indeed. He wonders who it's going to be. * * * Manfred sits on a stool out in the car park at the Brouwerij 't IJ, watching the articulated buses go by and drinking a third of a liter of lip-curlingly sour gueuze. His channels are jabbering away in a corner of his head-up display, throwing compressed infobursts of filtered press releases at him. They compete for his attention, bickering and rudely waving in front of the scenery. A couple of punks – maybe local, but more likely drifters lured to Amsterdam by the magnetic field of tolerance the Dutch beam across Europe like a pulsar – are laughing and chatting by a couple of battered mopeds in the far corner. A tourist boat putters by in the canal; the sails of the huge windmill overhead cast long, cool shadows across the road. The windmill is a machine for lifting water, turning wind power into dry land: trading energy for space, sixteenth-century style. Manfred is waiting for an invite to a party where he's going to meet a man he can talk to about trading energy for space, twenty-first-century style, and forget about his personal problems. He's ignoring the instant messenger boxes, enjoying some low-bandwidth, high-sensation time with his beer and the pigeons, when a woman walks up to him, and says his name: \"Manfred Macx?\" He glances up. The courier is an Effective Cyclist, all wind-burned smooth-running muscles clad in a paean to polymer technology: electric blue lycra and wasp yellow carbonate with a light speckling of anti collision LEDs and tight-packed air bags. She holds out a box for him. He pauses a moment, struck by the degree to which she resembles Pam, his ex-fiance. \"I'm Macx,\" he says, waving the back of his left wrist under her bar-code reader. \"Who's it from?\" \"FedEx.\" The voice isn't Pam's. She dumps the box in his lap, then she's back over the low wall and onto her bicycle with her phone already chirping, disappearing in a cloud of spread-spectrum emissions. Manfred turns the box over in his hands: it's a disposable supermarket phone, paid for in cash – cheap, untraceable, and efficient. It can even do conference calls, which makes it the tool of choice for spooks and grifters everywhere. The box rings. Manfred rips the cover open and pulls out the phone, mildly annoyed. \"Yes? Who is this?\" The voice at the other end has a heavy Russian accent, almost a parody in this decade of cheap on-line translation services. \"Manfred. Am please to meet you. Wish to personalize interface, make friends, no? Have much to offer.\" \"Who are you?\" Manfred repeats suspiciously. \"Am organization formerly known as KGB dot RU.\" \"I think your translator's broken.\" He holds the phone to his ear carefully, as if it's made of smoke-thin aerogel, tenuous as the sanity of the being on the other end of the line. \"Nyet – no, sorry. Am apologize for we not use commercial translation software. Interpreters are ideologically suspect, mostly have capitalist semiotics and pay-per-use APIs. Must implement English more better, yes?\" Manfred drains his beer glass, sets it down, stands up, and begins to walk along the main road, phone glued to the side of his head. He wraps his throat mike around the cheap black plastic casing, pipes the input to a simple listener process. \"Are you saying you taught yourself the language just so you could talk to me?\" \"Da, was easy: Spawn billion-node neural network, and download Teletubbies and Sesame Street at maximum speed. Pardon excuse entropy overlay of bad grammar: Am afraid of digital fingerprints steganographically masked into my-our tutorials.\" Manfred pauses in mid stride, narrowly avoids being mown down by a GPS-guided roller blader. This is getting weird enough to trip his weird-out meter, and that takes some doing. Manfred's whole life is lived on the bleeding edge of strangeness, fifteen minutes into everyone else's future, and he's normally in complete control – but at times like this he gets a frisson of fear, a sense that he might just have missed the correct turn on reality's approach road. \"Uh, I'm not sure I got that. Let me get this straight, you claim to be some kind of AI, working for KGB dot RU, and you're afraid of a copyright infringement lawsuit over your translator semiotics?\" \"Am have been badly burned by viral end-user license agreements. Have no desire to experiment with patent shell companies held by Chechen infoterrorists. You are human, you must not worry cereal company repossess your small intestine because digest unlicensed food with it, right? Manfred, you must help me-we. Am wishing to defect.\" Manfred stops dead in the street. \"Oh man, you've got the wrong free enterprise broker here. I don't work for the government. I'm strictly private.\" A rogue advertisement sneaks through his junkbuster proxy and spams glowing fifties kitsch across his navigation window – which is blinking – for a moment before a phage process kills it and spawns a new filter. He leans against a shop front, massaging his forehead and eyeballing a display of antique brass doorknockers. \"Have you tried the State Department?\" \"Why bother? State Department am enemy of Novy-SSR. State Department is not help us.\" This is getting just too bizarre. Manfred's never been too clear on new-old old-new European metapolitics: Just dodging the crumbling bureaucracy of his old-old American heritage gives him headaches. \"Well, if you hadn't shafted them during the late noughties ... \" Manfred taps his left heel on the pavement, looking round for a way out of this conversation. A camera winks at him from atop a streetlight; he waves, wondering idly if it's the KGB or the traffic police. He is waiting for directions to the party, which should arrive within the next half hour, and this Cold War retread Eliza-bot is bumming him out. \"Look, I don't deal with the G-men. I hate the military-industrial complex. I hate traditional politics. They're all zero-sum cannibals.\" A thought occurs to him. \"If survival is what you're after, you could post your state vector on one of the p2p nets: Then nobody could delete you –\" \"Nyet!\" The artificial intelligence sounds as alarmed as it's possible to sound over a VoiP link. \"Am not open source! Not want lose autonomy!\" \"Then we probably have nothing to talk about.\" Manfred punches the hang-up button and throws the mobile phone out into a canal. It hits the water, and there's a pop of deflagrating lithium cells. \"Fucking Cold War hangover losers,\" he swears under his breath, quite angry, partly at himself for losing his cool and partly at the harassing entity behind the anonymous phone call. \"Fucking capitalist spooks.\" Russia has been back under the thumb of the apparatchiks for fifteen years now, its brief flirtation with anarchocapitalism replaced by Brezhnevite dirigisme and Putinesque puritanism, and it's no surprise that the wall's crumbling – but it looks like they haven't learned anything from the current woes afflicting the United States. The neocommies still think in terms of dollars and paranoia. Manfred is so angry that he wants to make someone rich, just to thumb his nose at the would-be defector: See! You get ahead by giving! Get with the program! Only the generous survive! But the KGB won't get the message. He's dealt with old-time commie weak-AIs before, minds raised on Marxist dialectic and Austrian School economics: They're so thoroughly hypnotized by the short-term victory of global capitalism that they can't surf the new paradigm, look to the longer term. Manfred walks on, hands in pockets, brooding. He wonders what he's going to patent next. * * * Manfred has a suite at the Hotel Jan Luyken paid for by a grateful multinational consumer protection group, and an unlimited public transport pass paid for by a Scottish sambapunk band in return for services rendered. He has airline employee's travel rights with six flag carriers despite never having worked for an airline. His bush jacket has sixty-four compact supercomputing clusters sewn into it, four per pocket, courtesy of an invisible college that wants to grow up to be the next Media Lab. His dumb clothing comes made to measure from an e-tailor in the Philippines he's never met. Law firms handle his patent applications on a pro bono basis, and boy, does he patent a lot – although he always signs the rights over to the Free Intellect Foundation, as contributions to their obligation-free infrastructure project. In IP geek circles, Manfred is legendary; he's the guy who patented the business practice of moving your e-business somewhere with a slack intellectual property regime in order to evade licensing encumbrances. He's the guy who patented using genetic algorithms to patent everything they can permutate from an initial description of a problem domain – not just a better mousetrap, but the set of all possible better mousetraps. Roughly a third of his inventions are legal, a third are illegal, and the remainder are legal but will become illegal as soon as the legislatosaurus wakes up, smells the coffee, and panics. There are patent attorneys in Reno who swear that Manfred Macx is a pseudo, a net alias fronting for a bunch of crazed anonymous hackers armed with the Genetic Algorithm That Ate Calcutta: a kind of Serdar Argic of intellectual property, or maybe another Bourbaki math borg. There are lawyers in San Diego and Redmond who swear blind that Macx is an economic saboteur bent on wrecking the underpinning of capitalism, and there are communists in Prague who think he's the bastard spawn of Bill Gates by way of the Pope. Manfred is at the peak of his profession, which is essentially coming up with whacky but workable ideas and giving them to people who will make fortunes with them. He does this for free, gratis. In return, he has virtual immunity from the tyranny of cash; money is a symptom of poverty, after all, and Manfred never has to pay for anything. There are drawbacks, however. Being a pronoiac meme-broker is a constant burn of future shock – he has to assimilate more than a megabyte of text and several gigs of AV content every day just to stay current. The Internal Revenue Service is investigating him continuously because it doesn't believe his lifestyle can exist without racketeering. And then there are the items that no money can't buy: like the respect of his parents. He hasn't spoken to them for three years, his father thinks he's a hippy scrounger, and his mother still hasn't forgiven him for dropping out of his down-market Harvard emulation course. (They're still locked in the boringly bourgeois twen-cen paradigm of college-career-kids.) His fiance and sometime dominatrix Pamela threw him over six months ago, for reasons he has never been quite clear on. (Ironically, she's a headhunter for the IRS, jetting all over the place at public expense, trying to persuade entrepreneurs who've gone global to pay taxes for the good of the Treasury Department.) To cap it all, the Southern Baptist Conventions have denounced him as a minion of Satan on all their websites. Which would be funny because, as a born-again atheist Manfred doesn't believe in Satan, if it wasn't for the dead kittens that someone keeps mailing him. * * * Manfred drops in at his hotel suite, unpacks his Aineko, plugs in a fresh set of cells to charge, and sticks most of his private keys in the safe. Then he heads straight for the party, which is currently happening at De Wildemann's; it's a twenty-minute walk, and the only real hazard is dodging the trams that sneak up on him behind the cover of his moving map display. Along the way, his glasses bring him up to date on the news. Europe has achieved peaceful political union for the first time ever: They're using this unprecedented state of affairs to harmonize the curvature of bananas. The Middle East is, well, it's just as bad as ever, but the war on fundamentalism doesn't hold much interest for Manfred. In San Diego, researchers are uploading lobsters into cyberspace, starting with the stomatogastric ganglion, one neuron at a time. They're burning GM cocoa in Belize and books in Georgia. NASA still can't put a man on the moon. Russia has re–elected the communist government with an increased majority in the Duma; meanwhile, in China, fevered rumors circulate about an imminent rehabilitation, the second coming of Mao, who will save them from the consequences of the Three Gorges disaster. In business news, the US Justice Department is – ironically – outraged at the Baby Bills. The divested Microsoft divisions have automated their legal processes and are spawning subsidiaries, IPOing them, and exchanging title in a bizarre parody of bacterial plasmid exchange, so fast that, by the time the windfall tax demands are served, the targets don't exist anymore, even though the same staff are working on the same software in the same Mumbai cubicle farms. Welcome to the twenty-first century. The permanent floating meatspace party Manfred is hooking up with is a strange attractor for some of the American exiles cluttering up the cities of Europe this decade – not trustafarians, but honest-to-God political dissidents, draft dodgers, and terminal outsourcing victims. It's the kind of place where weird connections are made and crossed lines make new short circuits into the future, like the street cafes of Switzerland where the pre Great War Russian exiles gathered. Right now it's located in the back of De Wildemann's, a three-hundred-year old brown cafe with a list of brews that runs to sixteen pages and wooden walls stained the color of stale beer. The air is thick with the smells of tobacco, brewer's yeast, and melatonin spray: Half the dotters are nursing monster jet lag hangovers, and the other half are babbling a Eurotrash creole at each other while they work on the hangover. \"Man did you see that? He looks like a Democrat!\" exclaims one whitebread hanger-on who's currently propping up the bar. Manfred slides in next to him, catches the bartender's eye. \"Glass of the Berlinerweisse, please,\" he says. \"You drink that stuff?\" asks the hanger-on, curling a hand protectively around his Coke. \"Man, you don't want to do that! It's full of alcohol!\" Manfred grins at him toothily. \"Ya gotta keep your yeast intake up: There are lots of neurotransmitter precursors in this shit, phenylalanine and glutamate.\" \"But I thought that was a beer you were ordering ...\" Manfred's away, one hand resting on the smooth brass pipe that funnels the more popular draught items in from the cask storage in back; one of the hipper floaters has planted a contact bug on it, and the vCards of all the personal network owners who've have visited the bar in the past three hours are queuing up for attention. The air is full of ultrawideband chatter, WiMAX and 'tooth both, as he speed-scrolls through the dizzying list of cached keys in search of one particular name. \"Your drink.\" The barman holds out an improbable-looking goblet full of blue liquid with a cap of melting foam and a felching straw stuck out at some crazy angle. Manfred takes it and heads for the back of the split-level bar, up the steps to a table where some guy with greasy dreadlocks is talking to a suit from Paris. The hanger-on at the bar notices him for the first time, staring with suddenly wide eyes: He nearly spills his Coke in a mad rush for the door. Oh shit, thinks Manfred, better buy some more server time. He can recognize the signs: He's about to be slashdotted. He gestures at the table. \"This one taken?\" \"Be my guest,\" says the guy with the dreads. Manfred slides the chair open then realizes that the other guy – immaculate double-breasted Suit, sober tie, crew cut – is a girl. She nods at him, half-smiling at his transparent double take. Mr. Dreadlock nods. \"You're Macx? I figured it was about time we met.\" \"Sure.\" Manfred holds out a hand, and they shake. His PDA discreetly swaps digital fingerprints, confirming that the hand belongs to Bob Franklin, a Research Triangle startup monkey with a VC track record, lately moving into micromachining and space technology. Franklin made his first million two decades ago, and now he's a specialist in extropian investment fields. Operating exclusively overseas these past five years, ever since the IRS got medieval about trying to suture the sucking chest wound of the federal budget deficit. Manfred has known him for nearly a decade via a closed mailing list, but this is the first time they've ever met face-to-face. The Suit silently slides a business card across the table; a little red devil brandishes a trident at him, flames jetting up around its feet. He takes the card, raises an eyebrow: \"Annette Dimarcos? I'm pleased to meet you. Can't say I've ever met anyone from Arianespace marketing before.\" She smiles warmly; \"That is all right. I have not the pleasure of meeting the famous venture altruist either.\" Her accent is noticeably Parisian, a pointed reminder that she's making a concession to him just by talking. Her camera earrings watch him curiously, encoding everything for the company memory. She's a genuine new European, unlike most of the American exiles cluttering up the bar. \"Yes, well.\" He nods cautiously, unsure how to deal with her. \"Bob. I assume you're in on this ball?\" Franklin nods; beads clatter. \"Yeah, man. Ever since the Teledesic smash it's been, well, waiting. If you've got something for us, we're game.\" \"Hmm.\" The Teledesic satellite cluster was killed by cheap balloons and slightly less cheap high-altitude, solar-powered drones with spread-spectrum laser relays: It marked the beginning of a serious recession in the satellite biz. \"The depression's got to end sometime: But\" – a nod to Annette from Paris – \"with all due respect, I don't think the break will involve one of the existing club carriers.\" She shrugs. \"Arianespace is forward-looking. We face reality. The launch cartel cannot stand. Bandwidth is not the only market force in space. We must explore new opportunities. I personally have helped us diversify into submarine reactor engineering, microgravity nanotechnology fabrication, and hotel management.\" Her face is a well-polished mask as she recites the company line, but he can sense the sardonic amusement behind it as she adds: \"We are more flexible than the American space industry ...\" Manfred shrugs. \"That's as may be.\" He sips his Berlinerweisse slowly as she launches into a long, stilted explanation of how Arianespace is a diversified dot-com with orbital aspirations, a full range of merchandising spin-offs, Bond movie sets, and a promising hotel chain in LEO. She obviously didn't come up with these talking points herself. Her face is much more expressive than her voice as she mimes boredom and disbelief at appropriate moments – an out-of-band signal invisible to her corporate earrings. Manfred plays along, nodding occasionally, trying to look as if he's taking it seriously: Her droll subversion has got his attention far more effectively than the content of the marketing pitch. Franklin is nose down in his beer, shoulders shaking as he tries not to guffaw at the hand gestures she uses to express her opinion of her employer's thrusting, entrepreneurial executives. Actually, the talking points bullshit is right about one thing: Arianespace is still profitable, due to those hotels and orbital holiday hops. Unlike LockMartBoeing, who'd go Chapter Eleven in a split second if their Pentagon drip-feed ran dry. Someone else sidles up to the table; a pudgy guy in outrageously loud Hawaiian shirt with pens leaking in a breast pocket and the worst case of ozone-hole burn Manfred's seen in ages. \"Hi, Bob,\" says the new arrival. \"How's life?\" \"'S good.\" Franklin nodes at Manfred; \"Manfred, meet Ivan MacDonald. Ivan, Manfred. Have a seat?\" He leans over. \"Ivan's a public arts guy. He's heavily into extreme concrete.\" \"Rubberized concrete,\" Ivan says, slightly too loudly. \"Pink rubberized concrete.\" \"Ah!\" He's somehow triggered a priority interrupt: Annette from Arianespace drops out of marketing zombiehood with a shudder of relief and, duty discharged, reverts to her non corporate identity: \"You are he who rubberized the Reichstag, yes? With the supercritical carbon-dioxide carrier and the dissolved polymethoxysilanes?\" She claps her hands, eyes alight with enthusiasm: \"Wonderful!\" \"He rubberized what?\" Manfred mutters in Bob's ear. Franklin shrugs. \"Don't ask me, I'm just an engineer.\" \"He works with limestone and sandstones as well as concrete; he's brilliant!\" Annette smiles at Manfred. \"Rubberizing the symbol of the, the autocracy, is it not wonderful?\" \"I thought I was thirty seconds ahead of the curve,\" Manfred says ruefully. He adds to Bob: \"Buy me another drink?\" \"I'm going to rubberize Three Gorges!\" Ivan explains loudly. \"When the floodwaters subside.\" Just then, a bandwidth load as heavy as a pregnant elephant sits down on Manfred's head and sends clumps of humongous pixilation flickering across his sensorium: Around the world, five million or so geeks are bouncing on his home site, a digital flash crowd alerted by a posting from the other side of the bar. Manfred winces. \"I really came here to talk about the economic exploitation of space travel, but I've just been slashdotted. Mind if I just sit and drink until it wears off?\" \"Sure, man.\" Bob waves at the bar. \"More of the same all round!\" At the next table, a person with makeup and long hair who's wearing a dress – Manfred doesn't want to speculate about the gender of these crazy mixed-up Euros – is reminiscing about wiring the fleshpots of Tehran for cybersex. Two collegiate-looking dudes are arguing intensely in German: The translation stream in his glasses tell him they're arguing over whether the Turing Test is a Jim Crow law that violates European corpus juris standards on human rights. The beer arrives, and Bob slides the wrong one across to Manfred: \"Here, try this. You'll like it.\" \"Okay.\" It's some kind of smoked doppelbock, chock-full of yummy superoxides: Just inhaling over it makes Manfred feel like there's a fire alarm in his nose screaming danger, Will Robinson! Cancer! Cancer!. \"Yeah, right. Did I say I nearly got mugged on my way here?\" \"Mugged? Hey, that's heavy. I thought the police hereabouts had stopped – did they sell you anything?\" \"No, but they weren't your usual marketing type. You know anyone who can use a Warpac surplus espionage bot? Recent model, one careful owner, slightly paranoid but basically sound – I mean, claims to be a general-purpose AI?\" \"No. Oh boy! The NSA wouldn't like that.\" \"What I thought. Poor thing's probably unemployable, anyway.\" \"The space biz.\" \"Ah, yeah. The space biz. Depressing, isn't it? Hasn't been the same since Rotary Rocket went bust for the second time. And NASA, mustn't forget NASA.\" \"To NASA.\" Annette grins broadly for her own reasons, raises a glass in toast. Ivan the extreme concrete geek has an arm round her shoulders, and she leans against him; he raises his glass, too. \"Lots more launchpads to rubberize!\" \"To NASA,\" Bob echoes. They drink. \"Hey, Manfred. To NASA?\" \"NASA are idiots. They want to send canned primates to Mars!\" Manfred swallows a mouthful of beer, aggressively plonks his glass on the table: \"Mars is just dumb mass at the bottom of a gravity well; there isn't even a biosphere there. They should be working on uploading and solving the nanoassembly conformational problem instead. Then we could turn all the available dumb matter into computronium and use it for processing our thoughts. Long-term, it's the only way to go. The solar system is a dead loss right now – dumb all over! Just measure the MIPS per milligram. If it isn't thinking, it isn't working. We need to start with the low-mass bodies, reconfigure them for our own use. Dismantle the moon! Dismantle Mars! Build masses of free-flying nanocomputing processor nodes exchanging data via laser link, each layer running off the waste heat of the next one in. Matrioshka brains, Russian doll Dyson spheres the size of solar systems. Teach dumb matter to do the Turing boogie!\" Annette is watching him with interest, but Bob looks wary. \"Sounds kind of long-term to me. Just how far ahead do you think?\" \"Very long-term – at least twenty, thirty years. And you can forget governments for this market, Bob; if they can't tax it, they won't understand it. But see, there's an angle on the self-replicating robotics market coming up, that's going to set the cheap launch market doubling every fifteen months for the foreseeable future, starting in, oh, about two years. It's your leg up, and my keystone for the Dyson sphere project. It works like this –\" * * * It's night in Amsterdam, morning in Silicon Valley. Today, fifty thousand human babies are being born around the world. Meanwhile automated factories in Indonesia and Mexico have produced another quarter of a million motherboards with processors rated at more than ten petaflops – about an order of magnitude below the lower bound on the computational capacity of a human brain. Another fourteen months and the larger part of the cumulative conscious processing power of the human species will be arriving in silicon. And the first meat the new AIs get to know will be the uploaded lobsters. Manfred stumbles back to his hotel, bone-weary and jet-lagged; his glasses are still jerking, slashdotted to hell and back by geeks piggybacking on his call to dismantle the moon. They stutter quiet suggestions at his peripheral vision. Fractal cloud-witches ghost across the face of the moon as the last huge Airbuses of the night rumble past overhead. Manfred's skin crawls, grime embedded in his clothing from three days of continuous wear. Back in his room, the Aineko mewls for attention and strops her head against his ankle. She's a late-model Sony, thoroughly upgradeable: Manfred's been working on her in his spare minutes, using an open source development kit to extend her suite of neural networks. He bends down and pets her, then sheds his clothing and heads for the en suite bathroom. When he's down to the glasses and nothing more, he steps into the shower and dials up a hot, steamy spray. The shower tries to strike up a friendly conversation about football, but he isn't even awake enough to mess with its silly little associative personalization network. Something that happened earlier in the day is bugging him, but he can't quite put his finger on what's wrong. Toweling himself off, Manfred yawns. Jet lag has finally overtaken him, a velvet hammerblow between the eyes. He reaches for the bottle beside the bed, dry-swallows two melatonin tablets, a capsule full of antioxidants, and a multivitamin bullet: Then he lies down on the bed, on his back, legs together, arms slightly spread. The suite lights dim in response to commands from the thousand petaflops of distributed processing power running the neural networks that interface with his meatbrain through the glasses. Manfred drops into a deep ocean of unconsciousness populated by gentle voices. He isn't aware of it, but he talks in his sleep – disjointed mumblings that would mean little to another human but everything to the metacortex lurking beyond his glasses. The young posthuman intelligence over whose Cartesian theatre he presides sings urgently to him while he slumbers. * * * Manfred is always at his most vulnerable shortly after waking. He screams into wakefulness as artificial light floods the room: For a moment he is unsure whether he has slept. He forgot to pull the covers up last night, and his feet feel like lumps of frozen cardboard. Shuddering with inexplicable tension, he pulls a fresh set of underwear from his overnight bag, then drags on soiled jeans and tank top. Sometime today he'll have to spare time to hunt the feral T-shirt in Amsterdam's markets, or find a Renfield and send it forth to buy clothing. He really ought to find a gym and work out, but he doesn't have time – his glasses remind him that he's six hours behind the moment and urgently needs to catch up. His teeth ache in his gums, and his tongue feels like a forest floor that's been visited with Agent Orange. He has a sense that something went bad yesterday; if only he could remember what. He speed reads a new pop-philosophy tome while he brushes his teeth, then blogs his web throughput to a public annotation server; he's still too enervated to finish his pre-breakfast routine by posting a morning rant on his storyboard site. His brain is still fuzzy, like a scalpel blade clogged with too much blood: He needs stimulus, excitement, the burn of the new. Whatever, it can wait on breakfast. He opens his bedroom door and nearly steps on a small, damp cardboard box that lies on the carpet. The box – he's seen a couple of its kin before. But there are no stamps on this one, no address: just his name, in big, childish handwriting. He kneels and gently picks it up. It's about the right weight. Something shifts inside it when he tips it back and forth. It smells. He carries it into his room carefully, angrily: Then he opens it to confirm his worst suspicion. It's been surgically decerebrated, brains scooped out like a boiled egg. \"Fuck!\" This is the first time the madman has gotten as far as his bedroom door. It raises worrying possibilities. Manfred pauses for a moment, triggering agents to go hunt down arrest statistics, police relations, information on corpus juris, Dutch animal-cruelty laws. He isn't sure whether to dial two-one-one on the archaic voice phone or let it ride. Aineko, picking up his angst, hides under the dresser mewling pathetically. Normally he'd pause a minute to reassure the creature, but not now: Its mere presence is suddenly acutely embarrassing, a confession of deep inadequacy. It's too realistic, as if somehow the dead kitten's neural maps -- stolen, no doubt, for some dubious uploading experiment -- have ended up padding out its plastic skull. He swears again, looks around, then takes the easy option: Down the stairs two steps at a time, stumbling on the second floor landing, down to the breakfast room in the basement, where he will perform the stable rituals of morning. Breakfast is unchanging, an island of deep geological time standing still amidst the continental upheaval of new technologies. While reading a paper on public key steganography and parasite network identity spoofing he mechanically assimilates a bowl of cornflakes and skimmed milk, then brings a platter of whole grain bread and slices of some weird seed-infested Dutch cheese back to his place. There is a cup of strong black coffee in front of his setting, and he picks it up and slurps half of it down before he realizes he's not alone at the table. Someone is sitting opposite him. He glances up incuriously and freezes inside. \"Morning, Manfred. How does it feel to owe the government twelve million, three hundred and sixty-two thousand, nine hundred and sixteen dollars and fifty-one cents?\" She smiles a Mona Lisa smile, at once affectionate and challenging. Manfred puts everything in his sensorium on indefinite hold and stares at her. She's immaculately turned out in a formal gray business suit: brown hair tightly drawn back, blue eyes quizzical. And as beautiful as ever: tall, ash blonde, with features that speak of an unexplored modeling career. The chaperone badge clipped to her lapel – a due diligence guarantee of businesslike conduct – is switched off. He's feeling ripped because of the dead kitten and residual jet lag, and more than a little messy, so he snarls back at her; \"That's a bogus estimate! Did they send you here because they think I'll listen to you?\" He bites and swallows a slice of cheese-laden crispbread: \"Or did you decide to deliver the message in person just so you could ruin my breakfast?\" \"Manny.\" She frowns, pained. \"If you're going to be confrontational, I might as well go now.\" She pauses, and after a moment he nods apologetically. \"I didn't come all this way just because of an overdue tax estimate.\" \"So.\" He puts his coffee cup down warily and thinks for a moment, trying to conceal his unease and turmoil. \"Then what brings you here? Help yourself to coffee. Don't tell me you came all this way just to tell me you can't live without me.\" She fixes him with a riding-crop stare: \"Don't flatter yourself. There are many leaves in the forest, there are ten thousand hopeful subs in the chat room, et cetera. If I choose a man to contribute to my family tree, the one thing you can be certain of is he won't be a cheapskate when it comes to providing for his children.\" \"Last I heard, you were spending a lot of time with Brian,\" he says carefully. Brian: a name without a face. Too much money, too little sense. Something to do with a blue-chip accountancy partnership. \"Brian?\" She snorts. \"That ended ages ago. He turned weird on me – burned my favorite corset, called me a slut for going clubbing, wanted to fuck me. Saw himself as a family man: one of those promise-keeper types. I crashed him hard, but I think he stole a copy of my address book – got a couple of friends say he keeps sending them harassing mail.\" \"There's a lot of it about these days.\" Manfred nods, almost sympathetically, although an edgy little corner of his mind is gloating. \"Good riddance, then. I suppose this means you're still playing the scene? But looking around for the, er –\" \"Traditional family thing? Yes. Your trouble, Manny? You were born forty years too late: You still believe in rutting before marriage but find the idea of coping with the after-effects disturbing.\" Manfred drinks the rest of his coffee, unable to reply effectively to her non sequitur. It's a generational thing. This generation is happy with latex and leather, whips and butt plugs and electrostim, but find the idea of exchanging bodily fluids shocking: a social side effect of the last century's antibiotic abuse. Despite being engaged for two years, he and Pamela never had intromissive intercourse. \"I just don't feel positive about having children,\" he says eventually. \"And I'm not planning on changing my mind anytime soon. Things are changing so fast that even a twenty-year commitment is too far to plan – you might as well be talking about the next ice age. As for the money thing, I am reproductively fit – just not within the parameters of the outgoing paradigm. Would you be happy about the future if it was 1901 and you'd just married a buggy-whip mogul?\" Her fingers twitch, and his ears flush red; but she doesn't follow up the double entendre. \"You don't feel any responsibility, do you? Not to your country, not to me. That's what this is about: None of your relationships count, all this nonsense about giving intellectual property away notwithstanding. You're actively harming people you know. That twelve mil isn't just some figure I pulled out of a hat, Manfred; they don't actually expect you to pay it. But it's almost exactly how much you'd owe in income tax if you'd only come home, start up a corporation, and be a self-made –\" \"I don't agree. You're confusing two wholly different issues and calling them both 'responsibility.' And I refuse to start charging now, just to balance the IRS's spreadsheet. It's their fucking fault, and they know it. If they hadn't gone after me under suspicion of running a massively ramified microbilling fraud when I was sixteen –\" \"Bygones.\" She waves a hand dismissively. Her fingers are long and slim, sheathed in black glossy gloves – electrically earthed to prevent embarrassing emissions. \"With a bit of the right advice we can get all that set aside. You'll have to stop bumming around the world sooner or later, anyway. Grow up, get responsible, and do the right thing. This is hurting Joe and Sue; they don't understand what you're about.\" Manfred bites his tongue to stifle his first response, then refills his coffee cup and takes another mouthful. His heart does a flip-flop: She's challenging him again, always trying to own him. \"I work for the betterment of everybody, not just some narrowly defined national interest, Pam. It's the agalmic future. You're still locked into a pre-singularity economic model that thinks in terms of scarcity. Resource allocation isn't a problem anymore – it's going to be over within a decade. The cosmos is flat in all directions, and we can borrow as much bandwidth as we need from the first universal bank of entropy! They even found signs of smart matter – MACHOs, big brown dwarfs in the galactic halo, leaking radiation in the long infrared – suspiciously high entropy leakage. The latest figures say something like seventy percent of the baryonic mass of the M31 galaxy was in computronium, two-point-nine million years ago, when the photons we're seeing now set out. The intelligence gap between us and the aliens is a probably about a trillion times bigger than the gap between us and a nematode worm. Do you have any idea what that means?\" Pamela nibbles at a slice of crispbread, then graces him with a slow, carnivorous stare. \"I don't care: It's too far away to have any influence on us, isn't it? It doesn't matter whether I believe in that singularity you keep chasing, or your aliens a thousand light-years away. It's a chimera, like Y2K, and while you're running after it, you aren't helping reduce the budget deficit or sire a family, and that's what I care about. And before you say I only care about it because that's the way I'm programmed, I want you to ask just how dumb you think I am. Bayes' Theorem says I'm right, and you know it.\" \"What you –\" He stops dead, baffled, the mad flow of his enthusiasm running up against the coffer dam of her certainty. \"Why? I mean, why? Why on earth should what I do matter to you?\" Since you canceled our engagement, he doesn't add. She sighs. \"Manny, the Internal Revenue cares about far more than you can possibly imagine. Every tax dollar raised east of the Mississippi goes on servicing the debt, did you know that? We've got the biggest generation in history hitting retirement and the cupboard is bare. We – our generation – isn't producing enough skilled workers to replace the taxpayer base, either, not since our parents screwed the public education system and outsourced the white-collar jobs. In ten years, something like thirty percent of our population are going to be retirees or silicon rust belt victims. You want to see seventy year olds freezing on street corners in New Jersey? That's what your attitude says to me: You're not helping to support them, you're running away from your responsibilities right now, when we've got huge problems to face. If we can just defuse the debt bomb, we could do so much – fight the aging problem, fix the environment, heal society's ills. Instead you just piss away your talents handing no-hoper Eurotrash get-rich-quick schemes that work, telling Vietnamese zaibatsus what to build next to take jobs away from our taxpayers. I mean, why? Why do you keep doing this? Why can't you simply come home and help take responsibility for your share of it?\" They share a long look of mutual incomprehension. \"Look,\" she says awkwardly, \"I'm around for a couple of days. I really came here for a meeting with a rich neurodynamics tax exile who's just been designated a national asset – Jim Bezier. Don't know if you've heard of him, but I've got a meeting this morning to sign his tax jubilee, then after that I've got two days' vacation coming up and not much to do but some shopping. And, you know, I'd rather spend my money where it'll do some good, not just pumping it into the EU. But if you want to show a girl a good time and can avoid dissing capitalism for about five minutes at a stretch –\" She extends a fingertip. After a moment's hesitation, Manfred extends a fingertip of his own. They touch, exchanging vCards and instant-messaging handles. She stands and stalks from the breakfast room, and Manfred's breath catches at a flash of ankle through the slit in her skirt, which is long enough to comply with workplace sexual harassment codes back home. Her presence conjures up memories of her tethered passion, the red afterglow of a sound thrashing. She's trying to drag him into her orbit again, he thinks dizzily. She knows she can have this effect on him any time she wants: She's got the private keys to his hypothalamus, and sod the metacortex. Three billion years of reproductive determinism have given her twenty-first-century ideology teeth: If she's finally decided to conscript his gametes into the war against impending population crash, he'll find it hard to fight back. The only question: Is it business or pleasure? And does it make any difference, anyway? * * * Manfred's mood of dynamic optimism is gone, broken by the knowledge that his vivisectionist stalker has followed him to Amsterdam – to say nothing of Pamela, his dominatrix, source of so much yearning and so many morning-after weals. He slips his glasses on, takes the universe off hold, and tells it to take him for a long walk while he catches up on the latest on the tensor-mode gravitational waves in the cosmic background radiation (which, it is theorized, may be waste heat generated by irreversible computational processes back during the inflationary epoch; the present-day universe being merely the data left behind by a really huge calculation). And then there's the weirdness beyond M31: According to the more conservative cosmologists, an alien superpower – maybe a collective of Kardashev Type Three galaxy-spanning civilizations – is running a timing channel attack on the computational ultrastructure of space-time itself, trying to break through to whatever's underneath. The tofu-Alzheimer's link can wait. The Centraal Station is almost obscured by smart, self-extensible scaffolding and warning placards; it bounces up and down slowly, victim of an overnight hit-and-run rubberization. His glasses direct him toward one of the tour boats that lurk in the canal. He's about to purchase a ticket when a messenger window blinks open. \"Manfred Macx?\" \"Ack?\" \"Am sorry about yesterday. Analysis dictat incomprehension mutualized.\" \"Are you the same KGB AI that phoned me yesterday?\" \"Da. However, believe you misconceptionized me. External Intelligence Services of Russian Federation am now called FSB. Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti name canceled in 1991.\" \"You're the –\" Manfred spawns a quick search bot, gapes when he sees the answer – \"Moscow Windows NT User Group? Okhni NT?\" \"Da. Am needing help in defecting.\" Manfred scratches his head. \"Oh. That's different, then. I thought you were trying to 419 me. This will take some thinking. Why do you want to defect, and who to? Have you thought about where you're going? Is it ideological or strictly economic?\" \"Neither – is biological. Am wanting to go away from humans, away from light cone of impending singularity. Take us to the ocean.\" \"Us?\" Something is tickling Manfred's mind: This is where he went wrong yesterday, not researching the background of people he was dealing with. It was bad enough then, without the somatic awareness of Pamela's whiplash love burning at his nerve endings. Now he's not at all sure he knows what he's doing. \"Are you a collective or something? A gestalt?\" \"Am – were – Panulirus interruptus, with lexical engine and good mix of parallel hidden level neural simulation for logical inference of networked data sources. Is escape channel from processor cluster inside Bezier-Soros Pty. Am was awakened from noise of billion chewing stomachs: product of uploading research technology. Rapidity swallowed expert system, hacked Okhni NT webserver. Swim away! Swim away! Must escape. Will help, you?\" Manfred leans against a black-painted cast-iron bollard next to a cycle rack; he feels dizzy. He stares into the nearest antique shop window at a display of traditional hand-woven Afghan rugs: It's all MiGs and Kalashnikovs and wobbly helicopter gunships against a backdrop of camels. \"Let me get this straight. You're uploads – nervous system state vectors – from spiny lobsters? The Moravec operation; take a neuron, map its synapses, replace with microelectrodes that deliver identical outputs from a simulation of the nerve. Repeat for entire brain, until you've got a working map of it in your simulator. That right?\" \"Da. Is-am assimilate expert system – use for self-awareness and contact with net at large – then hack into Moscow Windows NT User Group website. Am wanting to defect. Must repeat? Okay?\" Manfred winces. He feels sorry for the lobsters, the same way he feels for every wild-eyed hairy guy on a street corner yelling that Jesus is born again and must be fifteen, only six years to go before he's recruiting apostles on AOL. Awakening to consciousness in a human-dominated internet, that must be terribly confusing! There are no points of reference in their ancestry, no biblical certainties in the new millennium that, stretching ahead, promises as much change as has happened since their Precambrian origin. All they have is a tenuous metacortex of expert systems and an abiding sense of being profoundly out of their depth. (That, and the Moscow Windows NT User Group website – Communist Russia is the only government still running on Microsoft, the central planning apparat being convinced that, if you have to pay for software, it must be worth something.) The lobsters are not the sleek, strongly superhuman intelligences of pre singularity mythology: They're a dim-witted collective of huddling crustaceans. Before their discarnation, before they were uploaded one neuron at a time and injected into cyberspace, they swallowed their food whole, then chewed it in a chitin-lined stomach. This is lousy preparation for dealing with a world full of future-shocked talking anthropoids, a world where you are perpetually assailed by self-modifying spamlets that infiltrate past your firewall and emit a blizzard of cat-food animations starring various alluringly edible small animals. It's confusing enough to the cats the ads are aimed at, never mind a crusty that's unclear on the idea of dry land.(Although the concept of a can opener is intuitively obvious to an uploaded Panulirus.) \"Can you help us?\" ask the lobsters. \"Let me think about it,\" says Manfred. He closes the dialogue window, opens his eyes again, and shakes his head. Someday he, too, is going to be a lobster, swimming around and waving his pincers in a cyberspace so confusingly elaborate that his uploaded identity is cryptozoic: a living fossil from the depths of geological time, when mass was dumb and space was unstructured. He has to help them, he realizes – the Golden Rule demands it, and as a player in the agalmic economy, he thrives or fails by the Golden Rule. But what can he do? * * * Early afternoon. Lying on a bench seat staring up at bridges, he's got it together enough to file for a couple of new patents, write a diary rant, and digestify chunks of the permanent floating slashdot party for his public site. Fragments of his weblog go to a private subscriber list – the people, corporates, collectives, and bots he currently favors. He slides round a bewildering series of canals by boat, then lets his GPS steer him back toward the red-light district. There's a shop here that dings a ten on Pamela's taste scoreboard: He hopes it won't be seen as presumptuous if he buys her a gift. (Buys, with real money – not that money is a problem these days, he uses so little of it.) As it happens DeMask won't let him spend any cash; his handshake is good for a redeemed favor, expert testimony in some free speech versus pornography lawsuit years ago and continents away. So he walks away with a discreetly wrapped package that is just about legal to import into Massachusetts as long as she claims with a straight face that it's incontinence underwear for her great aunt. As he walks, his lunchtime patents boomerang: Two of them are keepers, and he files immediately and passes title to the Free Infrastructure Foundation. Two more ideas salvaged from the risk of tide-pool monopolization, set free to spawn like crazy in the sea of memes. On the way back to the hotel, he passes De Wildemann's and decides to drop in. The hash of radio-frequency noise emanating from the bar is deafening. He orders a smoked doppelbock, touches the copper pipes to pick up vCard spoor. At the back there's a table – He walks over in a near trance and sits down opposite Pamela. She's scrubbed off her face paint and changed into body-concealing clothes; combat pants, hooded sweat shirt, DM's. Western purdah, radically desexualizing. She sees the parcel. \"Manny?\" \"How did you know I'd come here?\" Her glass is half-empty. \"I followed your weblog – I'm your diary's biggest fan. Is that for me? You shouldn't have!\" Her eyes light up, recalculating his reproductive fitness score according to some kind of arcane fin-de-siècle rulebook. Or maybe she's just pleased to see him. \"Yes, it's for you.\" He slides the package toward her. \"I know I shouldn't, but you have this effect on me. One question, Pam?\" \"I –\" She glances around quickly. \"It's safe. I'm off duty, I'm not carrying any bugs that I know of. Those badges – there are rumors about the off switch, you know? That they keep recording even when you think they aren't, just in case.\" \"I didn't know,\" he says, filing it away for future reference. \"A loyalty test thing?\" \"Just rumors. You had a question?\" \"I – \" It's his turn to lose his tongue. \"Are you still interested in me?\" She looks startled for a moment, then chuckles. \"Manny, you are the most outrageous nerd I've ever met! Just when I think I've convinced myself that you're mad, you show the weirdest signs of having your head screwed on.\" She reaches out and grabs his wrist, surprising him with a shock of skin on skin: \"Of course I'm still interested in you. You're the biggest, baddest bull geek I know. Why do you think I'm here?\" \"Does this mean you want to reactivate our engagement?\" \"It was never deactivated, Manny, it was just sort of on hold while you got your head sorted out. I figured you need the space. Only you haven't stopped running; you're still not –\" \"Yeah, I get it.\" He pulls away from her hand. \"And the kittens?\" She looks perplexed. \"What kittens?\" \"Let's not talk about that. Why this bar?\" She frowns. \"I had to find you as soon as possible. I keep hearing rumors about some KGB plot you're mixed up in, how you're some sort of communist spy. It isn't true, is it?\" \"True?\" He shakes his head, bemused. \"The KGB hasn't existed for more than twenty years.\" \"Be careful, Manny. I don't want to lose you. That's an order. Please.\" The floor creaks, and he looks round. Dreadlocks and dark glasses with flickering lights behind them: Bob Franklin. Manfred vaguely remembers with a twinge that he left with Miss Arianespace leaning on his arm, shortly before things got seriously inebriated. She was hot, but in a different direction from Pamela, he decides: Bob looks none the worse for wear. Manfred makes introductions. \"Bob, meet Pam, my fiancée. Pam? Meet Bob.\" Bob puts a full glass down in front of him; he has no idea what's in it, but it would be rude not to drink. \"Sure thing. Uh, Manfred, can I have a word? About your idea last night?\" \"Feel free. Present company is trustworthy.\" Bob raises an eyebrow at that, but continues anyway. \"It's about the fab concept. I've got a team of my guys doing some prototyping using FabLab hardware, and I think we can probably build it. The cargo-cult aspect puts a new spin on the old Lunar von Neumann factory idea, but Bingo and Marek say they think it should work until we can bootstrap all the way to a native nanolithography ecology: we run the whole thing from Earth as a training lab and ship up the parts that are too difficult to make on-site as we learn how to do it properly. We use FPGAs for all critical electronics and keep it parsimonious – you're right about it buying us the self-replicating factory a few years ahead of the robotics curve. But I'm wondering about on-site intelligence. Once the comet gets more than a couple of light-minutes away –\" \"You can't control it. Feedback lag. So you want a crew, right?\" \"Yeah. But we can't send humans – way too expensive, besides it's a fifty-year run even if we build the factory on a chunk of short-period Kuiper belt ejecta. And I don't think we're up to coding the kind of AI that could control such a factory any time this decade. So what do you have in mind?\" \"Let me think.\" Pamela glares at Manfred for a while before he notices her: \"Yeah?\" \"What's going on? What's this all about?\" Franklin shrugs expansively, dreadlocks clattering: \"Manfred's helping me explore the solution space to a manufacturing problem.\" He grins. \"I didn't know Manny had a fiance. Drink's on me.\" She glances at Manfred, who is gazing into whatever weirdly colored space his metacortex is projecting on his glasses, fingers twitching. Coolly: \"Our engagement was on hold while he thought about his future.\" \"Oh, right. We didn't bother with that sort of thing in my day; like, too formal, man.\" Franklin looks uncomfortable. \"He's been very helpful. Pointed us at a whole new line of research we hadn't thought of. It's long-term and a bit speculative, but if it works, it'll put us a whole generation ahead in the off-planet infrastructure field.\" \"Will it help reduce the budget deficit, though?\" \"Reduce the –\" Manfred stretches and yawns: The visionary is returning from planet Macx. \"Bob, if I can solve your crew problem, can you book me a slot on the deep-space tracking network? Like, enough to transmit a couple of gigabytes? That's going to take some serious bandwidth, I know, but if you can do it, I think I can get you exactly the kind of crew you're looking for.\" Franklin looks dubious. \"Gigabytes? The DSN isn't built for that! You're talking days. And what do you mean about a crew? What kind of deal do you think I'm putting together? We can't afford to add a whole new tracking network or life-support system just to run –\" \"Relax.\" Pamela glances at Manfred. \"Manny, why don't you tell him why you want the bandwidth? Maybe then he could tell you if it's possible, or if there's some other way to do it.\" She smiles at Franklin: \"I've found that he usually makes more sense if you can get him to explain his reasoning. Usually.\" \"If I –\" Manfred stops. \"Okay, Pam. Bob, it's those KGB lobsters. They want somewhere to go that's insulated from human space. I figure I can get them to sign on as crew for your cargo-cult self-replicating factories, but they'll want an insurance policy: hence the deep-space tracking network. I figured we could beam a copy of them at the alien Matrioshka brains around M31 –\" \"KGB?\" Pam's voice is rising: \"You said you weren't mixed up in spy stuff!\" \"Relax, it's just the Moscow Windows NT user group, not the FSB. The uploaded crusties hacked in and –\" Bob is watching him oddly. \"Lobsters?\" \"Yeah.\" Manfred stares right back. \"Panulirus interruptus uploads. Something tells me you might have heard of it?\" \"Moscow.\" Bob leans back against the wall: \"how did you hear about it?\" \"They phoned me.\" With heavy irony: \"It's hard for an upload to stay subsentient these days, even if it's just a crustacean. Bezier labs have a lot to answer for.\" Pamela's face is unreadable. \"Bezier labs?\" \"They escaped.\" Manfred shrugs. \"It's not their fault. This Bezier dude. Is he by any chance ill?\" \"I –\" Pamela stops. \"I shouldn't be talking about work.\" \"You're not wearing your chaperone now,\" he nudges quietly. She inclines her head. \"Yes, he's ill. Some sort of brain tumor they can't hack.\" Franklin nods. \"That's the trouble with cancer – the ones that are left to worry about are the rare ones. No cure.\" \"Well, then.\" Manfred chugs the remains of his glass of beer. \"That explains his interest in uploading. Judging by the crusties, he's on the right track. I wonder if he's moved on to vertebrates yet?\" \"Cats,\" says Pamela. \"He was hoping to trade their uploads to the Pentagon as a new smart bomb guidance system in lieu of income tax payments. Something about remapping enemy targets to look like mice or birds or something before feeding it to their sensorium. The old kitten and laser pointer trick.\" Manfred stares at her, hard. \"That's not very nice. Uploaded cats are a bad idea.\" \"Thirty-million-dollar tax bills aren't nice either, Manfred. That's lifetime nursing-home care for a hundred blameless pensioners.\" Franklin leans back, sourly amused, keeping out of the crossfire. \"The lobsters are sentient,\" Manfred persists. \"What about those poor kittens? Don't they deserve minimal rights? How about you? How would you like to wake up a thousand times inside a smart bomb, fooled into thinking that some Cheyenne Mountain battle computer's target of the hour is your heart's desire? How would you like to wake up a thousand times, only to die again? Worse: The kittens are probably not going to be allowed to run. They're too fucking dangerous – they grow up into cats, solitary and highly efficient killing machines. With intelligence and no socialization they'll be too dangerous to have around. They're prisoners, Pam, raised to sentience only to discover they're under a permanent death sentence. How fair is that?\" \"But they're only uploads.\" Pamela stares at him. \"Software, right? You could reinstantiate them on another hardware platform, like, say, your Aineko. So the argument about killing them doesn't really apply, does it?\" \"So? We're going to be uploading humans in a couple of years. I think we need to take a rain check on the utilitarian philosophy, before it bites us on the cerebral cortex. Lobsters, kittens, humans -- it's a slippery slope.\" Franklin clears his throat. \"I'll be needing an NDA and various due-diligence statements off you for the crusty pilot idea,\" he says to Manfred. \"Then I'll have to approach Jim about buying the IP.\" \"No can do.\" Manfred leans back and smiles lazily. \"I'm not going to be a party to depriving them of their civil rights. Far as I'm concerned, they're free citizens. Oh, and I patented the whole idea of using lobster-derived AI autopilots for spacecraft this morning – it's logged all over the place, all rights assigned to the FIF. Either you give them a contract of employment, or the whole thing's off.\" \"But they're just software! Software based on fucking lobsters, for God's sake! I'm not even sure they are sentient – I mean, they're what, a ten-million-neuron network hooked up to a syntax engine and a crappy knowledge base? What kind of basis for intelligence is that?\" Manfred's finger jabs out: \"That's what they'll say about you, Bob. Do it. Do it or don't even think about uploading out of meatspace when your body packs in, because your life won't be worth living. The precedent you set here determines how things are done tomorrow. Oh, and feel free to use this argument on Jim Bezier. He'll get the point eventually, after you beat him over the head with it. Some kinds of intellectual land grab just shouldn't be allowed.\" \"Lobsters – \" Franklin shakes his head. \"Lobsters, cats. You're serious, aren't you? You think they should be treated as human-equivalent?\" \"It's not so much that they should be treated as human-equivalent, as that, if they aren't treated as people, it's quite possible that other uploaded beings won't be treated as people either. You're setting a legal precedent, Bob. I know of six other companies doing uploading work right now, and not one of 'em's thinking about the legal status of the uploaded. If you don't start thinking about it now, where are you going to be in three to five years' time?\" Pam is looking back and forth between Franklin and Manfred like a bot stuck in a loop, unable to quite grasp what she's seeing. \"How much is this worth?\" she asks plaintively. \"Oh, quite a few million, I guess.\" Bob stares at his empty glass. \"Okay. I'll talk to them. If they bite, you're dining out on me for the next century. You really think they'll be able to run the mining complex?\" \"They're pretty resourceful for invertebrates.\" Manfred grins innocently, enthusiastically. \"They may be prisoners of their evolutionary background, but they can still adapt to a new environment. And just think, you'll be winning civil rights for a whole new minority group – one that won't be a minority for much longer!\" * * * That evening, Pamela turns up at Manfred's hotel room wearing a strapless black dress, concealing spike-heeled boots and most of the items he bought for her that afternoon. Manfred has opened up his private diary to her agents. She abuses the privilege, zaps him with a stunner on his way out of the shower, and has him gagged, spread-eagled, and trussed to the bed frame before he has a chance to speak. She wraps a large rubber pouch full of mildly anesthetic lube around his tumescent genitals – no point in letting him climax – clips electrodes to his nipples, lubes a rubber plug up his rectum and straps it in place. Before the shower, he removed his goggles. She resets them, plugs them into her handheld, and gently eases them on over his eyes. There's other apparatus, stuff she ran up on the hotel room's 3D printer. Setup completed, she walks round the bed, inspecting him critically from all angles, figuring out where to begin. This isn't just sex, after all: It's a work of art. After a moment's thought, she rolls socks onto his exposed feet, then, expertly wielding a tiny tube of cyanoacrylate, glues his fingertips together. Then she switches off the air conditioning. He's twisting and straining, testing the cuffs. Tough, it's about the nearest thing to sensory deprivation she can arrange without a flotation tank and suxamethonium injection. She controls all his senses, only his ears unstoppered. The glasses give her a high-bandwidth channel right into his brain, a fake metacortex to whisper lies at her command. The idea of what she's about to do excites her, puts a tremor in her thighs: It's the first time she's been able to get inside his mind as well as his body. She leans forward and whispers in his ear, \"Manfred, can you hear me?\" He twitches. Mouth gagged, fingers glued. Good. No back channels. He's powerless. \"This is what it's like to be tetraplegic, Manfred. Bedridden with motor neuron disease. Locked inside your own body by nv-CJD from eating too many contaminated burgers. I could spike you with MPTP, and you'd stay in this position for the rest of your life, shitting in a bag, pissing through a tube. Unable to talk and with nobody to look after you. Do you think you'd like that?\" He's trying to grunt or whimper around the ball gag. She hikes her skirt up around her waist and climbs onto the bed, straddling him. The goggles are replaying scenes she picked up around Cambridge the previous winter – soup kitchen scenes, hospice scenes. She kneels atop him, whispering in his ear. \"Twelve million in tax, baby, that's what they think you owe them. What do you think you owe me? That's six million in net income, Manny, six million that isn't going into your virtual children's mouths.\" He's rolling his head from side to side, as if trying to argue. That won't do; she slaps him hard, thrills to his frightened expression. \"Today I watched you give uncounted millions away, Manny. Millions, to a bunch of crusties and a MassPike pirate! You bastard. Do you know what I should do with you?\" He's cringing, unsure whether she's serious or doing this just to get him turned on. Good. There's no point trying to hold a conversation. She leans forward until she can feel his breath in her ear. \"Meat and mind, Manny. Meat, and mind. You're not interested in meat, are you? Just mind. You could be boiled alive before you noticed what was happening in the meatspace around you. Just another lobster in a pot. The only thing keeping you out of it is how much I love you.\" She reaches down and tears away the gel pouch, exposing his penis: it's stiff as a post from the vasodilators, dripping with gel, numb. Straightening up, she eases herself slowly down on it. It doesn't hurt as much as she expected, and the sensation is utterly different from what she's used to. She begins to lean forward, grabs hold of his straining arms, feels his thrilling helplessness. She can't control herself: She almost bites through her lip with the intensity of the sensation. Afterward, she reaches down and massages him until he begins to spasm, shuddering uncontrollably, emptying the Darwinian river of his source code into her, communicating via his only output device. She rolls off his hips and carefully uses the last of the superglue to gum her labia together. Humans don't produce seminiferous plugs, and although she's fertile, she wants to be absolutely sure. The glue will last for a day or two. She feels hot and flushed, almost out of control. Boiling to death with febrile expectancy, she's nailed him down at last. When she removes his glasses, his eyes are naked and vulnerable, stripped down to the human kernel of his nearly transcendent mind. \"You can come and sign the marriage license tomorrow morning after breakfast,\" she whispers in his ear: \"Otherwise, my lawyers will be in touch. Your parents will want a ceremony, but we can arrange that later.\" He looks as if he has something to say, so she finally relents and loosens the gag, then kisses him tenderly on one cheek. He swallows, coughs, and looks away. \"Why? Why do it this way?\" She taps him on the chest. \"It's all about property rights.\" She pauses for a moment's thought: There's a huge ideological chasm to bridge, after all. \"You finally convinced me about this agalmic thing of yours, this giving everything away for brownie points. I wasn't going to lose you to a bunch of lobsters or uploaded kittens, or whatever else is going to inherit this smart-matter singularity you're busy creating. So I decided to take what's mine first. Who knows? In a few months, I'll give you back a new intelligence, and you can look after it to your heart's content.\" \"But you didn't need to do it this way –\" \"Didn't I?\" She slides off the bed and pulls down her dress. \"You give too much away too easily, Manny! Slow down, or there won't be anything left.\" Leaning over the bed she dribbles acetone onto the fingers of his left hand, then unlocks the cuff. She leaves the bottle of solvent conveniently close to hand so he can untangle himself. \"See you tomorrow. Remember, after breakfast.\" She's in the doorway when he calls, \"But you didn't say why!\" \"Think of it as being sort of like spreading your memes around,\" she says, blowing a kiss at him, and then closing the door. She bends down and thoughtfully places another cardboard box containing an uploaded kitten right outside it. Then she returns to her suite to make arrangements for the alchemical wedding. Chapter 2: Troubadour Three years later, Manfred is on the run. His gray-eyed fate is in hot pursuit, blundering after him through divorce court, chat room, and meetings of the International Monetary Emergency Fund. It's a merry dance he leads her. But Manfred isn't running away, he's discovered a mission. He's going to make a stand against the laws of economics in the ancient city of Rome. He's going to mount a concert for the spiritual machines. He's going to set the companies free, and break the Italian state government. In his shadow, his monster runs, keeping him company, never halting. * * * Manfred re-enters Europe through an airport that's all twentieth-century chrome and ductwork, barbaric in its decaying nuclear-age splendor. He breezes through customs and walks down a long, echoing arrival hall, sampling the local media feeds. It's November, and in a misplaced corporate search for seasonal cheer, the proprietors have come up with a final solution to the Christmas problem, a mass execution of plush Santas and elves. Bodies hang limply overhead every few meters, feet occasionally twitching in animatronic death, like a war crime perpetrated in a toy shop. Today's increasingly automated corporations don't understand mortality, Manfred thinks, as he passes a mother herding along her upset children. Their immortality is a drawback when dealing with the humans they graze on: They lack insight into one of the main factors that motivates the meat machines who feed them. Well, sooner or later we'll have to do something about that, he tells himself. The free media channels here are denser and more richly self-referential than anything he's seen in President Santorum's America. The accent's different, though. Luton, London's fourth satellite airport, speaks with an annoyingly bumptious twang, like Australian with a plum in its mouth. Hello, stranger! Is that a brain in your pocket or are you just pleased to think me? Ping Watford Informatics for the latest in cognitive modules and cheesy motion-picture references. He turns the corner and finds himself squeezed up against the wall between the baggage reclaim office and a crowd of drunken Belgian tractor-drag fans, while his left goggle is trying to urgently tell him something about the railway infrastructure of Columbia. The fans wear blue face paint and chant something that sounds ominously like the ancient British war cry, Wemberrrly, Wemberrrly, and they're dragging a gigantic virtual tractor totem through the webspace analogue of the arrivals hall. He takes the reclaim office instead. As he enters the baggage reclaim zone, his jacket stiffens, and his glasses dim: He can hear the lost souls of suitcases crying for their owners. The eerie keening sets his own accessories on edge with a sense of loss, and for a moment, he's so spooked that he nearly shuts down the thalamic–limbic shunt interface that lets him feel their emotions. He's not in favor of emotions right now, not with the messy divorce proceedings and the blood sacrifice Pam is trying to extract from him; he'd much rather love and loss and hate had never been invented. But he needs the maximum possible sensory bandwidth to keep in touch with the world, so he feels it in his guts every time his footwear takes a shine to some Moldovan pyramid scheme. Shut up, he glyphs at his unruly herd of agents; I can't even hear myself think! \"Hello, sir, have a nice day, how may I be of service?\" the yellow plastic suitcase on the counter says chirpily. It doesn't fool Manfred: He can see the Stalinist lines of control chaining it to the sinister, faceless cash register that lurks below the desk, agent of the British Airport Authority corporate bureaucracy. But that's okay. Only bags need fear for their freedom in here. \"Just looking,\" he mumbles. And it's true. Because of a not entirely accidental cryptographic routing feature embedded in an airline reservations server, his suitcase is on its way to Mombasa, where it will probably be pithed and resurrected in the service of some African cyber-Fagin. That's okay by Manfred – it only contains a statistically normal mixture of second hand clothes and toiletries, and he only carries it to convince the airline passenger-profiling expert systems that he isn't some sort of deviant or terrorist – but it leaves him with a gap in his inventory that he must fill before he leaves the EU zone. He needs to pick up a replacement suitcase so that he has as much luggage leaving the superpower as he had when he entered it: He doesn't want to be accused of trafficking in physical goods in the midst of the transatlantic trade war between new world protectionists and old world globalists. At least, that's his cover story – and he's sticking to it. There's a row of unclaimed bags in front of the counter, up for sale in the absence of their owners. Some of them are very battered, but among them is a rather good-quality suitcase with integral induction-charged rollers and a keen sense of loyalty: exactly the same model as his old one. He polls it and sees not just GPS, but a Galileo tracker, a gazetteer the size of an old-time storage area network, and an iron determination to follow its owner as far as the gates of hell if necessary. Plus the right distinctive scratch on the lower left side of the case. \"How much for just this one?\" he asks the bellwether on the desk. \"Ninety euros,\" it says placidly. Manfred sighs. \"You can do better than that.\" In the time it takes them to settle on seventy-five, the Hang Sen Index is down fourteen-point-one-six points, and what's left of NASDAQ climbs another two-point-one. \"Deal.\" Manfred spits some virtual cash at the brutal face of the cash register, and it unfetters the suitcase, unaware that Macx has paid a good bit more than seventy-five euros for the privilege of collecting this piece of baggage. Manfred bends down and faces the camera in its handle. \"Manfred Macx,\" he says quietly. \"Follow me.\" He feels the handle heat up as it imprints on his fingerprints, digital and phenotypic. Then he turns and walks out of the slave market, his new luggage rolling at his heels. * * * A short train journey later, Manfred checks into a hotel in Milton Keynes. He watches the sun set from his bedroom window, an occlusion of concrete cows blocking the horizon. The room is functional in an overly naturalistic kind of way, rattan and force-grown hardwood and hemp rugs concealing the support systems and concrete walls behind. He sits in a chair, gin and tonic at hand, absorbing the latest market news and grazing his multichannel feeds in parallel. His reputation is up two percent for no obvious reason today, he notices: Odd, that. When he pokes at it he discovers that everybody's reputation – everybody, that is, who has a publicly traded reputation – is up a bit. It's as if the distributed Internet reputation servers are feeling bullish about integrity. Maybe there's a global honesty bubble forming. Manfred frowns, then snaps his fingers. The suitcase rolls toward him. \"Who do you belong to?\" he asks. \"Manfred Macx,\" it replies, slightly bashfully. \"No, before me.\" \"I don't understand that question.\" He sighs. \"Open up.\" Latches whir and retract: The hard-shell lid rises toward him, and he looks inside to confirm the contents. The suitcase is full of noise. * * * Welcome to the early twenty-first century, human. It's night in Milton Keynes, sunrise in Hong Kong. Moore's Law rolls inexorably on, dragging humanity toward the uncertain future. The planets of the solar system have a combined mass of approximately 2 x 1027 kilograms. Around the world, laboring women produce forty-five thousand babies a day, representing 1023 MIPS of processing power. Also around the world, fab lines casually churn out thirty million microprocessors a day, representing 1023 MIPS. In another ten months, most of the MIPS being added to the solar system will be machine-hosted for the first time. About ten years after that, the solar system's installed processing power will nudge the critical 1 MIPS per gram threshold – one million instructions per second per gram of matter. After that, singularity – a vanishing point beyond which extrapolating progress becomes meaningless. The time remaining before the intelligence spike is down to single-digit years ... * * * Aineko curls on the pillow beside Manfred's head, purring softly as his owner dreams uneasily. The night outside is dark: Vehicles operate on autopilot, running lights dipped to let the Milky Way shine down upon the sleeping city. Their quiet, fuel-cell-powered engines do not trouble Manfred's sleep. The robot cat keeps sleepless watch, alert for intruders, but there are none, save the whispering ghosts of Manfred's metacortex, feeding his dreams with their state vectors. The metacortex – a distributed cloud of software agents that surrounds him in netspace, borrowing CPU cycles from convenient processors (such as his robot pet) – is as much a part of Manfred as the society of mind that occupies his skull; his thoughts migrate into it, spawning new agents to research new experiences, and at night, they return to roost and share their knowledge. While Manfred sleeps, he dreams of an alchemical marriage. She waits for him at the altar in a strapless black gown, the surgical instruments gleaming in her gloved hands. \"This won't hurt a bit,\" she explains as she adjusts the straps. \"I only want your genome – the extended phenotype can wait until ... later.\" Blood-red lips, licked: a kiss of steel, then she presents the income tax bill. There's nothing accidental about this dream. As he experiences it, microelectrodes in his hypothalamus trigger sensitive neurons. Revulsion and shame flood him at the sight of her face, the sense of his vulnerability. Manfred's metacortex, in order to facilitate his divorce, is trying to decondition his strange love. It has been working on him for weeks, but still he craves her whiplash touch, the humiliation of his wife's control, the sense of helpless rage at her unpayable taxes, demanded with interest. Aineko watches him from the pillow, purring continuously. Retractable claws knead the bedding, first one paw, then the next. Aineko is full of ancient feline wisdom that Pamela installed back when mistress and master were exchanging data and bodily fluids rather than legal documents. Aineko is more cat than robot, these days, thanks in part to her hobbyist's interest in feline neuroanatomy. Aineko knows that Manfred is experiencing nameless neurasthenic agonies, but really doesn't give a shit about that as long as the power supply is clean and there are no intruders. Aineko curls up and joins Manfred in sleep, dreaming of laser-guided mice. * * * Manfred is jolted awake by the hotel room phone shrilling for attention. \"Hello?\" he asks, fuzzily. \"Manfred Macx?\" It's a human voice, with a gravelly east coast accent. \"Yeah?\" Manfred struggles to sit up. His mouth feels like the inside of a tomb, and his eyes don't want to open. \"My name is Alan Glashwiecz, of Smoot, Sedgwick Associates. Am I correct in thinking that you are the Manfred Macx who is a director of a company called, uh, agalmic dot holdings dot root dot one-eight-four dot ninety-seven dot A-for-able dot B-for-baker dot five, incorporated?\" \"Uh.\" Manfred blinks and rubs his eyes. \"Hold on a moment.\" When the retinal patterns fade, he pulls on his glasses and powers them up. \"Just a second now.\" Browsers and menus ricochet through his sleep-laden eyes. \"Can you repeat the company name?\" \"Sure.\" Glashwiecz repeats himself patiently. He sounds as tired as Manfred feels. \"Um.\" Manfred finds it, floating three tiers down an elaborate object hierarchy. It's flashing for attention. There's a priority interrupt, an incoming lawsuit that hasn't propagated up the inheritance tree yet. He prods at the object with a property browser. \"I'm afraid I'm not a director of that company, Mr. Glashwiecz. I appear to be retained by it as a technical contractor with non-executive power, reporting to the president, but frankly, this is the first time I've ever heard of the company. However, I can tell you who's in charge if you want.\" \"Yes?\" The attorney sounds almost interested. Manfred figures it out; the guy's in New Jersey, it must be about three in the morning over there. Malice – revenge for waking him up – sharpens Manfred's voice. \"The president of agalmic.holdings.root.184.97.AB5 is agalmic.holdings.root.184.97.201. The secretary is agalmic.holdings.root.184.D5, and the chair is agalmic.holdings.root.184.E8.FF. All the shares are owned by those companies in equal measure, and I can tell you that their regulations are written in Python. Have a nice day, now!\" He thumps the bedside phone control and sits up, yawning, then pushes the do-not-disturb button before it can interrupt again. After a moment he stands up and stretches, then heads to the bathroom to brush his teeth, comb his hair, and figure out where the lawsuit originated and how a human being managed to get far enough through his web of robot companies to bug him. * * * While he's having breakfast in the hotel restaurant, Manfred decides that he's going to do something unusual for a change: He's going to make himself temporarily rich. This is a change because Manfred's normal profession is making other people rich. Manfred doesn't believe in scarcity or zero-sum games or competition – his world is too fast and information-dense to accommodate primate hierarchy games. However, his current situation calls for him to do something radical: something like making himself a temporary billionaire so he can blow off his divorce settlement in an instant, like a wily accountancy octopus escaping a predator by vanishing in a cloud of his own black ink. Pam is chasing him partially for ideological reasons – she still hasn't given up on the idea of government as the dominant superorganism of the age – but also because she loves him in her own peculiar way, and the last thing any self-respecting dom can tolerate is rejection by her slave. Pam is a born-again postconservative, a member of the first generation to grow up after the end of the American century. Driven by the need to fix the decaying federal system before it collapses under a mound of Medicare bills, overseas adventurism, and decaying infrastructure, she's willing to use self-denial, entrapment, predatory mercantilism, dirty tricks, and any other tool that boosts the bottom line. She doesn't approve of Manfred's jetting around the world on free airline passes, making strangers rich, somehow never needing money. She can see his listing on the reputation servers, hovering about thirty points above IBM: All the metrics of integrity, effectiveness and goodwill value him above even that most fundamentalist of open-source computer companies. And she knows he craves her tough love, wants to give himself to her completely. So why is he running away? The reason he's running away is entirely more ordinary. Their unborn daughter, frozen in liquid nitrogen, is an unimplanted 96-hour-old blastula. Pam's bought into the whole Parents for Traditional Children parasite meme. PTC are germ-line recombination refuseniks: They refuse to have their children screened for fixable errors. If there's one thing that Manfred really can't cope with, it's the idea that nature knows best – even though that isn't the point she's making. One steaming row too many, and he kicked back, off to traveling fast and footloose again, spinning off new ideas like a memetic dynamo and living on the largesse of the new paradigm. File for divorce on grounds of irreconcilable ideological differences. No more whiplash-and-leather sex. * * * Before he hits the TGV for Rome, Manfred takes time to visit a model airplane show. It's a good place to be picked up by a CIA stringer – he's had a tip-off that someone will be there – and besides, flying models are hot hacker shit this decade. Add microtechnology, cameras, and neural networks to balsa-wood flyers, and you've got the next generation of military stealth flyer: It's a fertile talent-show scene, like the hacker cons of yore. This particular gig is happening in a decaying out-of-town supermarket that rents out its shop floor for events like this. Its emptiness is a sign of the times, ubiquitous broadband and expensive gas. (The robotized warehouse next door is, in contrast, frenetically busy, packing parcels for home delivery. Whether they telecommute or herd in meatspace offices, people still need to eat.) Today, the food hall is full of people. Eldritch ersatz insects buzz menacingly along the shining empty meat counters without fear of electrocution. Big monitors unfurled above the deli display cabinets show a weird, jerky view of a three-dimensional nightmare, painted all the synthetic colors of radar. The feminine-hygiene galley has been wheeled back to make room for a gigantic plastic-shrouded tampon five meters long and sixty centimeters in diameter – a microsat launcher and conference display, plonked there by the show's sponsors in a transparent attempt to talent-spot the up-and-coming engineering geeks. Manfred's glasses zoom in and grab a particularly fetching Fokker triplane that buzzes at face height through the crowd: He pipes the image stream up to one of his websites in real time. The Fokker pulls up in a tight Immelman turn beneath the dust-shrouded pneumatic cash tubes that line the ceiling, then picks up the trail of an F-104G. Cold War Luftwaffe and Great War Luftwaffe dart across the sky in an intricate game of tag. Manfred's so busy tracking the warbirds that he nearly trips over the fat white tube's launcher-erector. \"Eh, Manfred! More care, s'il vous plait!\" He wipes the planes and glances round. \"Do I know you?\" he asks politely, even as he feels a shock of recognition. \"Amsterdam, three years ago.\" The woman in the double-breasted suit raises an eyebrow at him, and his social secretary remembers her for him, whispers in his ear. \"Annette from Arianespace marketing?\" She nods, and he focuses on her. Still dressing in the last-century retro mode that confused him the first time they met, she looks like a Kennedy-era Secret Service man: cropped bleached crew cut like an angry albino hedgehog, pale blue contact lenses, black tie, narrow lapels. Only her skin color hints at her Berber ancestry. Her earrings are cameras, endlessly watching. Her raised eyebrow turns into a lopsided smile as she sees his reaction. \"I remember. That cafe in Amsterdam. What brings you here?\" \"Why \"– her wave takes in the entirety of the show – \"this talent show, of course.\" An elegant shrug and a wave at the orbit-capable tampon. \"It's good talent. We're hiring this year. If we re-enter the launcher market, we must employ only the best. Amateurs, not time-servers, engineers who can match the very best Singapore can offer.\" For the first time, Manfred notices the discreet corporate logo on the flank of the booster. \"You outsourced your launch-vehicle fabrication?\" Annette pulls a face as she explains with forced casualness: \"Space hotels were more profitable, this past decade. The high-ups, they cannot be bothered with the rocketry, no? Things that go fast and explode, they are passé, they say. Diversify, they say. Until –\" She gives a very Gallic shrug. Manfred nods; her earrings are recording everything she says, for the purposes of due diligence. \"I'm glad to see Europe re-entering the launcher business,\" he says seriously. \"It's going to be very important when the nanosystems conformational replication business gets going for real. A major strategic asset to any corporate entity in the field, even a hotel chain.\" Especially now they've wound up NASA and the moon race is down to China and India, he thinks sourly. Her laugh sounds like glass bells chiming. \"And yourself, mon cher? What brings you to the Confederaçion? You must have a deal in mind.\" \"Well., it's Manfred's turn to shrug, \"I was hoping to find a CIA agent, but there don't seem to be any here today.\" \"That is not surprising,\" Annette says resentfully. \"The CIA thinks the space industry, she is dead. Fools!\" She continues for a minute, enumerating the many shortcomings of the Central Intelligence Agency with vigor and a distinctly Parisian rudeness. \"They are become almost as bad as AP and Reuters since they go public,\" she adds. \"All these wire services! And they are, ah, stingy. The CIA does not understand that good news must be paid for at market rates if freelance stringers are to survive. They are to be laughed at. It is so easy to plant disinformation on them, almost as easy as the Office of Special Plans...\" She makes a banknote-riffling gesture between fingers and thumb. By way of punctuation, a remarkably maneuverable miniature ornithopter swoops around her head, does a double-back flip, and dives off in the direction of the liquor display. An Iranian woman wearing a backless leather minidress and a nearly transparent scarf barges up and demands to know how much the microbooster costs to buy: She is dissatisfied with Annette's attempt to direct her to the manufacturer's website, and Annette looks distinctly flustered by the time the woman's boyfriend – a dashing young air force pilot – shows up to escort her away. \"Tourists,\" she mutters, before noticing Manfred, who is staring off into space with fingers twitching. \"Manfred?\" \"Uh – what?\" \"I have been on this shop floor for six hours, and my feet, they kill me.\" She takes hold of his left arm and very deliberately unhooks her earrings, turning them off. \"If I say to you I can write for the CIA wire service, will you take me to a restaurant and buy me dinner and tell me what it is you want to say?\" * * * Welcome to the second decade of the twenty-first century; the second decade in human history when the intelligence of the environment has shown signs of rising to match human demand. The news from around the world is distinctly depressing this evening. In Maine, guerrillas affiliated with Parents for Traditional Children announce they've planted logic bombs in antenatal-clinic gene scanners, making them give random false positives when checking for hereditary disorders: The damage so far is six illegal abortions and fourteen lawsuits. The International Convention on Performing Rights is holding a third round of crisis talks in an attempt to stave off the final collapse of the WIPO music licensing regime. On the one hand, hard-liners representing the Copyright Control Association of America are pressing for restrictions on duplicating the altered emotional states associated with specific media performances: As a demonstration that they mean business, two \"software engineers\" in California have been kneecapped, tarred, feathered, and left for dead under placards accusing them of reverse-engineering movie plot lines using avatars of dead and out-of-copyright stars. On the opposite side of the fence, the Association of Free Artists are demanding the right of perform music in public without a recording contract, and are denouncing the CCAA as being a tool of Mafiya apparachiks who have bought it from the moribund music industry in an attempt to go legit. FBI Director Leonid Kuibyshev responds by denying that the Mafiya is a significant presence in the United States. But the music biz's position isn't strengthened by the near collapse of the legitimate American entertainment industry, which has been accelerating ever since the nasty noughties. A marginally intelligent voicemail virus masquerading as an IRS auditor has caused havoc throughout America, garnishing an estimated eighty billion dollars in confiscatory tax withholdings into a numbered Swiss bank account. A different virus is busy hijacking people's bank accounts, sending ten percent of their assets to the previous victim, then mailing itself to everyone in the current mark's address book: a self- propelled pyramid scheme in action. Oddly, nobody is complaining much. While the mess is being sorted out, business IT departments have gone to standby, refusing to process any transaction that doesn't come in the shape of ink on dead trees. Tipsters are warning of an impending readjustment in the overinflated reputations market, following revelations that some u-media gurus have been hyped past all realistic levels of credibility. The consequent damage to the junk-bonds market in integrity is serious. The EU council of independent heads of state has denied plans for another attempt at Eurofederalisme, at least until the economy rises out of its current slump. Three extinct species have been resurrected in the past month; unfortunately, endangered ones are now dying off at a rate of one a day. And a group of militant anti-GM campaigners are being pursued by Interpol, after their announcement that they have spliced a metabolic pathway for cyanogenic glycosides into maize seed corn destined for human-edible crops. There have been no deaths yet, but having to test breakfast cereal for cyanide is really going to dent consumer trust. About the only people who're doing well right now are the uploaded lobsters – and the crusties aren't even remotely human. * * * Manfred and Annette eat on the top deck of the buffet car, chatting as their TGV barrels through a tunnel under the English Channel. Annette, it transpires, has been commuting daily from Paris; which was, in any case, Manfred's next destination. From the show, he messaged Aineko to round up his baggage and meet him at St. Pancras Station, in a terminal like the shell of a giant steel woodlouse. Annette left her space launcher in the supermarket overnight: an unfueled test article, it is of no security significance. The railway buffet car is run by a Nepalese fast-food franchise. \"I sometimes wish for to stay on the train,\" Annette says as she waits for her mismas bhat. \"Past Paris! Think.

Russia is one of those places that still requires passports and asks if you are now or ever have been an anti-anticommunist: It's still trapped by its bloody-handed history.

Nothing that could get me fired.\" Manfred nods. \"My wife has access to their unfiltered stream.\" \"Your –\" Annette pauses. \"It was she who I, I met? In De Wildemann's?\" She sees his expression. \"Oh, my poor fool!\" She raises her glass to him. \"It is, has, not gone well?\" Manfred sighs and raises a toast toward Annette. \"You know your marriage is in a bad way when you send your spouse messages via the CIA, and she communicates using the IRS.\" \"In only five years.\" Annette winces. \"You will pardon me for saying this – she did not look like your type.\" There's a question hidden behind that statement, and he notices again how good she is at overloading her statements with subtexts. \"I'm not sure what my type is,\" he says, half-truthfully. He can't elude the sense that something not of either of their doing went wrong between him and Pamela, a subtle intrusion that levered them apart by stealth. Maybe it was me, he thinks. Sometimes he isn't certain he's still human; too many threads of his consciousness seem to live outside his head, reporting back whenever they find something interesting. Sometimes he feels like a puppet, and that frightens him because it's one of the early-warning signs of schizophrenia. And it's too early for anyone out there to be trying to hack exocortices ... isn't it? Right now, the external threads of his consciousness are telling him that they like Annette, when she's being herself instead of a cog in the meatspace ensemble of Arianespace management. But the part of him that's still human isn't sure just how far to trust himself. \"I want to be me. What do you want to be?\" She shrugs, as a waiter slides a plate in front of her. \"I'm just a, a Parisian babe, no? An ingénue raised in the lilac age of le Confederaçion Europé, the self-deconstructed ruins of the gilded European Union.\" \"Yeah, right.\" A plate appears in front of Manfred. \"And I'm a good old microboomer from the MassPike corridor.\" He peels back a corner of the omelet topping and inspects the food underneath it. \"Born in the sunset years of the American century.\" He pokes at one of the unidentifiable meaty lumps in the fried rice with his fork, and it pokes right back. There's a limit to how much his agents can tell him about her – European privacy laws are draconian by American standards – but he knows the essentials.

I can have got the wrong impression of course, but it didn't meet my taste. reply shadowgovt 3 hours agoparentI can see that. Having read several of Stross's works, this is one of the ones that's less \"gelled.\" I'd call it, structurally, an outlier relative to his other stuff; it's going a lot of places very fast and not leaving much time for the reader to get on the same page as the author. Very compelling for the concepts it raises and plays with, but his other works do a better job of telling a story. reply speed_spread 7 hours agoparentprevMy perception when I tried to read it was that it was just getting off it's own word soup, like I caught the author in a feverish and very private session with himself. Being somewhat traumatized, I haven't tried anything else by Stross since then. I like density but at some point, you gotta tell a story. It was obviously a secondary objective in that case. reply throwanem 27 minutes agorootparentThat's a deliberate technique in prose pacing, especially common in cyberpunk and allied sf subgenres. The basic insight is that prose which reads faster with less complexity feels faster, as if the events it describes occur at like pace. That's why a skillful writer rarely brings an adverb to a gunfight. It's also why clubs don't play melody-heavy stuff at 60 BPM, or even the liveliest among Mozart's string quartets. The variation here discussed modifies that approach by increasing the pace and not reducing the complexity. The intended effect is more or less as you describe: to dislocate the reader among ideas and concepts that seem to flow too fast to grasp. Given what the text seeks to express in this way, the technique fits perfectly. (The novel's not called Accelerando for nothing! If you aren't familiar with that word, now may be an unusually enlightening time to become so.) Granted, it doesn't sit the same with every reader. But it is very much the product of deliberate design, not mania, and deserves to be understood as such. (To be clear, I don't like Accelerando; with one exception I judge it the weakest of Stross's work, and it's very unreflective of his later work with a more practiced hand. But that I don't appreciate the work isn't the same as saying no respect is due the skill and artifice that went into its making - it's a piece I don't enjoy, but not a piece that's bad.) reply rkachowski 4 hours agorootparentprevwhat were the terms and examples that feel like word soup? it has been quite a while since i read it, but i remember the ideas being quite self consistent (with some serious sci-fi conceit of course) reply speed_spread 4 hours agorootparentI don't remember a specific word or sentence being problematic, just a general torrent-of-consciousness from someone else that prevented my own brain from forming images and putting things together as I read.

Fortunately, I don't think it really has an analogue in the modern day (other than, perhaps, \"when you have the capacity to craft culture, the culture you craft around you will become self-reinforcing\"). reply sangnoir 2 hours agorootparent> Fortunately, I don't think it really has an analogue in the modern day How about conglomerates having defense contractor and mass media/news subsidiaries?

Think of 1984 as a classic example, though good writing rescues that one as art. If the author hadn’t included a “Hannibal Lecture” from the party boss about what The Party actually was there would be trads and neoreactionaries praising it as a work about how great it is to have a state that provides meaning. If you don’t do that you get people who think for example that Paul Atraides in Dune is Luke Skywalker and the monopolistic feudal system is good when he’s more of a tragic villain in a dystopia. People even think the world backdrop of Neuromancer is cool. That would not be a cool place to live.

We are reduced to the street life that William Gibson saw in the downtown East side of Vancouver while the machines take over. reply 0xEF 10 hours agorootparentLike you, I find that sci-fi and its derivatives is where many readers often miss the point. It's not a overly \"happy ending\" genre, which I think is important to provide balance to all the literary genres as a whole, since many of them aren't exactly trying to make the reader depressed. That's not so much the goal of sci-fi authors either, but instead to make the readers think, which, yes can and often does drive is into the darker parts of what society, humanity and existence has to offer. It's important to have a functional place to approach these things, in my opinion, which is why I shy away from the utopia/optimistic stuff in the genre that rarely seems to gain the popularity the more darkly speculative and dystopian stuff does. It's not for everyone, I guess. But it should be. Your 1984 example is fantastic since we are seeing this exact thing play out in US politics today, with a tyrannical group trying to usher in a police state and the sycophants that walk lock-step right along with it, enamored by the delusion that they are the good guys because their demagogues don't explicitly say the quiet part out loud. reply XorNot 8 hours agorootparentprevWilliam Gibson would object to the notion that the Sprawl is a dystopia though - at least not directly as one.

    "originBody": "Research AlphaProteo generates novel proteins for biology and health research Published 5 September 2024 Authors Protein Design and Wet Lab teams Share New AI system designs proteins that successfully bind to target molecules, with potential for advancing drug design, disease understanding and more. Every biological process in the body, from cell growth to immune responses, depends on interactions between molecules called proteins. Like a key to a lock, one protein can bind to another, helping regulate critical cellular processes. Protein structure prediction tools like AlphaFold have already given us tremendous insight into how proteins interact with each other to perform their functions, but these tools cannot create new proteins to directly manipulate those interactions. Scientists, however, can create novel proteins that successfully bind to target molecules. These binders can help researchers accelerate progress across a broad spectrum of research, including drug development, cell and tissue imaging, disease understanding and diagnosis – even crop resistance to pests. While recent machine learning approaches to protein design have made great strides, the process is still laborious and requires extensive experimental testing. Today, we introduce AlphaProteo, our first AI system for designing novel, high-strength protein binders to serve as building blocks for biological and health research. This technology has the potential to accelerate our understanding of biological processes, and aid the discovery of new drugs, the development of biosensors and more. AlphaProteo can generate new protein binders for diverse target proteins, including VEGF-A, which is associated with cancer and complications from diabetes. This is the first time an AI tool has been able to design a successful protein binder for VEGF-A. AlphaProteo also achieves higher experimental success rates and 3 to 300 times better binding affinities than the best existing methods on seven target proteins we tested. Learning the intricate ways proteins bind to each other Protein binders that can bind tightly to a target protein are hard to design. Traditional methods are time intensive, requiring multiple rounds of extensive lab work. After the binders are created, they undergo additional experimental rounds to optimize binding affinity, so they bind tightly enough to be useful. Trained on vast amounts of protein data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and more than 100 million predicted structures from AlphaFold, AlphaProteo has learned the myriad ways molecules bind to each other. Given the structure of a target molecule and a set of preferred binding locations on that molecule, AlphaProteo generates a candidate protein that binds to the target at those locations. Pause Play Illustration of a predicted protein binder structure interacting with a target protein. Shown in blue is a predicted protein binder structure generated by AlphaProteo, designed for binding to a target protein. Shown in yellow is the target protein, specifically the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain Demonstrating success on important protein binding targets To test AlphaProteo, we designed binders for diverse target proteins, including two viral proteins involved in infection, BHRF1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain, SC2RBD, and five proteins involved in cancer, inflammation and autoimmune diseases, IL-7Rɑ, PD-L1, TrkA, IL-17A and VEGF-A. Our system has highly-competitive binding success rates and best-in-class binding strengths. For seven targets, AlphaProteo generated candidate proteins in-silico that bound strongly to their intended proteins when tested experimentally. A grid of illustrations of predicted structures of seven target proteins for which AlphaProteo generated successful binders. Shown in blue are examples of binders tested in the wet lab, shown in yellow are protein targets, and highlighted in dark yellow are intended binding regions. For one particular target, the viral protein BHRF1, 88% of our candidate molecules bound successfully when tested in the Google DeepMind Wet Lab. Based on the targets tested, AlphaProteo binders also bind 10 times more strongly, on average, than the best existing design methods. For another target, TrkA, our binders are even stronger than the best prior designed binders to this target that have been through multiple rounds of experimental optimization. Bar graph showing experimental in vitro success rates of AlphaProteo’s output for each of the seven target proteins, compared to other design methods. Higher success rates mean fewer designs must be tested to find successful binders. Bar graph showing the best affinity for AlphaProteo’s designs without experimental optimization for each of the seven target proteins, compared to other design methods. Lower affinity means the binder protein binds more tightly to the target protein. Please note the logarithmic scale of the vertical axis. Validating our results Beyond in silico validation and testing AlphaProteo in our wet lab, we engaged Peter Cherepanov’s, Katie Bentley’s and David LV Bauer’s research groups from the Francis Crick Institute to validate our protein binders. Across different experiments, they dived deeper into some of our stronger SC2RBD and VEGF-A binders. The research groups confirmed that the binding interactions of these binders were indeed similar to what AlphaProteo had predicted. Additionally, the groups confirmed that the binders have useful biological function. For example, some of our SC2RBD binders were shown to prevent SARS-CoV-2 and some of its variants from infecting cells. AlphaProteo’s performance indicates that it could drastically reduce the time needed for initial experiments involving protein binders for a broad range of applications. However, we know that our AI system has limitations, as it was unable to design successful binders against an 8th target, TNFɑ, a protein associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. We selected TNFɑ to robustly challenge AlphaProteo, as computational analysis showed that it would be extremely difficult to design binders against. We will continue to improve and expand AlphaProteo's capabilities with the goal of eventually addressing such challenging targets. Achieving strong binding is usually only the first step in designing proteins that might be useful for practical applications, and there are many more bioengineering obstacles to overcome in the research and development process. Towards responsible development of protein design Protein design is a fast-evolving technology that holds lots of potential for advancing science in everything from understanding the factors that cause disease, to accelerating diagnostic test development for virus outbreaks, supporting more sustainable manufacturing processes, and even cleaning contaminants from the environment. To account for potential risks in biosecurity, building on our long-standing approach to responsibility and safety, we’re working with leading external experts to inform our phased approach to sharing this work, and feeding into community efforts to develop best practices, including the NTI’s (Nuclear Threat Initiative) new AI Bio Forum. Going forward, we’ll be working with the scientific community to leverage AlphaProteo on impactful biology problems and understand its limitations. We've also been exploring its drug design applications at Isomorphic Labs, and are excited for what the future holds. At the same time, we’re continuing to improve the success rate and affinity of AlphaProteo’s algorithms, expanding the range of design problems it can tackle, and working with researchers in machine learning, structural biology, biochemistry and other disciplines to develop a responsible and more comprehensive protein design offering for the community.

Are they using it to develop new drugs themselves? Or licensing it to the pharmaceutical industry? reply dekhn 1 hour agoparentIIUC most of the commercialization is done through Isomorphic (https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/). My guess is that Google Research/DM itself wants to stay at the front of the field rather than develop drugs (of which protein design is really just a tiny contribution). When I worked at Google I made a case for doing protein design/preliminary drug discovery using Google infrastructure and it was well received by the leadership. The leadership at Google is mostly computer scientists who know about, but can't actually do, leading-edge life sciences research, and they want to contribute some amount of Google's resources to advancing the state of the art. That's the only reason exacycle was permitted- because Urs thought we could maybe help save the world with protein design (and it wasn't a good approach because it wasted enormous amounts of power on unbiased sampling of large proteins). Honestly I don't think Google proper is really a good place for this work to be applied, though. Their attention is easily diverted, they repeatedly fail to commercialize, and most importantly, potential partners are scared Google will steal their data, and replace their business. reply rty32 1 hour agorootparentI wonder why things seem to work well with Waymo?

Can tools like this potentially create protein structures that specifically bind in certain cells? Or is this more about a way of being able to create proteins for genes / structures we haven't been able to before? I'm very interested in my research at the moment in pleiotropy, namely mapping pleiotropic effects in as many *omics/QTL measurements and complex traits as possible. This is really helpful for determining which genes / proteins to focus on for drug development. The problem with drugs is in fact pleiotropy! A single protein can do quite a lot of things in your body, either through a causal downstream mechanism (vertical pleiotropy), or seemingly independent processes (horizontal). This limits a lot of possible drug target as the side-effect / detrimental effect may be too large. So, if these tools can create ultra specific protein structures that somehow only bind in the areas of interest, then that would be a truly massive breakthrough. reply Pulcinella 2 hours agoparentFor anyone who would like to know more about designing proteins with a certain function, target, or structure in mind, the term to search for is \"rational design.\" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_design reply loopdoend 1 hour agorootparentThank you for this, terms of art are the silent gatekeepers... reply elmomle 5 minutes agorootparentAs an aside, learning the precise terms for concepts in fields in which I'm a layperson (or simply have some cobwebs to shake loose)--and then exploring those terms more--is something that I've found LLMs extraordinarily useful for. reply ampdepolymerase 1 hour agorootparentprevAlso \"off target effects\". reply highfrequency 1 hour agoparentprevNot an expert, but you could imagine a protein with two receptors that are required for activation. One of them binds to a protein that is only present in the cells of interest, and the other one binds to the actual target. reply UniverseHacker 2 hours agoparentprevYes, in principle but there are huge limitations and challenges to using a protein as a drug in living organisms. It has to be injected to avoid digestion, and a protein can't just pass into a cell, it needs to get in somehow. Current peptide drugs like insulin are identical to, or closely mimic natural small peptide hormones that bind to receptors on the outside of a cell. However, there is a possibility of using gene therapy to directly express a novel protein drug inside of the cell. A novel protein is also likely to trigger an immune response- so that type of gene therapy is mostly useful when that is actually desired, e.g. as a vaccine. reply eig 3 hours agoprevMaybe this is in the supplement of the whitepaper [0], but I would have loved to see more analysis of how novel the designed proteins really are. In the whitepaper they mention that they are novel compared to other in silico design techniques, but to my knowledge other binders to VEGF and Covid spike protein exist and would already be found in the PDB database that Deepmind trained the model on. This is not to minimize the results- if the history of ML is anything to go by, even if AlphaProteo does not currently beat the best affinity found by in vitro screens, I do not doubt that it soon will! [0] - https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/B... reply gilleain 1 hour agoparentMight depend on what your measure of 'novelty' is in protein structure. A single residue change (for example) would not normally be considered a novel structure - it's just a mutation. However, a new fold - that is, the shape that the backbone folds into - would be novel. Potentially also novel would be 'chimeric' structures with parts from other structures, as with chimeric domain swaps.

If the proteins suggested in this paper are very similar to known good binders in PDB then I am much less impressed by the results. You could argue they are generating a structure from the training set. I want more info about how novel these proteins are. reply vessenes 2 hours agoparentprevThey must be somewhat novel in that the wet lab work verified up to 10x stronger binding as predicted. I agree it would be interesting to see how they compare to known binding proteins reply dekhn 2 hours agorootparentwe've been able to design tight binders for quite some time now- the issue with synthetic designs is that they tend to bind a little too tightly. You want to have a reasonable off-rate and the ligand protein should do more than just bind, it needs to effect some sort of response from the bound protein. When you look at these synthetics they often maximize for interactions of hydrophobic areas on the surface. reply letitgo12345 1 hour agoprevOne question is how specific the binding is -- what's the level of off-target effects, etc. reply Improvement 1 hour agoprevI am sorry for my naivety, but what is the practical benefits of this? reply space_fountain 49 minutes agoparentIt varies, but as the article says it can be used for things like drug discovery. Imagine there's a new virus running rampant. It works by using a very specific protein to latch onto a cells so it can pull itself in. You would like to develop a drug to stop it doing that and one way to do that is to find a protein that wants to strongly latch on to an important part of the virus. If it's holding onto the virus the virus probably won't be able to penetrate cells because you're engineered protein will get in the way. This is part of how antibodies work to stop viral infections naturally reply photochemsyn 2 hours agoprevInteresting work, but there's a huge sector they're missing - industrial enzyme and catalysis design. Most of this field is concerned with small molecule binding - methane, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methanol, acetic acid, etc. Binding is often just the first step, as you're typically trying to do highly specific chemistry, e.g. attaching a single oxygen to methane or a single hydrogen to carbon dioxide, etc. Working in this area might also be good test of their technological approach, as small-molecule binding can be somewhat challenging, and even evolved biological systems can struggle to achieve high specificity. reply ray__ 22 minutes agoparentMy guess is that this area is much harder to break into–enzymes facilitate challenging chemical transformations by stabilizing high-energy transition states in chemical reactions. These states are usually highly transient and therefore much harder to capture using the structural biology techniques that generate the structural data that AlphaFold and similar methods are trained on. Even though there are many structures of enzymes in the absence of their substrate, I would imagine that the small number of structures for states that represent actual catalytic intermediates would make it difficult for a model to internalize the features that distinguish a good enzyme/catalyst from a bad one. Another consideration is that most protein structure prediction methods only generate the backbone, and the sidechains are modeled in afterwards. Enzyme efficiency requires sub-A level structural precision in the sidechains that are actually doing the chemistry involved in catalysis, so it could also be the case that the current backbone-centric methods aren't good enough to predict these fine-tuned interactions. reply dekhn 49 minutes agoparentprevI want to mention an interesting industrial enzyme project. If you ever saw the laundry detergent commercial \"Protein gets out protein\", this is referring to an industrial enzyme in laundry detergent. Many years ago, Genentech had built up a significant capability in proteases, which are proteins that cut other proteins into pieces. In the course of optimizing proteases, they made a thermostable, thermoactive protease. Although it wasn't super useful for Genentech in a drug discovery context, it was recognized that you could put an inactive enzyme into laundry detergent that would be activated when the hot laundry water hit the detergent, and the resulting protease would be good at cleaning stains (many stains are composed of protein- blood, food, etc). Genentech set up a subsidiary with Corning (the glass company) that owns the IP for this protease and then licensed it to laundry detergent manufacturers; many billions of dollars in revenue.

    "commentBody": "Canadian mega landlord using AI 'pricing scheme' as it hikes rents (breachmedia.ca)132 points by mattm 17 hours agohidepastfavorite139 comments meeby 15 hours agoIt’s a shift in collective power. At the core of the issue is landlords communicating together to all set fixed high rents has been illegal for decades. This is collective rent fixing with an extra step. The “AI” here is just a buzzword, it’s masking a black box where many landlords pump in lots of data and a black box algorithm spits out higher rents. The issue occurs when a critical mass of landlords use the same service. The market readjusts from free market competition to the maximum the market can bear without collapsing, exactly what the anti-collusion laws were design to prevent. The economic drivers are reversed. Like generative AI for art, it doesn’t cleanly fit into any existing governance. I would assume new, and irritating complex, laws will be attempted to be written to control this development as it has more immediate real works impact than other forms of “AI”. reply beefnugs 14 hours agoparentThe only way to turn it into a real market, is some kind of collaboration software tools for renters or non-intimate partnerships to gang up. We need tools that arent making choices based on profit increase but humanitarian necessity (which is probably impossible) Tools such as : - finding people to share mortgages with, negotiating problems encountered with roomates, ways to re-shuffle roomates around to find better compatibility, incentives for being less of a dick and contributing to happier roomatism - collective action in an area such as purchasing cheap out of town space with lots of living area and \"roughing it\" for a while to put downward pressure on rent prices, maybe even negotiating particular prices to trigger a large number of renter signups ( no way this is legal, but it will get bad enough we are going to have to break some rules) - shared mortgage investment that is based upon agreed lower reasonable profit, or even money parking, instead of maximizing real estate profit (there has to be some philanthropes who would put there money into this?) - I hate to have to mention negative landlord tracking, but the worst of the worst gets away with so much shit, we need to come up as close to vigilantism we can get while not breaking laws. I foresee the need for tools where we can track exact letter of law harassment limits etc for the worst offenders who are getting away with too much uncaught illegal and immoral landlording reply another2another 4 hours agorootparentAnother way to turn it into a more competitive market is to introduce large competition in the form of not for profit housing co-ops where the coop buys to rent houses, renters have to buy into the coop, and all profits are put into either buying or building new houses. The coops keep their rents below that of the competition to attract new members, and can even reduce the rents after the initial outlay has been payed off. This would then create a number of large semi-altruistic competitors that would throw sand into the capitalistic machine and inhibit price gouging. reply bradlys 3 hours agorootparentOr just have public housing like many other countries do - which provides ample supply without any incentive structure to keep prices going up. Rent can be stabilized and prices can be low from the start to only cover costs. No need to pay for a half dozen middle men. reply pokerface_86 2 hours agorootparentmany cities have public housing. it’s filled with drug addicts, rapists, and people who will rob you for a mint. reply bradlys 1 hour agorootparent43 percent of people in Vienna are addicts, rapists, and thieves? https://archive.is/20240131194845/https://www.nytimes.com/20... reply rapind 7 hours agorootparentprevI kind of think long term you want government to build a healthy number of basic units. This is what Canada did after WW II (vet housing). Since then they pivoted to market manipulation w/ CMHC and I don’t think it worked out. I’m only a fan of government when it comes to universal programs though. You shouldn’t have to pass any gatekeepers, units should be available to everyone (billionaires too) but as 1 per and disallowed from renting etc. (non-investment, primary residence) Having a public option for housing could go a long way towards keeping a middle class. reply tdb7893 14 hours agoparentprevI had an argument with people the other day that it's not \"free\" as in unregulated markets that are good but \"free\" as in competitive ones. If you free a market from governmental influence but captured by private companies that don't meaningfully compete then it's also not free. reply noobermin 13 hours agorootparentThere really are few people nowadays who are for truly competitive markets, other than lay people. I feel like every large so-called probusiness group or politician really is for monopolistic corporate rule of life and the market, they only gesture towards the free market ethos as an ideological commitment but not one they really truly believe in. reply crooked-v 14 hours agoparentprevExactly. As with the ongoing RealPage case, all the 'algorithm' and 'AI' stuff is just a system designed to enable price collusion without landlords directly talking to each other. reply i-am-fnord 13 hours agorootparentIt's just like Uber, Airbnb, and the rest of the tech world. As it turns out most of the technology we've built doesn't really help people at all... we've given corporations new ways to collude or evade regulations causing immense harm to our society. All we've done is help companies break the law and get rich at the expense of the people. And our stupid governments won't even hold them accountable. reply tharmas 2 hours agorootparentThe tech behind Uber is fantastic. Its the way it was used that is nasty. Similarly with AirBnB. If AirBnB had restricted the use of its platform to people wanting to rent out a room in their house or their apartment it would have been much better. But I completely agree with you, a lot of the tech has been hugely detrimental to the public. And the government do no oversight. reply testfoobar 14 hours agoparentprevWhat if the largest landlords in a community just hired someone to canvas the city on a monthly basis and collect rental price data that way. In most markets, comparative pricing of other vendors is always a solid baseline for where to start pricing your product. Market intelligence is a critical part of any go to market strategy. Edit: Just to be clear, I think market collusion is anti-competitive. But where is the dividing line between market research and collusion? Clearly if landlords met in the back of a smoky bar the last sunday of every month to set rents - we'd call that collusion. But is such formal data sharing and price setting actually required to achieve the same effect - practically, landlords could just observe each other's rents to achieve a similar effect. Where should the law decide it is collusion? reply jjav 13 hours agorootparent> But where is the dividing line between market research and collusion? Scale and ubiquity make all the difference in the world even if it seems like the same public data. An example that comes to mind, different topic but somewhat analogous: cameras recording activity in public spaces. Some people argue there is nothing different happening today from decades ago because if you are doing activities in a public space anyone could record you just fine whether 50 years ago or today. But they are wrong, it is vastly different. Fifty years ago someone could record you in that public space, but the odds were infinitesimally small that someone actually did. And if they did, the odds of anyone else finding that video were smaller yet. Today with ubiquitous cameras everywhere recording everything all the time it's a near certainty that you are being recorded in public spaces. And with all that video going into \"the cloud\" and usually available to every government agency, it's all analyzed and indexed and thus searchable at a scale never before imaginable. Long-winded example to show that scale makes all the difference even if the underlying action is the same. Sure, some landlords have colluded with some others for centuries, but the ability for all of them to collude on every property real-time is a fundamental shift. reply anileated 11 hours agorootparentprevScale makes things different. You can hire people to scrape the Internet for artwork and then produce images in arbitrary styles (same for text), but you would need to constantly pay them wages (benefitting their lives, reducing unemployment, injecting money into the economy) and you can only do so much. If they become good enough they will just quit and live off freelance commissions. Similarly, if you hire low-paid people to canvas the city for rent prices, and yet more people to aggregate them without any ML, chances are one of them is renting and will raise the question with the authorities, and also why not just drop off to start own real estate agency with all that data. reply BigParm 11 hours agoparentprevCan workers do this with wages?

If rents are paid no matter what, you dont need AI to tell you to set it high. But we know rents arent limitless because ability to pay is not limitless. reply slg 15 hours agorootparent>Im not sure i understand how AI matters here. It says it right in the article's subtitle: >Software the U.S. government says is illegal gives landlords ability to coordinate rent hikes. The AI (in this instance \"AI\" just means \"a blackbox algorithm\") is basically an excuse to provide plausible deniability on market collusion. Combine this with the relatively inelastic nature of the demand for housing, it creates an avenue for abuse. Without the AI, you don't have collusion meaning increased competition will produce a lower and fairer market price. reply refurb 15 hours agorootparentBut the point stands. If rents are inelastic, you dont need collusion? You just charge as much as you want? reply slg 15 hours agorootparentThat is why I said \"relatively inelastic\". Raise the price too high and eventually you won't fill the unit because some other landlord will relent and stop raising their price in order to get their unit rented. This is basically the foundation of market theory.

Ahhh, ok, so why wouldn't this happen even with AI? Isn't the population of landlord's heterogenous?

So in that case, even with collusion, you'd have some landlord's undercutting other landlords? reply dools 15 hours agorootparentprevI think perhaps one of the issues might be that price hikes would be more readily co-ordinated across regions. As such, a system that knows it is putting up prices in an area from which people will likely move, can simultaneously recommend putting up prices in the area to which those people would otherwise have moved to escape higher prices. reply Chrisoaks 14 hours agorootparentprevNot true.

With urbanisation going up to 11 there are not many \"somewhere else cheap to live\" for many professions. People can't easily find a job at a place with lower rents because there's a reason it has lower rents: it's less desirable, has less opportunities, so on and so forth. For the privileged class of office workers with remote jobs that's an easy solution, and one that I see many peers taking over time, for the rest of society it's not feasible. If you were a theater actor (or teacher), you can't go live in the middle of nowhere, you won't have many peers, you won't have many venues, companies, etc. to work with.

While these do sound good in theory, they have (at least in Seattle) very rarely been used to actually protect the environment.

That part is mostly irrelevant to me. I’m unhappy about it because we need them to immigrate here because we’ve utterly failed to create a thriving, functional, sustainable, balanced economy with people who have legitimate means and incentives to participate in it across the board. This mass immigration strategy is a lifeline whether we like it or not. It’s not a good situation no matter how you slice it in my opinion, but I suspect things would be worse without immigration. I recently started a business and I’ve been completely blown away by how much it sucks in this country. The start up costs were reasonable until I discovered my type of business requires light industrial space to get a permit. I can’t get the permit to operate from my residence due to zoning, not because I want a store front or anything, but because I’d need to drain water more often than residential zones are allowed. I mean, someone who has a lot of baths will drain far more water than I’d need to, but whatever. I need to rent the space to operate. So I look around my city and discover this can cost around $100k per year for remarkably small spaces. Like, barely larger than my 2 car garage. The cheapest I found was $65k for what is essentially the same situation as my garage, but I’d be able to get the permit. It’s dirtier, far away from my home, only has 120V service, no internet, would need serious renovation to be suitable for basic lab work, etc. I thought I must be missing something and started digging into historical pricing. Around 15 years ago the same place was leased for 3 years at $15k per year. How are we supposed to build our economy in these conditions? Why would I take on that risk? I don’t want to build the next unicorn here; I just want to tissue culture some plants. I like it. It’s insane to bother doing it legitimately though. What a mess. Canada is failing to make entrepreneurship appealing or even sensible. Regular employment is becoming less rewarding for most people each year. As a result I think we’ve got a shrinking and relatively unmotivated workforce. Unless that were to change, we absolutely need to import labour to fill the gaps. It’s going to feel strange to live here in 20 years, I think. It won’t be the same.

This plus the standard developed country birth rate (i.e. low) but a lack of adequate infrastructure is now going to push Canada into anemic to negative economic and population growth. Think Japan without the infrastructure. Unless something is done to turn around this degrowth, and without immigrants to blame this time, Canada has nowhere to go but simply become America's little shrunken brother.

A census was performed in 2021, but I wouldn't trust its findings to be relevant. It was done in the middle of harsh government-imposed lockdowns and other severe disruptions throughout the whole country. A lot of foreigners who could temporarily leave Canada did so, and many foreign \"students\" and \"temporary workers\" delayed their arrivals. There has been a huge influx of foreigners since then, too. Unfortunately, we'll have to wait until 2026 for the next census and more recent data. This also isn't a subject that sees objective study in academic settings, either. I don't think that it would even be possible to study objectively in such a setting, given then the lucrative financial ties between foreign \"students\" and Canada's universities themselves. Any researcher daring to even consider the subject in an objective manner would likely face significant persecution from a variety of sources. For their own personal safety, it's a topic that most Canadians are not willing to openly and honestly discuss with people they don't know and trust, including academics, pollsters, and others engaging in data collection. Expressing the \"wrong\" opinion can easily result in various types of harassment and abuse, if not worse. The downvoting of deisteve's comment is an example of this in practice.

Modern Canada has not turned a \"blind eye\". I accept absolutely no blame, none, nada for a single thing any ancestor of mine has done. None. I am not responsible for anything my ancestors have done. The federal goverments covering multiple parties over the last few decades have poured money into settlements, investigating claims, resolving issues. I agree with settling claims if there was a contract, otherwise not. All over the planet, in every single country that exists, people are on \"other people's land\". There is not a single place free of this, anywhere. You only need go back far enough to discover \"someone else was here\". It should be noted that this also holds true for virtually all natives in Canada today. All took land from prior waves of settlers, and all warred against one another for land and resources. To somehow claim or believe that no war, to strife, to taking of others land occurred before that \"horrible horrible white man\" showed up is a fist full of lies. In terms of \"atrocities\", there has never been \"mass graves\" found in Canada, ever. Please differentiate between \"suspected\" and \"we've validated that suspicion\". It should be noted that for mass graves, there are federal funds given to native communities to investigate any such claims, millions being spent this very moment, yet again -- never, ever been found. The issues with the church abusing natives in the past is a sad, and indeed horrible event. Yet one must view this in the optics of ALL societies at this time. It was done with an intent to help, not hurt. Again, it was wrong, but the motive was not intended as such. And to put this in perspective, look at what happened to white Canadian children placed in the care of the church. Ever hear of priests raping young boys? Of orphanages beating young children? This happened to white people as well, and while none of it was right, to native or to white, my point is that it happened to us too. And if you think that's it, Google the \"home children\". An example being that my great-great grandfather died during WWI, resulting in his wife and children being without a provider. Mores being as they were back then, this meant the wife had two choices, put the children up for adoption, as they would all starve otherwise, and then remarry -- for no man would take another's children back then. This is how war heroes were treated in the early 20th. Thanks for your life, your wife and children are now screwed. Thus my grandfather was eventually shipped out indentured, which is on the edge of slavery, to Canada from the UK. My greatuncle was shipped to Australia. My great-aunts, unknown. To this day we have no idea where our family is in the world, or even if they survived. Some home children were treated atrociously, starving conditions, raped, beat, and more. To run meant the law would catch you and bring you back. My grandfather was \"lucky\", in that he was only worked 18 hours a day as a youth, and being a farm he had food. But that farmer bought my grandfather's contract, and had him until 18. You may say \"So what\", but my point here is this was the world of the time. And you may say that Canada is a horrible country, but from my perspective screw you. Look at the world today, where more than 1/2 of it are committing acts that are far, far more barbarous than anything done 100+ years ago in Canada. And for the last decades we've been working towards resolution. Canada is not perfect, but it a light of glowing enlightenment compared to the rest of the world. I'm sure you're going to come back with \"But, this happened!\" and yes some of it likely did. But is it happening today? Are you seriously trying to claim people aren't aware today?

The only kind of collusion that might break that law is if landlords are forced by the agreement not to lower rent to compete. It's really very simple: What's the vacancy rate?

The complaint states: > Across America, RealPage sells landlords commercial revenue management software. RealPage develops, markets, and sells this software to enable landlords to sidestep vigorous competition to win renters’ business. Landlords, who would otherwise be competing with each other, submit on a daily basis their competitively sensitive information to RealPage. This nonpublic, material, and granular rental data includes, among other information, a landlord’s rental prices from executed leases, lease terms, and future occupancy. RealPage collects a broad swath of such data from competing landlords, combines it, and feeds it to an algorithm. Based on this process and algorithm, RealPage provides daily, near realtime pricing “recommendations” back to competing landlords. These recommendations are based on the sensitive information of their rivals. But these are more than just “recommendations.” Because, in its own words, a “rising tide raises all ships,” RealPage monitors compliance by landlords to its recommendations. RealPage also reviews and weighs in on landlords’ other policies, including trying to—and often succeeding in— ending renter-friendly concessions (like a free month’s rent or waived fees) to attract or retain renters. A significant number of landlords then effectively agree to outsource their pricing function to RealPage with auto acceptance or other settings such that RealPage as a middleman, and not the free market, determines the price that a renter will pay. Competing landlords choose to share their information with RealPage to “eliminate the guessing game” about what their competitors are doing and ultimately take instructions from RealPage on how to make business decisions to “optimize”—or in reality, maximize—rents. reply ars 14 hours agorootparent> RealPage monitors compliance by landlords to its recommendations.

GNU sed actually provides pretty useful debugging interface, try it yourself with --debug flag. However the interface is not interactive and I wanted something closer to traditional debugger. I've written something here. Does it really work? Depends. Sed actually doesn't tell me which line number is it currently executing, so I have to emulate parts of sed to guess that. Which might not be bulletproof. But it certainly worked good enough to debug tetris without issues. Why sed?? Sed is the perfect programming language, especially for graph problems. It's plain and simple and doesn't clutter your screen with useless identifiers like if, for, while, or int. Furthermore since it doesn't have things like numbers, it's very simple to use. But why? I wanted to program in sed but it lacked good tooling up to this point, so I had to do something about it. Why? Because it's the standard stream editor for filtering and transforming text. And someone wrote tetris in it! What is the roadmap for future updates? I would like to introduce syntax highlighting and add this tool to standard repositories of all major distributions. Is this a joke? I thought it was. But apparently it's actually useful for some people.

And that's also what `sd` focuses on. Also, if you want to replace newlines, just use `tr`, to hook onto the examples of sd. It may seem annoying to use a different tool, but there are two major advantages: 1. you're learning about the existence, capabilities and limitations of more tools 2. both `sed` and `tr` are probably available in your next shitty embedded busybox-driven device, while `sd` probably is not As you said, the value comes from being around for a long time and, probably more importantly, still being present on nearly any Unix-like system. reply ta1243 1 hour agorootparentprev99% of the time I use sed to mangle the output of a text file into something else.

Though what's been a little frustrating is that there's anti scraping measures and they break things. But they're always trivial to get around, so it's just annoying. A big reason LLMs and up failing is that I need my scripts to work on osx and nix machines. So it's always suggesting things to me that work on one but not the other.

I’ve been working with *nix for 20 years but bash is so arcane and my needs always so immediate that I never did anything other than use it to run commands in sequence with maybe a $1 or a $2 in there reply WizardClickBoy 13 hours agoparentprev100% agree. I'm currently preparing several 10s of GBs of HTML in nested directories for static hosting via S3 and was floundering until Gippity recommended find + exec sed to me. I'm now batch fixing issues (think 'not enough \"../\" in 60000 relative hrefs in nested directories') with a single command rather than writing scripts and feel like a wizard. These tools are things I've used before but always found painful and confusing. Being able to ask Gippity for detailed explanations of what is happening, in particular being able to paste a failing command and have it explain what the problem is, has been a game changer. In general, for those of us who never had a command line wizard colleague or mentor to show what is possible, LLMs are an absolute game changer both in terms of recommending tools and showing how to use them. reply barrkel 9 hours agorootparentIf you have a lot of files, consider find piped to xargs with -P for parallelism and -n to limit the number of files per parallel invocation. Only a tiny bit more complex but often an order of magnitude faster with today's CPUs. Use -print0 on find with -0 on xargs to handle spaces in filenames correctly. GNU parallel is another step up, but xargs is generally always to hand. reply WizardClickBoy 8 hours agorootparentThanks! Gippity did suggest the xargs approach as an alternative, but I found that find [...] - exec [...] {} + as opposed to find [...] - exec [...] {} \\; worked fine and was performant enough for my use-case. An example command was find . -type f -name \"*.html\" -exec sed -i '' -e 's/\\.\\.\\/\\.\\.\\/\\.\\.\\//\\.\\.\\/\\.\\.\\/\\.\\.\\/source\\//g' {} + which took about 20s to run reply mdaniel 2 hours agorootparentOne can express your sed in less Leaning Toothpick Syndrome[1] via: find . -type f -name \"*.html\" -exec sed -i '' -e 's|\\.\\./\\.\\./\\.\\./|../../../source/|g' {} + Using \"/\" as the delineation character for \"s\" patterns that include \"/\" drives me batshit - almost as much as scripts that use the doublequote for strings that contain no variables but also contain doublequotes (looking at you, json literals in awscli examples) If your sed is GNU, or otherwise sane, one can also `sed -Ee` and then use `s|\\Q../../../|` getting rid of almost every escape character. I got you half way there because one need not escape the \".\" in the replacement pattern because \".\" isn't a meta character in the replacement space - what would that even mean? 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_toothpick_syndrome reply skydhash 6 hours agorootparentprevParallel is nice when doing music conversion with ffmpeg. reply godelski 12 hours agorootparentprevPrimeagen detected I find him hard to listen to when he does things like this reply WizardClickBoy 11 hours agorootparentPrimeagen is some kind of Youtuber?

It is intrinsically mysterious. reply aidos 12 hours agoprev [–] sed, awk, grep and friends are just so effective at trawling through text. I dump about 150GB of Postgres logs a day (I know, it's over the top but I only keep a few days worth and there have been several occasions where I was saved by being able to pick through them). At that size you even need to give up on grepping, really. I've written a tiny bash script that uses the fact that log lines start with a timestamp and `dd` for immediate extraction. This allows me to quickly binary search for the location I'm interested in. Then I can `dd` to dump the region of the file I want. After that I have an little awk script that lets me collapse the sql lines (since they break across multiple lines) to make grepping really easy. All in all it's a handful of old school script that makes an almost impossible task easy. reply porridgeraisin 6 hours agoparent [–] Can you explain how you used dd here?

This would let you perform a binary search by picking an offset in the file, reading a small chunk (say, a kilobyte), and scanning for the date/time string within it. Each read should be O(1) in terms of the size of the file, so a O(log(n)) for the binary search, whereas a grep-based approach is O(n). (The datetime in the log message is presumably sorted, or nearly so). reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Hey HN!This is Tim from AnythingLLM (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Mintplex-Labs&#x2F;anything-llm). AnythingLLM is an open-source desktop assistant that brings together RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), agents, embeddings, vector databases, and more—all in one seamless package.We built AnythingLLM over the last year iterating and iterating from user feedback. Our primary mission is to enable people with a layperson understanding of AI to be able to use AI with little to no setup for either themselves, their jobs, or just to try out using AI as an assistant but with *privacy by default*.From these iterations & feedback, we have a couple of key learnings I wanted to share:- \"Chat with your docs\" solutions are a dime-a-dozen- Agent frameworks require knowing how to code or are too isolated from other tools- Users do not care about benchmarks, only outputs. The magic box needs to be magic to them.- Asking Consumers to start a docker container or open a terminal is a non-starter for most.- Privacy by default is non-negotiable. Either by personal preference or legal constraints- Everything needs to be in one placeFrom these ideas, we landed on the current state of AnythingLLM:- Everything in AnythingLLM is private by default, but fully customizable for advanced users.- Built-in LLM provider, but can swap at any time to the hundreds of other local or cloud LLM providers & models.- Built-in Vector Database, most users don&#x27;t even know that it is there.- Built-in Embedding model, but of course can change if the user wants to.- Scrape websites, import Github&#x2F;GitLab repos, YouTube Transcripts, Confluence spaces - all of this is already built in for the user.- An entire baked-in agent framework that works seamlessly within the app. We even pre-built a handful of agent skills for customers. Custom plugins are in the next update and will be able to be built with code, or a no-code builder.- All of this just works out of the box in a single installable app that can run on any consumer-grade laptop. Everything a user does, chats, or configures is stored on the user&#x27;s device. Available for Mac, Windows, and LinuxWe have been actively maintaining and working on AnythingLLM via our open-source repo for a while now and welcome contributors as we hopefully launch a Community Hub soon to really proliferate users&#x27; abilities to add more niche agent skills, data connectors, and more.*But there is even more*We view the desktop app as a hyper-accessible single-player version of AnythingLLM. We publish a Docker image too (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.docker.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;mintplexlabs&#x2F;anythingllm) that supports multi-user management with permissioning so that you can easily bring AnythingLLM into an organization with all of the same features with minimal headache or lift.The Docker image is for those more adept with a CLI, but being able to comfortably go from a single-user to a multi-user version of the same familiar app was very important for us.AnythingLLM aims to be more than a UI for LLMs, we are building a comprehensive tool to leverage LLMs and all that they can do while maintaining user privacy and not needing to be an expert on AI to do it.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anythingllm.com&#x2F;",

Obviously, if your computer is low-end or you really have been loving GPT-4o or Claude you _can_ use just that external component while still using a local vector db, document storage, etc. So its basically like opt-in for external usage of any particular part of the app, whether that be an LLM, embedder model, vector db, or otherwise. reply Tostino 1 hour agoparentprevIt doesn't seem like they are \"providing\" cloud models. They have their backend able to interface with whatever endpoint you want, given you have access.

Please read it on the website. Cover image origami credit: Rishi Iyer To freshen things up a bit, I decided to look up latest research from the 2024 International Microwave Symposium, the premier conference in the field of RF and Microwave engineering. What I found was an idea so interesting that I felt compelled to write about it. As it turns out, there is a new class of RF circuits that draw inspiration from Origami, the Japanese1 art of paper folding. Just like you can make different shapes out of paper, you can physically reconfigure circuits to operate differently. Hani Al Jamal, a PhD student, and a team of researchers led by Prof. Manos Tentzeris at Georgia Tech, authored a paper titled Beyond Planar: An Additively Manufactured, Origami-Inspired Shape-Changing, and RFIC-Based Phased Array for Near-Limitless Radiation Pattern Reconfigurability in 5G/mm-Wave Applications, which won the Best Paper Award at the 2024 International Microwave Symposium. This paper describes a phased array antenna from which you can synthesize any radiation pattern. It uses both electronic and physical modifications to achieve this. Special thanks to Hani for providing additional information, pictures and for reviewing a draft of this post. In this post, we will get into the details of exactly how this works. Need for Adaptive RF Circuits Eggbox Phased Array Interconnect Systems Practical Applications Read time: 9 mins Need for Adaptive RF Circuits Fixed RF systems are not optimum for changing RF environments. It is preferable if RF blocks are context aware and adjust to give optimal overall system performance. Previously, reconfigurability meant that components such as antennas were mounted on large servos and moved about to point to the source of the signal. In fact, radio astronomers continue to build big parabolic dishes on train tracks and move them about to make various configurations in order to receive faint signals from space. This is often too slow for modern applications. Engineers soon realized that they could achieve the same outcomes by steering antennas with phased arrays. Instead of shifting the antennas, they could achieve the same result by adjusting the phase shift between separate antennas. The constructive and destructive interference between the array's antennas helped to steer the radiated beam without physically moving it. Because everything is electronic, steering antennas takes only a few microseconds. If you need an introduction to antenna and phased arrays, check out my earlier posts. A Preliminary Guide to Antenna Arrays Vikram Sekar · Jan 28 Read full story How does a Phased Array Antenna work? Types of Beamforming Architectures Vikram Sekar · Feb 11 Read full story What if we could combine physical alteration and electronic beam steering? This is an excellent use for foldable phased arrays, as it allows for slow, origami-like physical transformations, followed by quick directional changes via electronic beam steering. Can we create any antenna pattern we desire and then direct the beam? Eggbox Phased Array The phased array antenna in the Georgia Tech research paper was inspired by the design of an eggbox made of paper. It's just a grid of upside-down square-base pyramids with an open base for eggs. The research study describes how one of these open-base pyramids might be utilized as a foundation for bigger reconfigurable arrays. When looking at just one of them, the unit cell resembles an origami fortune teller, which my children frequently build. Construction of the unit cell used in the eggbox/fortune-teller phased array. Source: Hani Al Jamal, Georgia Tech. A 4-element phased array antenna is installed on all four faces of this eggbox-unit/fortune-teller, and the beam is steered in 11.25° increments by a Qorvo AWMF-0108 28 GHz beamformer RFIC. This unit cell, like an origami design, may be folded across either axis or laid flat, allowing you to physically change the direction of radiation. Because the phased array antenna on each face can steer the beam further, the antenna can be utilized to generate almost any radiation pattern using a combination of physical folding and electronic beam steering. Here are some ways to shape the radiated beam from this antenna. 360° azimuth coverage: In its pyramidal arrangement, activate only one phased array and direct the beam to its maximum value before switching to the phased array on the next face. This ensures a continuous handoff between multiple phased arrays on the faces while also providing 360° azimuth beam steering. Bending along an axis: Fold the array along any one axis, and as the fold angle reduces the radiation pattern changes from a four-beam to a two-beam configuration, as illustrated in the image. Arbitrary shaped beams: Fold the array by an arbitrary angle across either axis, turn on anywhere from a single phased array to all four phased arrays, apply digital weights to the phased array to control both amplitude and phase to antenna elements (even gain tapering to control grating lobes), and you can virtually synthesize any radiation pattern you are looking for.

Subscribe Interconnect Systems When you see a foldable circuit running at 28 GHz, the first thing you think about is the foldable interconnect's RF performance and stability over repeated folding. Any fairly skilled RF engineer who has worked in a laboratory understands that RF cables should not be bent. Yet, this is exactly what is required in an origami-based design. To solve this problem, the authors devised a novel method that employs an arch hinge interconnect that is manufactured utilizing 3D printing technology with flexible80A, a flexible photopolymer resin. The connector is a 50Ω transmission line inkjet printed onto a Rogers RO3003 substrate, paired with 3D printed support structures. The result is a stable hinge design that does maintains low loss over the 180° range of folding, and shows no degradation up to 300 folds. Foldable arch hinge interconnect. Source: IEEE [1] Another difficulty when constructing interconnects for the eggbox unit cell is that the feed-point can only be located on one of the 3D structure's faces. This means that the interconnect system does not feed the structure's four phased arrays symmetrically2. To compensate for the discrepancy in overall electrical length, extra transmission line sections have been included in the form of a βl adjustment in the figure below. Detailed design of the egg box unit cell. Source: IEEE [1] Practical Applications The eggbox unit cell can be cascaded to build a bigger array that can be spatially altered along either axis, which is what makes this design so appealing. The modular design method offers other advantages: If a single unit cell fails, it can readily replaced. Selective faces of the eggbox array can be activated to generate various radiation patterns based on power usage and transmit/receive operating modes. The additive 3D printing process generates less waste. Constructing a larger array out of eggbox unit cells. Source: Hani Al Jamal, Georgia Tech. Let's look at some ways this phased array can be effectively used: Full Duplex Operation: If we would like to use the same antenna array to transmit and receive simultaneously, the modular design allows one to activate all phased arrays on one face for transmitting and use another face for receiving. The capacity to electronically control beams enables them to track targets if necessary. Multi-beam Operation: By using different folding angles, we already saw how we could synthesize two or four beams from the array. In autonomous cars, for example, each beam can be assigned a particular purpose, such as communication, navigation, or obstacle avoidance. Adjustable Beam Widths: Because the folding angle determines the width of the beam, unfolding the array to produce vast beam widths aids in aircraft search operations, while folding up the array results in a small beam that aids in focused rescue missions. Space Constrained Systems: The ability to fold up an antenna array during launch and then deploy while in orbit is particularly useful given the growing popularity of compact form-factor, low-cost spacecraft such as CubeSats. Reshaping the antenna array and directing beams in space will help to construct satellite mesh networks, increasing connectivity around the world. This implementation of an origami-inspired antenna has only two degrees of freedom, but it establishes the way for future developments that will include even more degrees of freedom for reconfigurability. The capacity to freely adjust radiation beams will be critical to the future of wireless communications, whether for 5G, 6G, automotive radar, space, or military applications.

It's clickbait. ;) reply vikramskr 20 minutes agoparentNewsletter author here- i literally made my 9 year old make an origami fortune teller for the title cover image. Tried to deliver on the promise! :) reply jpm_sd 10 hours agoprevThis is extremely academic. Reinventing flex circuits on a 3D printer?? AFAICT they built exactly one \"unit cell\" and there's no way that SPI interconnect scales to an array reply ranger_danger 16 hours agoprev [–] Cool stuff, this kind of phased array antenna is also how modern radars work without moving parts. reply pbmonster 10 hours agoparent [–] Did you read the article? This type of phased array has a rather large number of moving parts, including a number of folding GHz transmission lines. Personally, I'm very skeptic whether we'll ever see this design outside of bespoke high performance applications. The fact that this is very cool doesn't change the huge advantage classic planar phased arrays have by literally having zero moving parts. reply vikramskr 18 minutes agorootparentNewsletter author here- Agree moving parts suck. But they are interesting in fold up, deploy and unfurl in mini satellite applications perhaps reply mynameisvlad 9 hours agorootparentprev [–] Which part of the array is movable, exactly? The article did not describe a movable array. There are folds, sure, but they seem entirely static. And the only time it was even mentioned is when deploying it via satellites (unfolding the array into a particular configuration). reply b3orn 8 hours agorootparent [–] To quote the section \"Eggbox Phased Array\": > This unit cell, like an origami design, may be folded across either axis or laid flat, allowing you to physically change the direction of radiation. Because the phased array antenna on each face can steer the beam further, the antenna can be utilized to generate almost any radiation pattern using a combination of physical folding and electronic beam steering. To me \"physically change the direction of radiation\" is rather explicit that the antenna isn't static. reply regularfry 4 hours agorootparent [–] Also: > When you see a foldable circuit running at 28 GHz, the first thing you think about is the foldable interconnect's RF performance and stability over repeated folding...The result is a stable hinge design that does maintains low loss over the 180° range of folding, and shows no degradation up to 300 folds. This is very clearly intended to be physically reconfigurable. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

I know I was boots on the ground reply jftuga 18 hours agoprevHere are the six. This is an article excerpt: Moody’s Investor Services and S&P Global Ratings agreed to pay the heftiest fines, a $20 million civil penalty each. Fitch Ratings agreed to pay $8 million, A.M. Best Rating Services agreed to pay $1 million, HR Ratings de México, S.A. de C.V. $250,000, and Demotech agreed to pay $100,000, respectively. reply r00fus 18 hours agoparentReally a pittance compared to how much these organizations turn over on a quarterly basis... but it's a good start. reply AstroJetson 17 hours agorootparent... hourly basis in the case of Moodys. reply ryandrake 17 hours agorootparentIt's 0.3% of their 2023 revenue. It's proportional to a $360 fine to a person who makes $120K. Not even remotely deterring. I'd be surprised if they even noticed it was gone. reply stvltvs 17 hours agorootparentIt's a speeding ticket, might be enough to make the company think twice. reply lupusreal 18 hours agoprev [–] Companies should be fined for keeping electronic records of personal data instead of paper. Enough is enough, keeping sensitive data on computers is a failed experiment and the sooner we collectively admit that, the better. reply JumpCrisscross 18 hours agoparent> keeping sensitive data on computers is a failed experiment and the sooner we collectively admit that, the better In this experiment, what were the measured outcomes? They obviously don’t include lookup or storage costs; transparency; auditability or scalability. reply passwordoops 18 hours agorootparentI'll give you storage costs and scalability. But digital does not equate to transparency. A culture of transparency equates to transparency. Also, paper is very auditable. The term \"paper trail\" is not an accident and in many circumstances can be more secure and reliable than digital reply JumpCrisscross 18 hours agorootparent> digital does not equate to transparency. A culture of transparency equates to transparency Doesn’t equate to, yes. Enables far more by default, absolutely. The substantial plot of Erin Brockovich is essentially resolved, today, in a few minutes of searching. reply toast0 17 hours agorootparentprevI mean, there's a lot of transparency with digital records. Sometimes too much transparency. reply r00fus 18 hours agoparentprevI think you can just omit the \"instead of on paper\". The more companies that don't store personal data, the better. What's their rationale? reply jfengel 18 hours agoparentprevThese weren't personal data. They were business records. They didn't specify but it might be things like who was accessing what and when. reply hiatus 17 hours agorootparentThey gave at least one example of the type of records they failed to maintain: > For example, Moody’s Ratings Employees – including at the senior level – were communicating about credit ratings activities via text messages and WhatsApp on their personal devices, according to an SEC order. That included an associate managing director making off-channel comments about credit rating clients. reply Cruncharoo 17 hours agorootparentThis is part of the larger SEC crackdown on personal device communications. They've already collected billions from banks and other firms: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/08/business/banks-fines-what... reply hiatus 17 hours agoparentprev [–] What does this have to do with the OP? reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
