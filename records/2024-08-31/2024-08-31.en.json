    "originBody": "Is my vision that bad? No, it’s just a bug in Apple’s Calculator. 14 Replies While programming on my Mac and converting decimal numbers to hex and binary and using Apple’s Calculator for it – because it is built-in and works decent – I thought, I saw some wobbly lines of numbers. My first thought was: my eyes are getting tired. But it looked annoyingly wobbly and there went my focus on the task. I had to investigate, what was going on. I took a screenshot. Can you see it in the image above? Let me highlight the annoying detail in the image below. Maybe you are reading this on a tiny screen, or your eyes are tired, but also… I had to see it for myself. Here is a zoomed in version below: Yes, indeed! Some digits in the binary display section are off by one pixel. Nice anti-aliased rendering by the way, but still, why are some digits misplaced by a pixel? How did this happen? I should add, the calculator app has been open for many days. Maybe the UI coordinate system is using floats and a rounding error aggregated over many days… I’d love to find out, but I guess I won’t. Anyways, at least my vision is not that bad. I would contact Apple, if there was a feedback option, but there isn’t, so I won’t. Instead I’ll just share the bug on the Internet. Enjoy!

    "commentBody": "Is my vision that bad? No, it's just a bug in Apple's Calculator (wojtczyk.de)512 points by wojtczyk 14 hours agohidepastfavorite291 comments jb1991 9 hours agoOn mobile devices, Apple’s Calculator app has always been one of the most frustrating apps I’ve ever used, and I’m surprised it’s a stock app by the company itself. If you press buttons quickly, like you would a normal calculator, many of the key presses simply don’t register at all. I’m not sure if they’re prioritizing some pretty little visual animation over actual functionality, but it’s incredibly surprising from a company that focuses on user interaction, supposedly. reply PaulHoule 5 hours agoparentApple's greatest weakness is that many of it's fans and I'd assume people in house assume they are the epitome of UI design when actually it's not. The thoughtlessness/pixel ratio might be worse than Microsoft in some cases, which can be hard to believe. reply diggan 5 hours agorootparent> Apple's greatest weakness is that many of it's fans and I'd assume people in house assume they are the epitome of UI design when actually it's not. Which led to people like me making a fool out of themselves. Always been using Android, and listened to iPhone users singing the praise of the amazing UI and UX of iOS. Well, eventually iPhone 12 Mini released so I figured, \"why not give it a try, can't be worse than my current Motorola Moto G gen4 right?\" Well, it is worse. I still have the phone because it still works, but that was my first and last iPhone. Everything is dog slow, not because poor performance but because of slow animations. Same on Android by default, but at least I can speed it up. And the UX makes you jump through hoops, things are impossible to discover unless you watch tutorials on YouTube, and the amount of UI bugs seems sky-high for something that sells itself as \"Premium\". And then CarPlay is just an abomination! Even the most basic things like \"I'd like to answer a call while still being able to see the map I use for navigation\" seems to be completely ignored and it honestly doesn't make any sense at all. Ugh, I almost look forward to accidentally dropping the phone so I can go back to having a non-distracting experience in the car again. Edit: I just remembered the most egregious issue: How can I see the current year without having to open up a separate calendar application/put a huge widget on my home screen? reply crtasm 3 hours agorootparent>slow animations. Same on Android by default, but at least I can speed it up. Enabling the power user/developer menu in Android's settings lets me disable animations entirely.

Did you read that? I posit that if one needs to load up the Tips app to figure out how to perform desired functions, that's a problem with the UX and not the human trying to use the device/app. The ideas espoused in The Design of Everyday Things[0] pops into mind right now. [0] https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expand... reply bagful 21 minutes agorootparentOn the contrary I think it’s quite reasonable to gate functionality behind reading the manual. But one wonders why it’s a distinct application and not integrated throughout the system, such as through tooltips or a “question mark cursor”? reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentprev> Did you try Accessibility > Motion > Off? There is no \"Motion > Off\" but there is a \"Reduce Motion\" toggle. Seems to be turning things that were slowly animated into even slower fade, like when you switch applications. Doesn't seem to actually affect much, animations inside for example Apple applications is still there, no matter if that toggle is on or off. > There's a pretty useful manual built into the device itself called Hints I think? Did you read that? I've browsed through it, but I don't think it's in no way extensive? I tried to find anything documenting the \"Hold on spacebar and drag to move text cursor\" in the Tips application (that I'm guessing you're referring to?) and found nothing, which is one of the features I \"discovered\" purely by accident. reply mh- 1 hour agorootparentThere's a manual for iOS. Here's[0] the section about the onscreen keyboard (ctrl-f for trackpad to find the spacebar thing). Expand the Table of Contents + at the top to see all the sections.

A trackpad is for controlling a pointer, like a mouse, not to control the \"insertion point of text\". Great that it is mentioned somewhere, in some manner, I guess. reply amluto 55 minutes agorootparentprevWow, for just a second I was excited. And then I looked in Accessibility > Motion and there’s no “off”. I tried “Reduce Motion” and deleted an old Wallet Pass, and it still did a ridiculous and obscenely slow animation. reply runjake 2 hours agorootparentprevI think you’re talking about iOS. If so, it’s Settings -> Accessibility -> Reduce Motion -> On reply vaindil 55 minutes agorootparentprev> Edit: I just remembered the most egregious issue: How can I see the current year without having to open up a separate calendar application/put a huge widget on my home screen? I'm not a fan of Apple for many reasons and I agree with your overall sentiment (though not with the same voracity), but I'm really curious how _this_ is the most egregious issue for you. The calendar year changes so infrequently, why would you need it featured so prominently? reply diggan 49 minutes agorootparent> but I'm really curious how _this_ is the most egregious issue for you. Because it's so basic. Add a switch that lets me decide how I want the date to be displayed on the lockscreen/notifications centre. > why would you need it featured so prominently? It doesn't need to be more prominently than where the date is right now, I just want the current year next to it as well. reply Hnrobert42 3 hours agorootparentprevI am curious where you perceive the slowness. I always had flagship Androids before my switch to a 12 mini. Overall I am happy. There are plenty of things that annoy me lots but I never really noticed slowness. Where do you notice it? Do you play games or use compute intensive apps? reply diggan 3 hours agorootparent> I always had flagship Androids before my switch to a 12 mini. And I had budget Android phones (Motorola Moto G) before my 12 mini, yet the iPhone is worse on most points besides the display and sound. > Where do you notice it? Do you play games or use compute intensive apps? Anywhere where there is an animation/sliding/transition. Everything feels like it's moving in molasses. But it's very much not a Apple-specific issue, designers nowadays seems to make animations in general way too slow. Which is fine when it can be configured (like on Android) but Apple doesn't like customization (or used to at least), so we can't. reply bombela 1 hour agorootparentEverything is molasses and it irritates me to the point where I am hurting myself out of stress and anger by the simple fact that I have to constantly abort my muscle movements and train of throught to let the stupid software finish rhe animation/lag/burning my computer. It turns out most people are not bothered by this. Somehow they are still slower than those animations. On of my biggest suffering in life. reply runjake 3 hours agorootparentprevThis sounds backwards, based on my experiences. I keep thinking of switching back to Android, so I keep a recent-ish Pixel in my inventory. I do not observe this on my 12 Mini that is on iOS 16. Comparing it to my Pixel 6a with stock Android 14, I’d say the iPhone is faster/smoother and less glitchy moving around the UI. Perhaps something is up with your 12? That would still be a ding on Apple. reply chowells 2 hours agorootparentI think you misunderstand the complaint. What you perceive as \"smooth\", they perceive as \"obnoxiously slow\". They don't want smooth, they want the animation to be over so they can get on with life without waiting for it. reply diggan 1 hour agorootparentprevAs the other commentator is saying, it's about the speed of the animation. It's the same on every iPhone, including mine, but it's too slow for someone who doesn't want to be \"amazed by cool animations/translations\" every time I switch pane/panel/window/go back/go forward. > 12 Mini that is on iOS 16. Comparing it to my Pixel 6a with stock Android 14 Enable the Developer/Debug menu on your Android phone, turn off animations inside that menu then compare the \"snappiness\" between the two. While the iPhone puts animations/transitions/fades between everything, the Android will immediately \"jump\" to what you wanted, without animations. If you try this out, I'm sure you'll notice what I mean. This is what I want on my phone too, or at least 100x faster animations. reply EricE 1 hour agorootparentHave you reduced motion in the accessibility settings? Sounds very similar to the devloper settings in Android. reply diggan 1 hour agorootparentYes, to no avail. Mentioned earlier here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41409580 reply eks391 3 hours agorootparentprevI've used a few apple products -- the iPhone 3 was my first smartphone, and an iPad mini back when tablets were starting out. At the time of the switch to android, I didn't think too much of it, but definitely enjoyed the customisation. A couple years ago I was gonna get a new phone and, half my family being Apple devotees, I was considering switching again so I could stop hearing the 'blue bubble' nagging, plus they seem to genuinely enjoy their phone. In pure luck, a friend had a new iPhone 13 and hadn't switched from his old phone yet, and allowed me to use it for a couple days so I could see just how incredible the phones are and I should switch. After about 48 hrs, I was so done with the product, and like you, preferred to switch back to my old 'crummy' phone until I bought my next flagship. I can't imagine being locked in till it dies, because as you said, the iPhone is such a miserable product. I'm sure you could resell and get a flagship for a similar price. You'd still net loss, but IMO it would be better than keeping the phone since you don't like it. reply fishtacos 1 hour agorootparentAlong these same lines, the tabletification of Mac OS is annoying. A friend asked me to help with importing photos from the Apple Photo app on his brand new desktop Mac. The sequence of events was: Lightroom Legacy needs photos imported because the new Lightroom (cloud/subscription version I believe) has a different workflow, interface and apparently, features, so he's using both for the time being. So he follows guides on Adobe to import from iPhoto through a plugin. I had to learn after much google-fu that iPhoto has been replaced by the new Photo app. No compatible libraries found, says the unhelpful error message. No way to import his Photos library into it without first exporting all photos into a separate folder and importing that one into Lightroom Legacy. Why there is no compatibility shim/layer for that functionality I will never understand... He refuses to export and reimport all his photos because he has A LOT of them. He does photography as a hobby primarily, but has been using his iPad and iPhone for a while without a Mac PC and was astonished at not being able to do such a simple process. Part of my troubleshooting involved looking for a potential directory where the Photos app stored the files. It's some sort of package file that creates what seems to be the equivalent of a virtual directory. So I search for the Mac Drive icon... that took me to google, to then Finder, settings, and enable showing the drive. Why the hell does Apple hide the frigging storage device?!!! (I know why... but it's maddening) One more reason to never want to use or support any Apple product in the future. reply diggan 1 hour agorootparentprev> I can't imagine being locked in till it dies, because as you said, the iPhone is such a miserable product. I'm sure you could resell and get a flagship for a similar price. You'd still net loss, but IMO it would be better than keeping the phone since you don't like it. I'm not locked to it but honestly I spend so little time on my phone that it's one of the smaller problems in my life. I do despise it, but not enough to sell it before I can't use it anymore. reply talldayo 1 hour agorootparentprevThe older I get, the more certain I am that Apple products are designed from the ground-up as ad-watching appliances. On iPad, you're restricted to a sandboxed environment where you are not encouraged (or in many cases, allowed) to do anything other than watch ads. You cannot sideload apps that are Open Source. You cannot install emulators or fullspeed VM software. You cannot switch the browser out for one you would prefer with controls amenable to your satisfaction. You watch ads, because any holistic path to entertaining yourself is either sold by Apple or monetized through advertisements. On every Apple platform. I remember watching those \"what's a computer?\" ads and laughing out loud. Yeah, what is a computer? We've gone so long watching YouTube ads and Music.ly sponsored content that half of us don't even know what one is. Are we even still connected, when companies like Apple mediate how we're allowed to communicate with each other and share ideas? Apple's design for a bicycle for the mind has been repurposed into a flywheel for cash generation. I don't meet a single person \"riding\" their iPhone anywhere more important than Pornhub or Instagram. reply diggan 1 hour agorootparent> You cannot sideload apps that are Open Source. You cannot install emulators or fullspeed VM software. You cannot switch the browser out for one you would prefer with controls amenable to your satisfaction. Worth noting that while this used to be true, those things are now/soon geofenced features that only Europeans get to enjoy. Too bad if you happen to live in the home country of Apple. reply talldayo 1 hour agorootparentI don't believe you're allowed to run fullspeed VM software or JIT-enabled browsers, even with the DMA. Nothing has been super set-in-stone yet, but those are the terms Apple is intent on promoting. reply cyberax 37 minutes agorootparent> I don't believe you're allowed to run fullspeed VM software or JIT-enabled browsers, even with the DMA. You can. There's a new JIT entitlement for web browsers in Europe. It's still limited to _only_ browsers, so emulators are out of luck. reply diggan 1 hour agorootparentprevThe intention is for people to be able to run whatever software they want, and Apple is currently figuring out if EU wants Apple to follow the intent of the law, or the letter. We'll see how it goes but I wouldn't hold my breath for Apple to get their will. reply PaulHoule 4 hours agorootparentprevCarPlay is a thing because carmakers just can't seem to make a decent \"radio\" with a touchscreen no matter how they try. It would be nice to see a business school case study that reveals why. reply DistractionRect 3 hours agorootparentRadios don't need a touch screen. Old button radios are pretty intuitive. The display/touch aspect is because people want navigation, apps like deezer/itunes/Spotify, etc. Then you have to think about updates/real time data. How does that work? Does the car need its own data plan? Or do we do everything via usb and just do everything offline? And then people still expect to connect their phones to the car, for calls/reading texts etc, so you still have to support that in some way... and people will expect that to play nice with the audio playback features (calls pause/unpause music, etc) Since we're already supporting a phone connection, then it just makes life easier to bring your own experience. The auto maker supplies the interface, you bring your own apps, data plan, etc via carplay/android auto. Personally, I find it's a huge step forward to whatever OEMs make in house which aren't updated/obsolete in a few years. reply akdev1l 32 minutes agorootparentIn theory you could use a smartphone as data provider for updates etc reply copperx 3 hours agorootparentprevThat problem isn't limited to \"radios.\" Have you ever used a smart thermostat? A touchscreen fridge? A smart TV? Horrible, horrible UX. reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentprev> CarPlay is a thing because carmakers just can't seem to make a decent \"radio\" with a touchscreen no matter how they try But CarPlay is 100x worse than Android Auto, even though Apple is supposed to excel at UI and UX, this was the point I was trying to make, not that car makers such at UI/UX. reply Angostura 2 hours agorootparentHaving used both, I disagree. What do you prefer with AA? reply diggan 2 hours agorootparentWell, for starters, if I'm using a map app on the CarPlay/Android Auto dashboard, then I expect phone calls to not cover the entire screen automatically, as I'm probably using the map for navigation. Anything on top of that would just be extras, but something basic like that should work at least. Which it does on Android Auto, but not on CarPlay. reply lotsofpulp 2 hours agorootparentprevI am happy CarPlay and Android Auto are a thing because I do not want to give any other entity access to my phone. reply marcosdumay 4 hours agorootparentprev> things are impossible to discover unless you watch tutorials on YouTube My last Android phone made me watch about a dozen youtube videos to discover how to configure it... It's not an Apple thing anymore. reply saagarjha 1 hour agorootparentprevYou can answer the call and switch back to Maps while the call continues, right? reply diggan 59 minutes agorootparent> You can answer the call and switch back to Maps while the call continues, right? Yes, I can, and currently have to, but absolutely 0 times I've answered a call in the car and want the Phone app to cover the entire screen, no matter what I had there before. It's just extra dangerous when I'm using maps, as maybe I have a turn I have to make in that exact moment, and having to go back to the maps just because some designer at Apple want to showcase their contact/name/phone number layout in the Phone app sounds like asking for trouble. reply codelikeawolf 3 hours agorootparentprev> And then CarPlay is just an abomination! Even the most basic things like \"I'd like to answer a call while still being able to see the map I use for navigation\" seems to be completely ignored and it honestly doesn't make any sense at all. I totally agree that this is terrible. But this kind of behavior always makes me wonder if this is a \"passive aggressive safety\" thing. I have a 2019 Subaru Impreza, and I can't change the time on the clock unless I'm in park. I tried it at a red light once because I got sick of seeing the wrong time after DST and I thought something was messed up, but it turns out it was because I was in drive. I'm fully capable of changing the time at a red light without causing an 8 car pile-up, just like you're fully capable of talking on the phone and following directions while driving. Regardless of whether it's a bad UX thing or a misguided attempt at safety thing, it's still super annoying. reply diggan 3 hours agorootparent> I totally agree that this is terrible. But this kind of behavior always makes me wonder if this is a \"passive aggressive safety\" thing. I'm 99% sure no one of the designers who created those UX flows have ever actually used CarPlay in real life, like the users do. It's really hard for me to imagine a designer coming up with an appropriate reason for blocking the map view because you answered a call. reply bombela 46 minutes agorootparentI don't know why you are being down voted. I know from first sources that it is true. The car dash design is completed independently of the UX/UI work. And the designers/programmers never test it in the car. There is almost no iteration there. In fact the people I talked to worked remotes. They couldn't even try to get into a prototype car if they wanted. reply ein0p 1 hour agorootparentprevYou could disable animations on iOS through accessibility options.

Makes it even worse in the cases I tested actually. > As a rule a flagship iPhone is at least 30% faster than flagship Android (by which I basically mean Samsung Galaxy) on realistic workloads. That's cool, but not what I'm talking about. Even my Motorola Moto G4 (released in 2016) allowed me to turn off the animations, so even that one \"appears\" faster than my iPhone 12 Mini only because iOS forces you to wait for animations to finish. reply Dylan16807 20 minutes agorootparentprevA phone doesn't spend much time doing \"workloads\". UI animations in particular should never be close to CPU or GPU bound. reply jb1991 4 hours agorootparentprevThat might have been true once, but I don't think that's really true any more. Most users are not awed by their iPhone experience as they were ten years ago. Everyone realizes that iOS and Android are essentially identical for most practical purposes and usability, and most are not choosing the platform for that reason any more. I also think plenty of people in-house at Apple are well-aware of these issues. Today, it is more about maintaining your suite of apps, the Cloud with all your data, the little blue bubbles in your group chats, and a host of other issues that are more a priority for choosing one platform over another, for most people. If I were to switch to Android now, it would be a huge PIA considering the 10+ years of platform integration and thousands of dollars of app purchases, iCloud, etc, that has made up a significant part of my digital life. I'm sure it would be similar for people going in reverse. Apple knows this, hence why services have become an essential part of their business. reply jwells89 3 hours agorootparentThe thing that keeps me on iOS is that Android just doesn’t feel right, and none of the tweaks that can be applied (launchers, etc) can fix that. Animations, interactions, etc just feel… off somehow, like I’m using an early alpha build of software that has placeholders strewn about. It’s not a “it’s not iOS” thing, either. There are certain desktop Linux setups for example that don’t bother me nearly as much. It’s just Android that feels “wrong”. If only the entire front end of Android were interchangeable like Linux DEs are. reply diggan 54 minutes agorootparent> Animations, interactions, etc just feel… off somehow, like I’m using an early alpha build of software that has placeholders strewn about. It's funny that I'm the complete opposite. I was fine with Android, switched to iPhone (as mentioned upthread) and everything feels off, like no one cared about the UI and UX, and bugs galore everywhere. If someone handed me my iPhone 12 Mini today I'd say they're running a beta version of iOS on it. Maybe it's just a \"get used to\" thing as we're surely not the only ones having very opposite feelings about this. I've now had my iPhone for 4 years it seems, but I still feel like the OS is beta-level quality, should have gotten used to it by now... reply dylan604 3 hours agorootparentprevI'm in the same mind. As much improvement as Linux GUIs have made over the years, there's always just been that last bit of polish they are missing that makes them feel just a bit klunky in comparison to an Apple OS. Does it affect performance, no, but it just has that OSS feel to it. I totally understand the $$$ differences involved, and modern *nix UIs have come a long way, but it's like that last mile problem they just can't quite get there. It does not make it unusable, it's just the thing that always makes it noticeably different. reply airstrike 3 hours agorootparentprevI think it's just the lack of consistency in app designs reply brookst 4 hours agorootparentprevIt’s really the cross-device stuff that keeps me in Apple’s ecosystem. Taking phone calls on my mac, having recent browser tabs from all devices on every device, etc. of course each individual thing can be done on windows / android / linux, but the out-of-the-box, no-config-required experience is really very good. Even if it is frequently and frustratingly not perfect. reply jmholla 14 minutes agorootparentAndroid has a lot of those features through KDE Connect now. reply troupo 2 hours agorootparentprevApple used to be the epitome (or close to it) of UI design. There was care and attention to detail that usually went into their designs. The past 10 years or so? Everything has gone out of the window. No one is left at Apple who cares. reply kurthr 4 minutes agoparentprevMaybe it will be fixed in Apple Calculator for iPad (soon to be released 2024) in iOS 18?!? reply lynndotpy 27 minutes agoparentprevI'm happy this isn't just me. Apple's calculator app is a showcase for some of their most obtuse UX decisions. IO-blocking animations are everywhere on iOS, and sometimes they result in overlap (e.g. you can activate a widget and open an app if you press an app icon too fast after opening a folder). But having buttons on iOS animate in response to touch but not engage any further is mindblowing and infuriating. It's also filled with obtuse interactions. (Did you know the iPhone's calculator app has extra buttons? You have to use the control center, unlock your screen rotation, and then rotate your phone to access it.) (Did you know you can erase digits by swiping left or right on them? You can't _access_ the hidden digits of precision this way.) reply bqmjjx0kac 3 hours agoparentprevI switched to an iPhone a few years ago and I really miss the Android calculator app. It showed the entire expression typed so far and its current value! In desperation, I have resorted to SSHing to my desktop and using `python` as a calculator. reply EricE 1 hour agorootparentIf you rely on a calculator then you owe it to yourself to check out pcalc.

I have to slow down to input my passcode or button pushes don’t register. reply meroes 24 minutes agorootparentI swear I’ve put in the wrong passcode before hastily and it unlocks. I wonder if it’s because of this lag the display doesn’t match the input so I really did input it correctly but it just didn’t look like it. reply deergomoo 5 hours agorootparentprevThe lock screen has been buggy for me for years at this point. At least once a day I'll turn on the screen and for half a second or so the notifications will render with perfectly square edges and then switch to the correct rounded version. Also quite frequently I'll swipe up to view notifications beyond the fold and they'll end up in weird places, like they'll jump further up than they should or jerk around. reply tolmasky 5 hours agorootparentprevIt’s very easy to reproduce this bug, even if you don’t go quickly. Basically, if your tap becomes a “swipe” that leaves the button area, then a previously registered “tap” that’s already shown up in the field will actually “unregister” and disappear from the field. Try it yourself: tap down on a button, watch the dot appear, then without lifting your finger, swipe out of the button, and watch it disappear. This happens a lot when tapping quickly since you are tapping and beginning to move your finger in the direction of the next button. You have to train yourself to make only up and down motions to be able to go quickly. It is indeed very annoying. The way these buttons should work is like telephone buttons (registering on the “mousedown”, not “mouseup”), and not like OK buttons (that register on the “mouseup”), but instead they chose a weird combination of both. reply moritzwarhier 3 hours agorootparentThe \"keypress\" behavior is not a bug in my opinion, it's a well-established behavior across platforms. You could do the same thing with a button+mouse on a desktop. The dot for the typed character appearing immediately is different from alphanumeric keyboard behavior, because you can't register any key press before releasing the touch (or key) there, due to composition. In my opinion, this is sensible behavior and your vision sounds like it would be a nightmare in reality to me, accidentally pressing neighbouring keys or tapping instead of swiping all the time. Is this any different on Android? I've used Android for most of my smartphone life. And I can't remember how often I was relieved to be able to cancel an accidental tap by swiping away, when I accidentally tapped a link while scrolling for example. This is even the default for mouse buttons, no? It happens, while rarely, still regularly, that I notice I pressed the wrong button just after the mousedown, but before the mouseup. And since I can remember, I was happy that the UI was made so I could then just hold the mouse button and move out of that button to cancel. Just verified your description of the lock screen code buttons. Not a bug, but the behavior you describe would feel buggy to me. There are plenty of UX annoyances on iOS though, that is not what I want to deny. I also prefer GBoard over apples builtin onscreen keyboard. reply tolmasky 3 hours agorootparentThere’s always been two button modes. “mouseup” is indeed the most common. However, “mousedown” is used in certain cases where the feedback is immediate, for example in the phone app where the number shows up as soon as you tap. However, notice that the lock screen uses neither of these, but rather a strange combination of both: it registers on “mousedown”, just like the phone app, showing a new dot in the field, but then will “unregister” if you move away and lift your finger, removing the dot. As far as I can tell, this is the only place buttons work this way. reply moritzwarhier 3 hours agorootparentYes, but I feel this is totally Ok here? I think it would slow me down even more if it didn't have this behavior, because of typing in extra unintended numbers? I don't have any issues with typing my passcode in quickly, and tbh hadn't noticed the tweak with the immediate feedback on \"tapdown\" (and the possibility of the number disappearing). Would have to try, but I still feel I prefer the current behavior to what you suggested, and I'm pretty sure it's intentional. Anyway, thanks for bringing this up, hadn't noticed! I'll admit, for me this is good interaction design. reply tolmasky 2 hours agorootparentYour comment implied that this was following the traditional pattern where moving away cancels an action before it takes place. I hope we at minimum agree that the Lock Screen uses a unique behavior that doesn’t exist anywhere else in the UI. I really think you’re just confusing this third interaction mode we’re describing with the traditional mouseup mode that has existed for 3 decades everywhere else. The simplest comparison point is the calculator app which behaves exactly as you described: if you put your finger down on the number 9, a 9 won’t show up until you lift up your finger. OTOH, if it worked like the Lock Screen, a 9 would show up, but would then be removed if you moved your finger away and lifted up. But again, nowhere else works this way. If you think this is good interaction design, do you thus think the calculator app has bad interaction design? That it should instead be adding numbers immediately and then retroactively removing them? reply Dylan16807 16 minutes agorootparentprev> I think it would slow me down even more if it didn't have this behavior, because of typing in extra unintended numbers? Can you explain how extra numbers would happen if it simply triggered on press? Do you often mis-press a number, then drag your finger out to cancel? reply squeaky-clean 3 hours agorootparentprevThe bug is that it shows they character as entered into the passcode when it really isn't. The bubbles should only update when you get lift your finger, not when you initially press it down. > The dot for the typed character appearing immediately is different from alphanumeric keyboard behavior, because you can't register any key press before releasing the touch (or key) there, due to composition. That is exactly why the dot should not appear immediately upon the down event. reply teekert 5 hours agorootparentprevTry switching focus mode from the lockscreen (by long pressing somewhere inbetween all notifications, widgets, the clock etc).

Edit: zooming in closer it's maybe not outside the box at all, but there's some odd aliasing artifacts or something making the space above the highlight look bigger than the space below. Honestly I don't think it makes it any better if the Unicode text is theoretically centered; the fact that there's zero separation between the options, and such poor spacing that it's difficult to tell and feels awkward either way is still terrible design. reply samatman 7 hours agorootparentprev> Its actually the center of the button Upvoted for putting in the effort, and because you make a correct point. But the Unicode button is perceptually off center, because ASCII is a smaller word, and there's no visible boundary between the buttons. This comes up a lot in iconography, the classic example is a play triangle (like the media control) in a circle. Placing the triangle in the geometric center won't look centered, it needs to be a tiny bit to the right of that to account for the shape. No separation between the buttons means you can't see the bounds which the words are centered in, so it looks off. The 8 and 10 have the same problem, for the same reason. A visible background-gray line between the buttons would solve this problem, it should be 'squircled' to make it I-shaped and match the outer edges. reply furyofantares 6 hours agoparentprevInteresting.

And if you happen to be using a particular kind of screen and possibly wearing glasses, that little X kind of wanders around in the button, appearing just slightly off center in a maddening way. Made only more maddening by the glasses component: https://www.robbert.org/2014/10/the-off-center-close-button/. That post points out it’s probably just subpixel stuff causing the issue, but I think my thick, cheap glasses at the time were adding a layer of chromatic aberration to something that was already visually confusing. I assume it’s kind of gone away at this point with all the high DPI screens these days. But I remember thinking at the time, if there was a public bug tracker, that issue would be a fun one. reply mrob 12 hours agoparent>More expensive lenses have a coating to compensate for this chromatic aberration. You can't compensate for chromatic aberration with a coating. You need a compound lens made from multiple elements each with a different dispersion, e.g.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achromatic_lens More expensive glasses lenses usually have worse chromatic aberration than cheap ones. The cheapest material for glasses lenses (PADC, often called by the brand name CR-39) has one of the best Abbe numbers (measure of dispersion). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CR-39 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbe_number reply w4rh4wk5 9 hours agorootparentI can confirm this. I had annoyingly bad chromatic aberration with my previous glasses. I specifically asked for CR-39 lenses for my next set of glasses and now it's barely noticeable at all.

To me, it felt fatiguing every time I noticed differently colored words scrolling slight further than other words on a terminal screen on the same line. reply agent86 8 hours agorootparentOne thing to keep in mind is that CR-39 is not impact resistant. They will shatter and can do horrible things to your eyes when they do. Kids should always be put in impact resistant lenses. If you’re a desk jockey, or impact resistance is not a concern, CR-39 will give the least aberration with the exception of crown glass. The hidden hack here if you need/want impact resistance is to ask for Trivex lenses. Same impact resistance as polycarbonate but much better ABBE value. It’s often overlooked because it costs a little more than polycarbonate and most people don’t complain about the distortion. Also, anecdotally, you get what you pay for with progressive lenses.

I'm not sure if I should be happy or worried. reply cubefox 4 hours agorootparentprevI thought I got used to the color fringes in my glasses, but the real problem is that they actually reduce image clarity away from the center of the lenses. If you look e.g. at white text on a dark background from an angle, the chromatic aberration blurs (the color components of) the letters together. You can't really see clearly by moving the eyes to the edge of the FoV of your glasses; you have to turn your head instead. This is directly contradicting the main purpose of glasses: to see clearly. So it's actually somewhat less safe to e.g. drive with glasses that have major chromatic aberration.

It’s one of the things I miss most when using other desktops, particularly those that go maybe a little too far on the minimalism thing (like GNOME).

While macOS is great for the users it caters to (that only use a handful of apps), it’s not for people that use their computers as computers (making it do pretty much everything). reply jwells89 3 hours agorootparentIt’s kinda tough, because a clean-cut, coherent vision of how the OS is intended to be used is necessary to build a great experience. The more you try to accommodate ways of usage beyond that, the more the vision falls apart and you end up with checkbox waterfalls and branching tunnels of config dialogs added in the pursuit of making everybody happy. So realistically, judiciousness is required to keep it all glued together, and some usage patterns just won’t be accommodated. For example, Apple doesn’t seem to be bending over backwards to make former Windows users happy, because the way that desktop works is just too different from what they’ve envisioned and what their long time users are used to. If they add a series of toggles to support Windows usage patterns, that’s a sudden 2x multiplier on the behaviors and UI that needs to be tested. That said, I don’t necessarily agree with all of Apple’s decisions (I’ve never liked the linear representation of virtual desktops that in place since 10.7 Lion that well and preferred 10.6’s Snow Leopard’s 2D grid, for example), but the lines have to be drawn somewhere. reply sph 7 hours agorootparentprevThat gap provides contrast and separation between two similarly-coloured-but-not-quite grey objects.

I guess a wide monitor has you looking at things off-axis more. It is really remarkable how much you can make the X dance around the red circle by moving your head. There's something about the colours and simplicity of that particular icon that really cause the effect. The effect is almost non-existent if you're looking at a more complex image, so I guess it's also remarkable how much your brain compensates for chromatic aberration in most contexts. reply hedora 4 hours agoparentprevMy glasses cause a bit of chromatic aberration, but not enough that I'd expect to see this sort of effect except at the edges of their field of view. Now that you point it out, the X is way off center on my up-to-date M2, so I took a screenshot with default display settings and zoomed in to look at the pixel work. The X is rendered asymmetrically. It appears to be about 0.1 pixels too far to the left and down, since the antialiasing has shaded pixels \"outside the X\" but only on those sides. The antialiased render of the red circle is symmetric. This matches what I see without zooming in and rules out my glasses. I wonder if someone fixed the bug for low-dpi displays where subpixel rendering mattered a lot, but did so in a way that hard-coded whatever Apple shipped 10 years ago. Maintaining tall piles of hacks is hard. Alternatively, maybe their font renderer is getting wobbly in its old age.

What's happening is that your glasses are bending light at different angles depending on the wavelength, to the red and blue and green are landing at slightly different places on your retina.

Some come close on a few of those points but if you want official linux support your choice is very limited.

On macOS I'll use Spotlight (Cmd+Space) to do some quick math. For example, press Cmd+Space, type \"1.2+3.4\", and it sort of displays 4.6. Now to copy the results you either have to click the copy option in the dropdown, using your mouse (no thanks), or press enter to get the results in Calculator. Assuming you last left the calculator in \"Programmer\" mode the calculator displays the value \"4\". Ideally, pressing enter in Spotlight would simply replace the text in the input bar with the result. The equivalent Alt+Space tool in KDE (Plasma Search) performs math this way and it's amazing. I haven't used Quicksilver or Alfred in a decade but I'm sure they do the right thing, too. Otherwise both Spotlight and Plasma Search are both pretty great. Type something like \"14oz to lb\" and they both display the result (though Plasma Search displays the exact \"0.875 pounds\" while Spotlight displays the rounded \"0.88 pounds\"). Overall I'm mostly disappointed with first-party Apple software. Being one of the richest companies in the world I have higher expectations. reply NaOH 22 minutes agoparentI run an older version of macOS, but it's historically been the case that Command-C copies the result of a calculation entered in Spotlight.

At the edges of the font is not a solid line, but rather more like every other pixel so that the characters can be closer together. This causes the up/down movement of one character to the next, as they fit together like poorly made puzzle pieces.

Kerning is strictly about the relative spacing between two adjacent glyphs. The only case that would ever be vertical is if you’re writing vertical lines (such as in Chinese or Japanese). reply johnwalkr 10 hours agorootparentInteresting... I'm in Japan and I was about to reply that Chinese and Japanese are almost always fixed-width, but luckily I grabbed a product next to me (laundry detergent) covered in Japanese. I was expecting to see perfect line-up of characters on adjacent lines proving they are fixed-width. They aren't even close, and this is true for both vertical and horizontal text on everything I look at. I opened a few apps like word and confirmed by default everything is fixed-width.

I'm not talking about initial quality but rather about \"mature\" quality, i.e., the current public versions almost a full year after a major release. I was just talking about this yesterday: somehow TextEdit on Mac has been wrecked. TextEdit, which is essentially a wrapper around NSTextView, was more or less \"perfect\" 15-20 years ago. Now I experience a bug where the window is blank when I open a document until I click inside a window, and scrolling performance in a long document is atrocious. For example, if I try to scroll backward, from the end of the document, it stutters and can lose my place. This doesn't depend on the document; it happens all the time. I guess that Apple rewrote everything a few years ago with TextKit 2, and it shows, but not in a good way. The impression I get from Apple is that Craig Federighi has given engineers license to keep churning out new features and not worry much about bugs, or design, or the user interface. And if something becomes a massive problem, they just pause on features for a couple of weeks, which is like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. reply rustybolt 6 hours agoprev> I would contact Apple, if there was a feedback option, but there isn’t This is infuriating and the same for all the big companies (at least Google, Microsoft, Apple); you have a serious issue and simply no way to talk to a representative. The best you can do is post something on Hacker News and hope it somehow gets picked up. I worked at a company that paid Microsoft a lot to have a 1-day SLA for support. When I contacted them, I got a reply back weeks later saying \"hey sorry I missed your email\". About two weeks later (which was the time it took to email back and forth), it was clear that I had to insert another ticket and mark the subject as something else (that was not directly related, but apparently the team responsible for that subject was also working on the functionality I found a bug in. There was no way for me to know this since it was something internal to Microsoft). So, I had to go through the whole procedure again.

NL – Article speedbump Email * Sign up for free If you are human, leave this field blank. Explore Crows and ravens, which belong to the corvid family, are known for their high intelligence, playful natures, and strong personalities. They hold grudges against each other, do basic statistics, perform acrobatics, and even host funerals for deceased family members. But we keep learning new things about the savvy of these birds, and how widespread that savvy is among the corvid family. Earlier this year, a team of researchers from Lomonosov Moscow State University in Russia and the University of Bristol found that a species of crow called the hooded crow—which has a gray bust and black tail and head feathers, making it look like it is wearing a “hood”—is able to manage a mental feat we once thought was unique to humans: to memorize the shape and size of an object after it is taken away—in this case a small piece of colored paper—and to reproduce one like it. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . This kind of feat, according to animal behavior researchers, requires the ability to form “mental templates.” Essentially, a mental template is an image in the mind of what a particular object looks like, even when that object is not present. Mental templates allow animals to create tools, which can be used to get food or make a stronger nest, both ultimately leading to a better chance of survival. They might also make it possible for individuals to learn about tool making from other members of their species—and to pass along improvements in tool making over time, often called “cumulative culture,” which so far seems rare among non-human animals. Young crows learn how to make different types of tools by stealing their parent’s tools. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . We have been looking for evidence that different corvid and other bird species can create mental templates since at least 2002. That year, researchers published findings showing that Betty, a captive New Caledonian crow, was able to spontaneously bend a piece of wire to create a hook that she could use to grab a hard-to-reach treat. Betty had successfully used a pre-made hook to obtain the treat in earlier trials but in follow-up tasks didn’t seem to fully understand how hooks work. The researchers decided she must have formed a mental template of the hook, which she then reproduced. So far, researchers have found that Goffin cockatoos, a kind of parrot, can also create tools spontaneously, which could indicate similar mental agility. But the new hooded crow findings suggest that the ability to learn this way could be more widespread than we thought, says Sarah Jelbert, a comparative psychologist who studies animal behavior at the University of Bristol and is one of the authors of the study. Creating and using mental templates might be a skill that evolved in the ancestor of all corvids, the “Corvida” branch of songbirds, or perhaps it is even shared more broadly across the animal kingdom, she says. For their study, Jelbert and her colleagues first trained three hooded crows—Glaz (15 years old), Rodya (4 years old), and Joe (3 years old)—to recognize pieces of paper of different sizes and colors. To do this, they exposed the birds to “template” pieces of paper in different colors and sizes for several minutes before removing them—and then rewarded the birds for dropping scraps that matched these templates into a small slit.

The researchers found that all three crows manufactured objects that matched the original template object they had been rewarded for in both color and size—even though the treats in this second stage of the experiment were awarded at random. The researchers also observed that Glaz, the oldest of the three hooded crows, seemed to be the most proficient at making scraps that looked like the ones the bird was trained on. This finding suggested to them that mental templates may be linked to experience garnered with age. “Unlike humans, who regularly copy each other’s behavior … we don’t have much evidence that crows will watch each other and deliberately copy what another crow is doing,” Jelbert says. However, they will steal each other’s tools—in particular, juvenile crows often steal their parents’ tools when they are young. So it’s possible that young crows learn how to make different types of tools from experience stealing their parent’s tools, using them, remembering what these tools look like, and then trying to create something similar, Jelbert says. What qualifies as a mental template, and how flexible these templates are, seems to be up for some debate. Research suggests birdsong and mating practices may rely on certain kinds of mental templates, which can backfire if a bird memorizes behavior from the wrong species. “For example, if a song sparrow gets imprinted on the song of a swamp sparrow and sings a song from a different species rather than its own, it will have difficulty finding mating partners,” explains Andreas Nieder, a professor of animal psychology at the University of Tübingen and a lead researcher on corvid neuroscience, who was not involved in this study. “Similarly, if one finch species gets sexually imprinted on another, it may show courtship displays to the wrong species in adulthood.” Nieder says this kind of imprinting can become fixed in the bird’s brain, and is not changeable even in new environments. “In this case, templates may no longer represent intelligence but rather the opposite,” he adds. Researchers have not yet determined whether mental templates related to tool making remain flexible, though there is some evidence in New Caledonian crows that they may evolve.

For biologists and comparative psychologists, understanding the ways corvids use mental templates can help to illuminate not just the nature of bird intelligence, but of intelligence across the animal kingdom and evolutionary time.

    "commentBody": "Crows are even smarter than we thought (nautil.us)461 points by dnetesn 20 hours agohidepastfavorite253 comments milleramp 14 hours agoWhen I was little I had a small bb gun and would shoot cans in the backyard. A couple times i shot a crow and it would bounce off their strong chest and they would fly off seemingly unfazed. One time by pure chance I hit a crow in the neck and it died instantly, crashing down into my neighbor's yard. It was very shocking because I had not killed anything like that before. Immediately crows started circling my parents house, making an incredible amount of noise. I was so scared, I jumped over the fence to retrieve the dead crow. At this point crows started to dive bomb me and I thought for sure the whole neighborhood must know what is going on. I buried the crow in the backyard and the crows continued to be in high places around the house making noises until evening. The coordination and the intentional effort they made to disrupt and stop me was something I have never forgotten. This had a big effect on me, I thought of it's family, and how they were trying to protect it. Needless to say I have not shot another bird since. reply snet0 4 hours agoparentThis is a hard way to learn it, but I think the recognition of non-human animals as being alive in the same way we are is quite a profound moment. Just that realisation of this thing that was previously just a robotic, animated part of \"the natural world\", like a blade of grass that can move, suddenly being - in its own way - related to itself and others of its species. People find this easy with pets, I guess, but I think the moment you recognise a farm or wild animal as being of a similar kind as you, it can really change your perspective. reply zackmorris 2 hours agoparentprevIf only billionaires could learn such life lessons: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jimmy-john-liautaud-huntin... reply whamlastxmas 5 hours agoparentprevI had a similar experience when I was a kid shooting a .22 and was like “no way I can hit this bird” and totally did.

First and last time I’ve ever thoughtlessly harmed an animal reply jimmytucson 17 hours agoprevThe article title perhaps mischaracterizes the significance of these findings. The paper finds that Hooded crows—who are not specialized tool users—demonstrate some of the same abilities that have already been observed experimentally in New Caledonian crows—who are specialized tool makers, including: the ability to manufacture tools from novel materials, select or manufacture a tool depending on the specifics of the task, …etc. The authors cite a dozen papers published over the last 20 years that have documented these findings in NC crows, as well as Goffin’s cockatoo (who, like the Hooded crow, are not specialized tool users). The significance of this paper must be that the abilities are more widespread in crows than previously thought, which is stated in the article, but blotted out by the juicier headline.

One of them flew down and tumbled, his friends started laughing something fierce. His friends then all took turns mimicking his tumble in the grass, you can just tell they were laughing.

We put food out on leafs (banana is hard to find, peepal or turai squash leaf does the job). It's mostly eaten by crows. It is believed that ancestors visit you back as crows. I never saw local crows doing extraordinary \"smart things\". They were very good at stealing food: especially butter during winter. But never heard about a crow opening a latch. While nesting, they will dip a dry branch in water to make it soft so that they can bend it without breaking when making nest. I never liked crows as kids. They would often kill small squirrels (chipmunks rather) and sparrows whom I liked very much -- though rarely. reply jumploops 18 hours agoprev> This kind of feat, according to animal behavior researchers, requires the ability to form “mental templates.” Essentially, a mental template is an image in the mind of what a particular object looks like, even when that object is not present. As someone with aphantasia, can I get points for recreating something I've seen _without_ having an \"image in the mind\"? reply Terretta 16 hours agoparentAs another, I thought \"mental template\" is the perfect term, since it's neither image nor visual. I assume (since you mention points), you can recreate a geometric drawing (say, a floor plan, or a bicycle*)? What would you call that if not drawing from a mental template? * It seems, at least with bicycles, some people who do this \"visually\" are terrible at it: https://www.wired.com/2016/04/can-draw-bikes-memory-definite... ... I look at those, and think, how T.F. do they think that would work? Then I realize they aren't thinking how it works to draw it, they are drawing what they see and they don't look at things closely enough to understand their shape. reply jumploops 15 hours agorootparentI actually quite like the term “mental template” but then they immediately equated it to an image. The best way I can describe my aphantasia is that I think about objects three dimensionally. There’s nothing visual about it, but I can think about the relation of “points” (really surfaces) in terms of the whole. reply Terretta 2 hours agorootparentYes. I think this is one that is non-euphemistically \"differently abled\". Given a choice, I would trade the postcard recall ability for the ability to multi-dimensionally map concepts and then \"see\" the gaps, as if a periodic table missing some elements, so you know what key areas need working on even though (because) they aren't in evidence. reply Retr0id 17 hours agoparentprevI'm curious, could you describe your mental process of recreating a shape you've seen before? (via drawing, I suppose) I would of course start by visualising it in my head, but I know that's not how aphantasia works. reply sfink 16 hours agorootparentAs another someone with aphantasia, I remember what something looks like, so I draw what I remember. That memory is not an image, it's knowledge of what something looks like. For simple things, that's enough. For complicated things, I sketch out what I remember of the overall appearance, look at it and gauge how far off it is and what is off, and add in details to gradually reduce the difference. I'm not a very good artist, so it'll always look kind of bad, though oddly it doesn't feel like aphantasia is all that much of an obstacle to my ability to draw. It's more just skill in making things look \"right\", skill that is learnable and seems like is necessary to learn by anyone, include those without aphantasia. It's difficult to communicate to someone without aphantasia, because to them apparently the memory of what something looks like is an image. It's similar to the question about whether I dream in color. I mean, I dream in color just as much as I read in color. If asked, I could tell you what color something is. It's part of my knowledge of what that thing looks like. But knowing what color something is and seeing the thing in color are definitely not the same. I don't dream in images at all. I certainly don't dream in \"black and white\". Colors and grayscales only have meaning in an image. (And maybe it's just me, but if the color of something never strikes me as an important characteristic, I will have no memory of what color the thing is. Right now, I couldn't tell you what color the walls of the next room over are, despite seeing it every day. Even though I could probably roughly model the entire room and get the dimensions and positions of everything about right.) Though I'm skeptical that \"normal\" people are as restricted to images as their descriptions often imply. Not everything is 2D, so memories are going to have to include at least some shape information. And I'm sure you have all kinds of associations of the texture and feel of things you visualize, and if it's prickly how much it would hurt to bump into it or hold it in your hand. Memories are rich multi-sensory things, and they aren't just limited to point-in-time sensations either. reply bigyikes 16 hours agorootparentInterestingly, your description of remembering what something looks like matches my experience exactly, but in my dreams I see vividly.

I draw a square by knowing that squares are closed objects with four equal length sides that meet at 90 degree angles. I don’t think that explicitly every time, but regardless there's no visual stimuli. reply hiracat 15 hours agorootparentprevThat's an amazing description, I don't have aphantasia, but that made me understand what it could be like. reply squidbeak 9 hours agoprevCompare with the significantly more limited brains and existences of the idiots who massacre them as a hobby. https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/misguided-slaug... reply bane 15 hours agoprevI think I've come to an inevitable conclusion that there appears to be at least two \"sources\" of intelligence, genetic, and (I guess for lack of a better word), \"learned\". Learned could mean all kinds of things, the capacity measurement of IQ, the effort by parents to fill that capacity, social normative steering, whatever. But genetic really means \"instinct\" in the way that a day old deer can stand, run, graze (I live in an area with lots of deer, so I get a first-hand chance to observe them). Suppose a sci-fi story, where humans encounter a fantastically advanced alien species. Over the course of the story events occur where individuals in the alien species see not learn anything at all, while later generations seem imbued with those same learnings. What humans are encountering might be instead incredibly advance, and highly encoded instinct. Is that not intelligence? I'm reminded of the schools of buddhism, where a differentiation is that you are able to achieve enlightenment in one-lifetime or in many. The main distinction between life and non-life appear to be the ability to experience the universe. A blade of grass is alive no different than a human, but entirely different from a rock. Experience seems to be some kind of basis for intelligence, without which it cannot exist, thus perhaps, all experiential beings are intelligent in some way.

This to me is the opposite of intelligence.\" Frankly, you don't have enough information for that conclusion. First of all, from a bird's point of view, we are massive, clumsy and extremely powerful creatures the size of a 10-story building. If I had to live around such creatures, I would keep my distance just in case. Something that big can hurt you even without intending to do so. Second, you don't really know if they can trust you. It is entirely possible that someone else in your neighbourhood / region fed them, gained their trust, then hurt them (or maybe \"just\" captured them for some time etc., an ornithologist would do). In that case, once bitten, twice shy. Most long-lived smart birds probably witnessed their kin being killed by humans; people would be expected to suffer from a bit of PTSD after that. Third, there may be other factors at play. For example, you might smell bad to them. We generally underestimate olfactory impressions, but few of us would love to be close friends with someone who smelt strongly of, say, gasoline. Personally, I have the experience that ticks avoid me, I had just three in my entire life, approximately once in a decade, even though I go to nature fairly frequently and Czech woods are infested like hell.

Which supported our unabashed exploitation of countless species. It is now abundantly clear that animals have their own phenomenological experience of the world, and their intelligence is part of a continuum, shaped mostly to survive in their niches. And some species demonstrate a higher level of general intelligence - something in which we are quite easily the best.

I mean, we do have moral values about animal rights, but they start with the animals we actually relate to (pets) and are in essence human rights by proxy. Then out of a sense of consistency we try to extend these rights to all the wild animals, many of them busily eating one another and blatantly not caring about nice things or participating in our value system. reply literalAardvark 11 hours agoparentprevAs far as I can tell, current theories are that animals are also somewhat conscious and intelligent, but that we're all, including humans, automata, with zero or near zero free will. reply card_zero 10 hours agorootparentI don't even know what that means or why it worries people, I think it's a big red herring. (And near-zero is a confusing concept.) We're machines that make choices, spontaneously and deterministically (which is not a contradiction). People fretting about free will are getting caught in some kind of category error that confuses the physics of time with being controlled by an invisible tyrant. reply hnfong 8 hours agorootparentLaw is one practical aspect of free will that people generally don't talk much about. For example, criminal law generally assumes people have free will, and thus should be responsible for their actions. If we take the stance that people are in fact merely deterministically doing what they are fated to do given circumstances, some of the punishments doled out to convicts might make people feel uneasy. (Eg. if being poor made the person commit theft... shouldn't we tackle the issue of poverty instead of locking up starving people?) Contract law also assumes people are free to make agreements. Like, signing a contract with onerous terms because that's the only option a person has to avoid something worse. In short, free will provides a kind of cop out for moral philosophers to blame individuals for their own failures. You may or may not agree with this approach, I'm not advocating for or against, but anyway that's one of the practical consequences of free will. reply card_zero 8 hours agorootparentFunny, to me it seems people talk about this one a lot. And the same answer applies. Yes, we have free will and responsibility (because we can respond). Also yes, we do what we do because of physical mechanisms which means you could say we're \"fated\" (leaving aside the irrelevant complication of chance and probability). However, the law is only concerned with people doing (codified) wrong. It lets people off for being insane, because dealing with insanity falls outside of its mission. And similarly it can let people off on compassionate grounds, if for instance they stole food due to being hungry due to poverty. Punishing people for bad luck isn't its mission either. And a contract signed under duress isn't supposed to be valid, because the law's mission isn't to enable formalized bullying. Of course in reality the law is sketchy, lacks compassion, fails to recognize forms of duress. But generally speaking the idea is that it's restricted to the bad things a person freely did, as opposed to things that happened to the person. So then you might say, well, do we freely do anything at all, because it's all just physics and mechanisms. But a lot of the mechanisms are in our brains, thinking sanely (if immorally), so yes, we do act freely, when not coerced. It's important to separate the part of fate which is the things we're probably going to think, which is our responsibility, from the part of fate which is the things that the outside world is probably going to do to us, which is outside of our responsibility. reply hnfong 3 hours agorootparentI'm not sure I get your point -- it looks like you're starting from the conclusion that people do have free will, which of course does not create problems I mentioned. What I was trying to say is that if one believes determinism is incompatible with the concept of free will, then they cannot think the law is fair because nothing has free will. And I'm hypothesizing that people who think that way might be a bit queasy about determinism etc. FWIW, I personally believe free will exists for reasons outside the scope of this discussion, and I doubt it's necessary to conclude first whether it exists or not to get my original point across... reply card_zero 18 minutes agorootparentOh, right.

If whale songs and crow language could be written down in discrete symbols, we could figure them out too. And with higher intelligence we assume that the symbolic language of mathematics will be a universally shared starting point. The kind of analog pattern-matching required to decipher animal language seems to be notoriously difficult to do if your brain doesn't already come with the right analog \"circuits\". I definitely hope that we'll have an AI breakthrough at some point that can decipher animal language, however. One thing's for sure though -- it won't be LLM's since they operate at a symbolic level. reply keiferski 13 hours agoparentprev“Science? Nonsense!

A crow attacked me out of the blue. Distracted by the attack, the back door slammed shut behind me. Since my key was only good for the front door, I had to walk around the building. That damn crow followed me the entire time, dive bombing my head, and screaming bloody murder at me. It was a little spooky. When I finally got back inside and upstairs, I went and looked out the living room window, which looked out the same direction as the back alley. The crow had flown back around and was at the 8th floor looking in the window, from the other side of the pigeon netting we had on our balcony. On the inside of the pigeon netting, was another crow, desperately trying to figure out how it could escape. Not really sure how it had got itself through the pigeon netting in the first place. I went out and sliced a hole through the netting and the trapped crow quickly joined its mate outside, who finally stopped screaming bloody murder. To this day it still amazes me that the crow's mate, knew which apartment I lived in and spotted me downstairs. reply natmaka 16 hours agoparentWe should establish that the crow would only 'attack' any human living in this flat (and neglect any other human walking by this back alley). reply hashmal 11 hours agorootparentIt has been established already that crows remember human faces for years, that they mourn, and that they attack people they associate with the death of their mates (while being quite friendly with other people they know well). reply WalterBright 11 hours agorootparentprevAbout 6 eagles live nearby.

In larger birds comparable to a Rottweiler’s jaw in power. They also have a ratchet-like behaviour, so the bird has to actually want to let you go once you have been grabbed, and struggling usually only makes the bird grip harder reply jakeogh 10 hours agorootparentOh yea, their claws are wild. I got to experience the Tucson Desert Museum demo[0] (it's still going, but this was 16+ years ago)... it's amazing. The falconer had a leather covered arm even though the bird is a close friend. They are smart AF, but watch out for the beak too if it's injured/scared. A vet told me, if you handle a raptor, protect your hands, they can take a chunk. Same goes for long billed birds[1].

For handling most of the birds a falconer's glove is okay but for the bald eagle we have a long leather guard for the whole arm - it's actually a boot that someone cut the foot off. A couple of the handlers describe being seriously gripped by a bird - you just have to keep still and grin and bear it until the bird decides to let go. I got a scratch on the side of my head once from a black kite that 'clonked' me with its talons as it flew past but this was just messing about, not a serious attack. One other thing is how I would feed the birds. Some of them (e.g. a hooded vulture) I would pass food to their beak with my bare hand but with other birds this would be a good way to lose a finger. Also, their Egyptian vulture likes playing with shoe laces (undoing them by pulling) and also tugging on leg hair if you are wearing shorts.

I was wondering about the opposite too. Could you train a crow to watch you throw a marker, say a pebble of specific color, and then fly to the location it landed to perform specific action? Say, if we go for personal mischief instead of warfare: - red marker = find whatever interesting object there is (e.g. man-made things it can carry, or money), and fetch it; - blue marker = grab a payload from you and deposit it at location (e.g. a piece of paper, a \"stinky bomb\") - orange marker = hover over location for a while, or explore it (useful with e.g. crow-mounted camera; throw marker over a fence or on a roof, get footage of place you can't get to) - violet marker = make noise, scare away meanest looking people or animals near target (say, to chase away partying college students that decided to occupy the nearby children playground before sundown, or to remind the neighbor blasting his car radio at 5:30 in the morning that there exists small children, or decency, or noise rules) (both totally random hypothetical scenarios, yes); alternatively, to patrol the area for a while and make noise if people show up; - rose marker = find nearest switch or lever, flick it; Etc. Of course the crow would need to be trained to fetch the marker back after executing the action, as to prevent accidental repeat actions, make markers reusable, and ensure there's no evidence left behind :). reply ChrisMarshallNY 10 hours agorootparentI suspect they would be difficult to train, because of their attitude. We see this with many wild animals. Dogs train easily, but coyotes and wolves, who are even smarter, are much more difficult to train.

Basic operant conditioning probably won't cut it. But the idea itself came to me after encountering similar thread about crows on HN many years ago - both comments and referenced articles would contain personal anecdotes about human-crow relationships, and from those I gathered that it's possible to kind of befriend a crow (or a group), and teach them behaviors as a kind of play. So, I don't expect it's easy to train crows like dogs and pigeons, where one person \"pre-trains\" them and gives/sells them to someone else. But I think it should be possible to \"train\" a crow for yourself - bond with it and have it voluntarily indulge you reliably enough that it's pretty much like training. reply jonplackett 6 hours agorootparentprevIt’s interesting how our view of animal intelligence is massively shaped by the animals we see every day - pets, farm animals, zoo animals.

Especially for use at something like forward operating bases that are always prone to enemy ambushes. Or maybe even using crows to alert of enemy movements. I watched a video earlier today on a YT channel I follow called Curious Droid. This episode went into how the U.S military had a hard time determining vietcong troop movements due to the thick jungle foilege. So DARPA developed this concept of electronic fenses, where the airforce would drop these sensor packages into the jungle. The package would have sesmic sensors and microphones to capture movement of enemy forces through the jungle. The problem was that this being the 1960s/70s - the batteries only lasted couple of weeks. Also data storage and tranmission rates weren't advance enough at the time to send that information to a centralize location far from the contested area. So they had to have an aircraft loitering above to collect this data and then fly the collected data to a processing facility in Thailand. By the time the data was classified and analyized, the intelligence collected wasn't really actionable for the commanders in the field.

There is clearly something different between humans and all other animals. reply anonyfox 11 hours agorootparentBiological Jackpot advantages, or: sheer luck. 1. we do not live underwater, so lots of tools and stuff possible (iE: fire). 2. we have usable hands with thumbs. This allows much better tooling. Ravens only have their beak and are comparatively handicapped in technical developments. 3. we do not die during/after reproduction. This allows for accumulation of knowledge instead of every generation starting to learn from scratch. That’s octopus handicap. 4. we have reasonably enough raw strength and compensate weaknesses with social groups and tools/weapons to eliminate basically all competition where we lived. And managed to increase food production for exponential population growth, again some way of tooling ultimately. … so it for me boils down to the fact that we, among several intelligent species, have been the lucky ones to leverage tooling in the most efficient way. And especially ravens/crows are absolutely in the ballpark of humans when it comes to intelligence. They have actual language to communicate facts to others, they have social structures/rituals similar to ours, they make tools to accomplish goals, even with multi-step-plans. Heck, they even „use“ other animals like wolves: since they are not capable of opening a fresh deer corpse to get to the meat, they search for the nearest wolf and guide him to the corpse for win-win food sharing… some wolf packs have even been seen essentially protecting raven flocks/eggs, so ravens literally can have kinda dogs. reply nkrisc 6 hours agorootparentI agree, it’s likely many subtle, accumulated factors. I think the interesting question, that we may never be able to answer, is whether crow intelligence is such that they could have developed on our trajectory as well, had things been different. Or is our intelligence, while similar to crows and other animals in many ways, fundamentally different in some way? Or was early hominid intelligence middle of the pack and it was just the other factors you mentioned that gave it the edge it needed? reply nradov 18 hours agorootparentprevThat seems true, and yet when we try to pin down specific differences there always seem to be exceptions.

Well, a two year old will carry a stool halfway across the house to reach the scissors that will open a bag of veggie straws :) At 3 they can recognize letters _easily_ and start learning how to read. At 4 they can with a bit of practice learn the piece moves of chess and start strategizing. Animals can definitely be intelligent, and we should learn more about them and how they perceive the world, but when you play with a 2.5 year old for five minute there is no doubt that humanity is beyond special. reply bumby 6 hours agorootparentJust to play devils advocate, I think part of what the OP may be saying is that our intelligence is mapped to our survival. From that perspective, animals can be more intelligent than a 2 year old. A stray cat is infinitely more capable of surviving the wild than a 2 year old human; they are more “intelligent” in that survival capacity by far. So again, to the OPs point, it depends on how we’re measuring intelligence; if it’s based on the skills humans are specialized for, of course humans will be shown to be more intelligent. reply _huayra_ 14 hours agorootparentprevThe real separation (and is something that comes long after 2 years of age in humans) is the ability to observe one's thoughts. I totally get that dolphins and elephants and many \"big brain\" mammals can have social structures, long memories, and the ability to pass down behaviors directly (e.g. \"here's how you hunt fish effectively\" may not be in dolphin genes, but they do a damn good job of it, or also the \"fads\" of orcas like the \"salmon hat\" or, more recently, attacking sailboats).

But a child might steal a tool from a parent and work it out. This demonstrates the problem solving type of intelligence, working out how to reshape a wire to a useful shape for instance. But not a 'higher' intelligence teaching or demonstrating to others. Which is kind of odd, as I see young birds following their parents and imitating and learning. So I guess this shows parent birds don't teach, but young birds instinctively follow around and learn? reply deberon 14 hours agorootparentprevIn the time it took me to learn a new programming language, my kid learned how to be a whole entire human being.

Fawns/calves/... can walk almost as soon as they are born. It takes humans far longer to learn that. If you put a 2-year old human child with every single possible benefit on its own into the wild, its chances of survival are pretty slim. Some creatures never see their parents and thrive. IMHO, humans are special to other humans because we are built to value \"our own.\" We have \"us vs them\" deeply ingrained such that many humans can't even accept that we are also animals. We also tend to value the things we can do over the things other species can do.

Some, like marsupials, are born blind, deaf, with an inability to swallow unaided, looking like weird larvae, and must live in their mother's pockets until they can handle anything. People and cats are like marsupials. As cats get older, their parents teach them survival skills (by showing interest in certain activities that the kittens imitate, not through more explicit instruction; there are cat studies that show this.) It takes kittens probably a year to mostly learn how to be cats. As people get older, we shove a summary and guide to 3000 years of written and tested guidance into them and show them how to brush their teeth properly. It takes about 15 years.

So just because we see a crow using tools, we should not assume that they learn from their parents and experiment and play and refine just like a human. Because it turns out they don't, and we have learned new things about them, and because of these differences, ourselves. So I don't think it that these silly scientists are surprised animals are intelligent. Why waste your life researching animal intelligence if you think your efforts will be pointless? Who in this century actually believes that all animals are unintelligent? The only arguments are to what degree and which species, and maybe quibbling about what that word actually means. But I don't think anyone has demonstrated equivalent to human child levels of cognition yet, with any species. We can teach a child words and grammar and communicate complex and abstract and even imaginary thoughts, and that is just the very beginning. A human child is so incredibly smart it can develop into a human adult. Other species are very different, and claiming equivalence is comparing apples to oranges. We see intelligence in such alien organisms as an octopus or a hive of bees, and the more we learn, in many ways we are understanding that we actually are alone and special.

The tech which a species develops depends a lot on the conditions of their evolution, and encountering wildly different techs that seem miraculous or incomprehensible to one’s own species is fairly common. I think of “intelligence” in a similar vein. We can recognize it when it’s close enough in proximity to the path we humans have taken. The further away another species is from that, the less we are able to recognize/judge their level of intelligence. I like this metaphor because it emphasizes the limits of our own abilities to understand vey foreign things. That’s not to say that we could never get better at it, but there will almost certainly always be more outside of our circle of understanding than inside it.

As for \"dignity\", I am not 100% sure what you mean, but in humans it comes directly with being able to function as a member of the society.

LLMs are trained purely off text, so they are more similar to a very simple animal that only has one type of inputs and outputs like a worm that only knows where its body is and then where it wants to be. LLMs are also only trained for a short period of time, and thats when something interesting is going on and its able to learn and change. We then take a snapshot of it and give it different inputs to get some result instead of to teach it something. I would say that a crow brain that has been frozen and can only get a certain amount of inputs and then only produce a certain amount of outputs is not intelligent. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Chat control is widely popular among some influential parts of the population. After the attempted terrorist attack in Vienna for the Taylor Swift concert the topic didn’t leave Austrian media. A lot of parents are in favor of this independently of terrorism because of fear of CSAM. There is an awful lot of lobbying going on and given history of EU regulation this can only end up passing in the worst possible way at one point. reply caseyy 8 hours agoparentOn the other hand, there are EU countries like Lithuania, which have a very privacy-conscious culture, and have not had any meaningful terror attacks for nearly all their history. The last notable one was 30 years ago[0]. No one died. In Lithuania, privacy is quite meaningfully enshrined in its constitution[1]. I remember that Google StreetView faced significant regulatory challenges in simply photographing people’s homes, and today, many buildings are blurred out. This is only one example. But you can see that everyone takes privacy very seriously in the country. A lot of social engineering-type phishing for personal data does not work because people understand which boundaries cannot be crossed intuitively. More privacy does not mean more terrorism. There may be situations where reducing privacy does reduce terrorism, but privacy is not the cause. I wish governments would rather address the cause.

Just pitch it as a way to fight back against Russia, and it will pass in a jiffy just like all the other anti-russian laws they've been rolling through reply caseyy 6 hours agorootparentI know you are somewhat joking. But there is an undertone of truth in what you say. Oppressive state surveillance in the USSR (commonly verging on persecution of undesirable groups) was a strong reason for countries breaking away from it between 1990 and 1991, when the union collapsed. Lithuania was arguably the first one. The privacy protections we see today are a reaction to some extent, but Lithuanians enjoy them. It was not an over-reaction. It would be wise to use the examples of heavy-handed state surveillance in history in arguments for privacy laws. The US did this to argue for their economic model quite effectively. Whether that ultimately is good — I mean that some people have become so afraid of communism that they can’t agree on some fundamental social welfare systems and duty of care for each other as people — I don’t know. But contrasting liberal capitalism with planned-economy communism was effective in galvanising people towards the former. “Enemy of my enemy is my friend” and all that. reply sevnin 6 hours agorootparentprevAnti-russian? Russia is a major security threat to Lithuania that engages in cyber warfare, disinformation and sabotage campaigns. - Two months ago there were major arson attacks and failed attempts linked to Russians in multiple states like Poland and Germany. - Russian linked agents at the beginning of school year dissiminated false information about bombs being planted at schools in Lithuania which disrupted the process in general and undermined trust of parents and children. - They are also constantly creating false narratives about ongoing social events with ant-lithuanian anti-european spin and spreading them online. - Lets also not forget that Russia is constantly using migrants to attack borders of European states. Russians are trying to wage war in every gray area they can find. Why this paragon of free speech (kekw) constantly engages in anti-lithuanian policies? Even more interesting recently they started mapping out locations of optic fibers scattered across the ocean.

It turns off the logical, rational thought centers in the brain, and convinces ordinarily rational people to accept these poorly thoughtout security measures. As a civid duty, you must fight against measures like these that erode security and privacy. It sucks, because the reward is \"nothing\", and you must forever maintain vigilence against constant reproposals. reply zelphirkalt 6 hours agorootparentEven if that argument somehow statistically works/worked, sometimes it should be mentioned: I would rather have some 3 terror attacks more per year, than having privacy of millions invaded and our way of living destroyed, just to prevent those 3 cases. It would be letting the actual terrorists determin how we live, what rights and privacy we are allowed to have. reply tzs 2 hours agorootparent> I would rather have some 3 terror attacks more per year, than having privacy of millions invaded and our way of living destroyed, just to prevent those 3 cases. End to end encrypted chat for the general public has only been available for ~15 years. On the web, SSL is ~30 years old. PGP is ~35 years old.

However there is a lot of very noticeable lobbying about this. Our school has a parent group that organizes events to inform parents about the dangers of social media and online grooming. You will find leaflets, PDFs etc. If you are interacting with those circles you will find folks who made it their life’s mission to protect children and who are lobbying for this. You donut need a large number of people to sway legislation, you only need determined people. reply I_am_tiberius 3 hours agorootparentOk, I'm Austrian and don't know of anyone who would support this.

But still my fav story is from the private sector: In order to \"merry\" digital and paper form data, they set up a system to send paper forms to Swiss post (\"digitization-as-a-service\") who routed them to (afair) Bangladesh where cheap workers (used to a wholly different alphabet) manually transcribed stuff as XML and uploaded it to some ftp directory. We SWEs then were supposed to build automated systems based on that handwritten XML data. Obviously, the cost they reduced with cheap labor they had to pay multiple times to have us building a resilient data ingestion system.

And then organize towards mass protest. And after removing offending politicians from power, push for them to be jailed for violation of civil liberties. Push for local warrants for their arrest or bans that make their lives in Europe highly inconvenient. Tarnish their legacy as officials. Sure these efforts may not succeed but it’s important to make their lives so difficult as to deter others from ever doing this again. None of this is easy, and it’ll be met by the same suppression of protests that has happened in other instances across Europe in the last few years. But I think it’s the only way. There is no shortcut for political pressure. reply Eumenes 4 hours agoprevI wouldn't be surprised if the US intelligence apparatus was pushing for this.

(banks, etc.) They gave me the results of their algorithm for me personally, but refused to describe the algorithm. Results were kinda non-sense, but when I wanted them deleted, they told me that I may have trouble in the future with their clients, due to lack of information on me in their systems. Probably a scare tactic, but still annoying and concerning. reply dijit 8 hours agorootparentprevIt's inevitable to some extent. Maybe not exactly the same as China's, but the \"common understanding\" that your internet persona must be tied to your identity, and that this identity can be scored based on a bunch of criteria. - or that how you spend your money must be trackable and traceable. It will begin to grow out of the places that are already used this way: things like insurances, then will grow towards \"securities\" such as mortgages (\"where do you spend money, does it look suspicious to us?\"), and afterwards to \"luxuries\" such as air travel. Eventually nearly everything will require submission of financial documents and social profiles for nearly everything and only when that's the case: with a whole host of people wasting time on re-validation of the same information and a huge bureaucratic mess; will someone come along and give it a government sponsored name and a centralised point of access and scoring. - and it will be sold as being better than what came before, and it will be. This is how other forms of centralised identification have grown over time, so I'm not pretending to have prescient knowledge of the future. reply Fargren 7 hours agorootparentThis \"inevitable\" spiel is bad for discourse. There are absolutely ways to stop this, and even delaying should be considered is valuable for anyone who believes this is a bad end result. It's one thing to be negative, other to act like everything is determined and resistance is futile. By saying things can't possibly be changed, we make it harder to change them.

A common case is to use other people's accounts(sometimes stolen, sometimes rented) or purchase something like crypto, gold or anything else that is expensive and easy to move. Often times the seller also doesn't know they are selling to a scammer, there's this technique where the scammers will give the account number of a seller to their victim, the victim will wire the money and the scammers at the same time will be pretending to be buyers and claim that they just wired the money and therefore the transaction is complete and they leave with the scammed money laundered in form of something valuable. reply dandanua 3 hours agorootparentSo, in short, scammers can launder money in minutes, but investigators need months to track them and reverse everything.

Parliament passed the new constitution after only nine days of debate. Changes included a restructuring of Hungarian elections, such that more than half of parliamentary representatives would be chosen through single-member, American-style districts (the remainder are determined by a national proportional-vote share). In drawing the new districts, Fidesz abused a rule that allowed the government to vary them in size from roughly 60,000 to 90,000 people. > The new map packed opposition voters into a handful of larger districts, diluting their votes, while pro-Fidesz voters were distributed among smaller districts. This gerrymandered system would allow Fidesz to fall short of a popular-vote majority but still win a two-thirds majority in Parliament—something that happened not once but twice, in 2014 and 2018. > A blizzard of other electoral changes accompanied the redistricting. Each was incremental, and potentially even defensible in isolation. But in combination, the laws erected extraordinary barriers that would keep opposition parties from winning elections. For example, the old system had allowed for a runoff in any district where the victorious candidate got less than 50 percent of the vote. The new system abolished the runoff, allowing a party to win a district with a mere plurality. At the same time, Fidesz created a rule that required national parties to compete in at least 27 single-member districts—even as the party passed laws that made it trickier for small parties to unite on a joint list. The result was that the various opposition parties were basically forced to split the anti-Fidesz vote in many districts, allowing Orbán’s candidates to win with relatively small pluralities. * https://archive.ph/6DiTT / https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/07/wh...

This is true even if they retain significant ties to the relevant state, province, territory, or locality, like having close family there (including kids too young to vote for whom they're a legal parent), owning property there, operating a business there, or being owed a pension controlled by the relevant level of government. And the guarantee of a right to vote from abroad in US federal elections is purely statutory, not constitutional - not to mention it has a few gaps in it, like citizens who have never lived in the US and neither of whose parents last lived in a state that allows the right to vote from abroad to descend to the next generation based on last parental residence.

Again, in our country, we have several different elections (just like in other countries). But in some, you have to vote locally, in others, you can do via correspondence. So when all of them are local only, no harm done. If you can bring your ass to the polling station, that's enough. Nobody is taking your right to vote, it is on you to decide, whether it is worth to you to exercise your right, or not. reply simion314 5 hours agorootparentprevMy initial comment was not clear, by I am referring of Hungarian citizens that are part of other countries like Romania, this people do not have relatives in Hungary, never lived there, will not move there. reply vetinari 3 hours agorootparentIs it still a thing? AFAIK the neighbor countries protested against it as a passport of convenience. Some even made laws, that when you accept such a citizenship, you are going to lose your previous one. That curbed the enthusiasm for such citizenship rather significantly. reply simion314 3 hours agorootparentIt is still a thing, Romania also does the same thing where we give citizenship to Romanians on territories we lost like R. Moldova so would be hypocritical for Romania to complain about Hungary, ,my personal opinion is that is not democratic if someone votes but they or their family are not affected by the vote. It would be like some jerk In UK gifts citizenship to people in ex colonies and then those people as gratitude wll vote for the jerk. reply wkat4242 5 hours agorootparentprevYeah I wish that within the EU we could just vote for the country we live in rather than the one we were born in. It would make so much more sense. reply vetinari 3 hours agorootparentYou can, in the communnal (local) elections. For the parliamentary, it is here for a reason. To prevent voting touristic. The delay of several years -- you have to live several years in the other country -- serves exactly that. reply simion314 5 hours agorootparentprev>Yes, this is what the (modern|progressive|educated|whatever) tell to themselves to fell on high horse in their bubble. Right, the peasants with no education and only watching state TV are clearly the ones without a bias, their children that went to university, got a good job, know english are the one brainwashed by CIA/Israel and the evil LGBTQ. I read so many cases of educated Hungarians or Russians ashamed of the level of brainwashing of their parents. reply vetinari 3 hours agorootparentYes, because the friculins (as in free-cool-in) in their reddit bubbles are so much more clever. Case in point; any discussion involving policits here, on hn. Politologs are face palming at the naivety, when they see an extract. reply simion314 3 hours agorootparentIf you would know Romanian I would share with you links my parents share with me and have you defend that bullshit to prove that my parents are the correct ones when they fall for the online bullshit like medical stuff (or you will claim that this less educated people are wrong when they fall for medical bullshit but when is about election they are correct). Latest link from my father was a clip from some TV channel where some pretend doctor was claiming something super vague that is scientifically incorrect, this time I ignored it since I was not in the mood to try to find evidence that the guy is not a real doctor, that the vague shit is bullshit and find scientific shit to clarify things, and all would need to be in Romanian so he can understand. For this old generation if is on TV or internet and some scammer pretends is a doctor and uses a few medical words they will fall for it, is the same with politics especially blaiming bad stuff on various groups, that stuff works well on the internet. Give me an example where your or a friend uneducated pessant parents were actually correct in this kind of topics then their educated children that know more languages and read more media. reply sharpshadow 7 hours agorootparentprevBtw after Hungary got the Presidency of the Council of the European Union[1] in July Orban made a trip to Ukraine[2] which was fine for the media until he went directly afterwards to Russia and then to China[3] which the media didn’t took very well. To finish off his trip he went to the USA to meet and endorse Trump.[4] The media wasn’t really happy with that either.

They may not be making visits to Moscow to kiss Putin's hand, like Orban did. But the governments of all the major European countries are continually in contact with the relevant parties, and they all want to \"stop the conflict in Ukraine\".

The issue was not too much free speech. https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236... reply starspangled 4 hours agorootparentprevEven if that were true, it can be attributed to lots of things. The ruling class's wars and economic mismanagement, common people feeling disenfranchised and abandoned by politcs, for some examples. In a real utopia it is those things that would be changed, not the peoples' ability to communicate without government eavesdropping on them. reply Tainnor 6 hours agorootparentprevThe debate about a surveillance state isn't the same debate as whether it should be allowed to deny the Holocaust. I know 0 Germans who are bothered by the latter. reply gizmo 7 hours agoprevnext [5 more] [flagged] mrtksn 7 hours agoparentI wonder if this is a copypasta? Something in these lines pops up every time someone in an EU institution proposes something controversial. That someone is usually Ylva Johansson and its quickly striken down but for some reason there's this strange narrative pushed that feels almost automated. WTF is this stuff about EU shutting down nuclear reactors? Complete fantasy world. Are you copy pasting this from somewhere or were you made to believe in on Twitter or something? Please write a response I'm very curious about the roots of this comment. reply AxelLuktarGott 7 hours agoparentprevDo you perhaps live in the US? The EU didn't shut down any nuclear power plants. Local politicians in Germany and Sweden (and perhaps more countries) did. And they were very much elected. I don't think any technocrats would do something that stupid. The EU has elections every five years where the members of parliament are chosen. They very much answer to the public. Why would you think they don't? reply throwaway48540 6 hours agorootparentThe EU considered nuclear energy to not be \"green\" up until very recently, which directly contributed to the demise of said nuclear power plants as well as many potential projects. reply raverbashing 7 hours agoparentprev> Who in their right mind shuts down their nuclear power plants and exchanges energy independence for cheap gas imports from Russia?

Of course, some people leave the EU every year. reply aruggirello 5 hours agoparentprevWhere? reply seydor 7 hours agoprevthe chat control is one thing we need in order to make a great leap forward towards a safer EU. It's probably one of the most consequential pieces of high-tech that the EU ever created. We should all be thankful that it exists and not let a minority of lawyers prevent the future. Our basic freedoms can only be guaranteed with an extensive surveillance system to (preemtively?) remove bad actors in these perilous times. Some EU countries are way ahead in this direction, and one could say they lead the way to the future. For example Greece has repeatedly used the Predator malware to spy on the communications of hundreds of people, including the leader of an opposition party (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Greek_surveillance_scanda...). As a result, millions of tourists flocked into the country in the following years, and everybody says it is great. reply dt3ft 8 hours agoprev [–] It is back on the agenda because it is necessary. Open Telegram app, tap on Contacts tab (still inside Telegram app), then tap on \"Find People Nearby\". What I get here in Spain after doing the above, is a buffet of people and chat groups, with literal menus of illegal substances with photos of their \"products\" (delivery 24/7) and even weapons. In Sweden, there are chat groups where hits on people are and have been ordered and executed. When authorities asked for support from Telegram to hunt down the people (drug cartels) behind these chats, they were met with silence or refusal. Why should drug cartels have free and EASY access to such wonderful encrypted sales platform? Isn't it time to update the law and catch up with tech? reply tigeroil 8 hours agoparentThis is not a good argument as to why we should break encryption. Rather, it's an argument that law enforcement should start engaging with those groups on telegram directly, i.e. setting up stings etc and just actually go and catch them. Do some good old police work. If you're able to find them on telegram, clearly law enforcement are capable too, if they're resourced and willing. Encryption isn't the problem here. reply amarcheschi 8 hours agoparentprevThe chat you are referring to aren't encrypted, I don't see how breaking end to end encryption would affect the chat you're talking about. That's a problem that has to do with telegram governance. In telegram, group chats are not encrypted. 1:1 chats are also not encrypted if you don't start a secret chat before Now tell me, if law enforcement can just get into those group since they're not encrypted, why are not they doing that? What do they need to break encryption for? reply dt3ft 7 hours agorootparentThe ordering process is likely handled in e2e 1:1 chat. The public and unencrypted channel is only used as advertising/entry point. The evidence of purchase is as such not accessible to the authorities. reply amarcheschi 7 hours agorootparentI'm not sure whether you need evidence of purchase when you're actively marketing you sell drugs reply the-smug-one 7 hours agorootparentprevE2E 1:1 chat is not going to disappear for the criminals simply because it becomes illegal for the common man. reply jkaplowitz 7 hours agoparentprev> Why should drug cartels have free and EASY access to such wonderful encrypted sales platform? Drug cartels will continue to have easy access to such platforms, as will anyone willing to do business with them, since such cartels and their business partners do not care about following the law. The same is true for child pornographers, hitmen, and so on. The technology exists and does not inherently depend on any middleman amenable to EU authority. No EU legislation can reverse that. All this might do is force them to switch to a different chat provider that will ignore EU law, or to run one themselves. The true effect of any legislation that purports to circumvent end-to-end encryption to address the concerns you list will primarily be reducing the privacy of law-abiding people, including those who really need it: a French journalist reporting on corruption in a public contract bidding process, a Hungarian dissident organizing opposition to Fidesz's authoritarianism, or even someone seeking help to flee from the oversight of an abusive spouse with personal connections to EU member state surveillance institutions. Not a useful way to catch up with tech - whether or not a better way exists, this law is literally worse than doing nothing. reply StrLght 7 hours agoparentprevYour example with Telegram has nothing to do with E2E encryption, which is precisely what Chat Control is aimed at. Please look for a more relevant straw man. reply dt3ft 7 hours agorootparentThe ordering process is likely handled in e2e 1:1 chat. The public and unencrypted channel is only used as advertising/entry point. The evidence of purchase is as such not accessible to the authorities. reply StrLght 7 hours agorootparentPoor law enforcement who are not capable of acquiring evidence via a controlled buy. Better give them access to everyone's private messages, that will definitely solve crimes once and for all. My point it: if shouting \"I am doing something illegal\" in public isn't enough to get law enforcement's attention, how would access to private messages change this? reply aksedfs 7 hours agoparentprev> In Sweden, there are chat groups where hits on people are and have been ordered and executed. Funny that they can pinpoint and read the messages of those groups already without ChatControl. Also, perhaps issues around the demographic in question should perhaps be addressed with other measures. I think they would continue if the entire Internet were shut down. reply marbu 7 hours agoparentprev> Isn't it time to update the law and catch up with tech? In case of Telegram groups you mention, local authorities can use existing laws regulating public social networks (Telegram really works similar to Facebook in these use cases, these telegram groups are neither private nor end to end encrypted). The fact that Telegram doesn't cooperate is not because of lack of regulation, but lack of leverage against it (which seems to be one of the reasons why authorities in France detained Telegram CEO recently). reply minkles 8 hours agoparentprevYeah normal here in the UK as well. I was at a party last year and someone just ordered coke off WhatsApp. This turned into a mess because they wanted to pay the \"menu price\" as advertised and two guys with a shooter turned up and took £500 off them instead of £200. So we have extortion, illegal drug dealing and illegal guns in one fine evening. ChatControl is not the solution however. Reporting it to the police didn't do a damn thing either though so I don't know! reply Djdjur7373bb 7 hours agorootparentThe solution to that problem is simple: legalize the sale of all drugs. Extortion is a common practice of drug gangs, whether they sell online or not. reply minkles 4 hours agorootparentThe social problems, mental health and physical health issues related to cocaine, legal or not, far outweigh the benefits of legalising it. I'll add that my cousin was stabbed 6 times by a coke head flat mate who had a psychotic episode. And I haven't started on the slavery side of the production side of the supply chain. reply pelorat 7 hours agorootparentprevThen you need a system that prevents drug users from getting into vehicles, and also a system that disqualifies them from public healthcare. It's easier to criminalize drug use than to deal with the consequences. reply deergomoo 6 hours agorootparent> you need a system that prevents drug users from getting into vehicles Driving under the influence is already illegal and would obviously remain so in a society where more drugs were legal. I think we mostly all accept that needing to pass a breathalyser test to start your car would be absurd, so why are currently illegal drugs any different? > a system that disqualifies them from public healthcare Why? We don’t exclude obese people, those who do no exercise, smokers, alcoholics from public healthcare. In my eyes that is the bedrock of a public service, you get it whether you “deserve” it or not. To say otherwise opens the door to far too many situations where people cannot get the help they need. reply dt3ft 6 hours agorootparentprevI am for legalization. The state and pension funds should profit, rather than cartels. reply suslik 7 hours agorootparentprev> two guys with a shooter turned up and took £500 off them instead of £200 Did they at least leave the coke? reply minkles 5 hours agorootparentYeah which my poor friend had to watch them snorting off his toilet seat. reply shiandow 7 hours agoparentprevSo by that token FFOS encryption and software using it should not exist? reply dt3ft 7 hours agorootparentSo nuclear weapons are something we should let everyone have? See, it goes both ways. reply shiandow 6 hours agorootparentYou could have just said 'no'. Equating secrecy of letters with nuclear weapons isn't helping your argument. reply Ylpertnodi 7 hours agoparentprev>Why should drug cartels have free and EASY access to such wonderful encrypted sales platform? Why shouldn't they? When i buy drugs it's a whole load of fucking about because they're illegal where I am, but not illegal just 40km away. Free and EASY apps reduce the friction. Win. reply vletal 7 hours agoparentprevYeah. A slippery slope. If you force major apps to comply, smaller apps will pop up. Not sure if you can win this whack a mole. reply jonathanstrange 7 hours agorootparentIt's like with drug dealing on the streets. If you force dealers off the streets, the deals will take place in private apartments that are much harder to surveil. If you force dealers from large social nets to private social nets or even specialized \"underground\" apps, the police work is going to be harder, not easier. reply als0 8 hours agoparentprev [–] > Why should drug cartels have free and EASY access to such wonderful encrypted sales platform? Isn't it time to update the law and catch up with tech? To me, this as ridiculous as saying \"Why should drug cartels have free and EASY access to the internet?\". The genie is out of the bottle, and there is no substitute for good old fashioned (hard) police work. reply dt3ft 7 hours agorootparent [–] Not quite. Finding and ordering drugs using the good old www without \"people nearby\" feature is a big difference, wouldn't you agree?

This month in Servo: tabbed browsing, Windows buffs, devtools, and more! 2024-08-31 Flexbox and WebXR are now enabled by default. A flexbox-based table showcasing some of Servo’s new features this month. Servo has had several new features land in our nightly builds over the last month: as of 2024-07-27, basic support for show() on HTMLDialogElement (@lukewarlow, #32681) as of 2024-07-29, the type property on HTMLFieldSetElement (@shanehandley, #32869) as of 2024-07-31, we now support rendering text typed in(@mrobinson, #32886) as of 2024-07-31, we now support the ‘border-image’ property (@mrobinson, #32874) as of 2024-08-02, unsafe-eval and wasm-unsafe-eval CSP sources (@chocolate-pie, #32893) as of 2024-08-04, we now support playback of WAV audio files (@Melchizedek6809, #32924) as of 2024-08-09, we now support the structuredClone() API (@Taym95, #32960) as of 2024-08-12, we now support IIRFilterNode in Web Audio (@msub2, #33001) as of 2024-08-13, we now support navigating through cross-origin redirects (@jdm, #32996) as of 2024-08-23, we now support the crypto.randomUUID() API (@webbeef, #33158) as of 2024-08-29, the ‘clip-path’ property, except path(), polygon(), shape(), or url() values (@chocolate-pie, #33107) We’ve upgraded Servo to SpiderMonkey 128 (@sagudev, @jschwe, #32769, #32882, #32951, #33048), WebRender 0.65 (@mrobinson, #32930, #33073), wgpu 22.0 (@sagudev, #32827, #32873, #32981, #33209), and Rust 1.80.1 (@Hmikihiro, @sagudev, #32896, #33008). WebXR (@msub2, #33245) and flexbox (@mrobinson, #33186) are now enabled by default, and web APIs that return promises now correctly reject the promise on failure, rather than throwing an exception (@sagudev, #32923, #32950). To get there, we revamped our WebXR API, landing support for Gamepad (@msub2, #32860), and updates to hand input (@msub2, #32958), XRBoundedReferenceSpace (@msub2, #33176), XRFrame (@msub2, #33102), XRInputSource (@msub2, #33155), XRPose (@msub2, #33146), XRSession (@msub2, #33007, #33059), XRTargetRayMode (#33155), XRView (@msub2, #33007, #33145), and XRWebGLLayer (@msub2, #33157). And to top it all off, you can now call makeXRCompatible() on WebGL2RenderingContext (@msub2, #33097), not just on WebGLRenderingContext. The biggest flexbox features that landed this month are the ‘gap’ property (@Loirooriol, #32891), ‘align-content: stretch’ (@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #32906, #32913), and the ‘start’ and ‘end’ values on ‘align-items’ and ‘align-self’ (@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #33032), as well as basic support for ‘flex-direction: column’ and ‘column-reverse’ (@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #33031, #33068). ‘position: relative’ is now supported on flex items (@mrobinson, #33151), ‘z-index’ always creates stacking contexts for flex items (@mrobinson, #32961), and we now give flex items and flex containers their correct intrinsic sizes (@delan, @mrobinson, @mukilan, #32854). We’re now working on support for bidirectional text, with architectural changes to the fragment tree (@mrobinson, #33030) and ‘writing-mode’ interfaces (@mrobinson, @atbrakhi, #33082), and now partial support for the ‘unicode-bidi’ property and the dir attribute (@mrobinson, @atbrakhi, #33148). Note that the dir=auto value is not yet supported. servoshell now has a more elegant toolbar, tabbed browsing, and a clean but useful “new tab” page. Beyond the engine Servo-the-browser now has a redesigned toolbar (@Melchizedek6809, 33179) and tabbed browsing (@webbeef, @Wuelle, #33100, #33229)! This includes a slick new tab page, taking advantage of a new API that lets Servo embedders register custom protocol handlers (@webbeef, #33104). Servo now runs better on Windows, with keyboard navigation now fixed (@crbrz, #33252), --output to PNG also fixed (@crbrz, #32914), and fixes for some font- and GPU-related bugs (@crbrz, #33045, #33177), which were causing misaligned glyphs with incorrect colors on servo.org (#32459) and duckduckgo.com (#33094), and corrupted images on wikipedia.org (#33170). Our devtools support is becoming very capable after @eerii’s final month of work on their internship project, with Servo now supporting the HTML tree (@eerii, #32655, #32884, #32888) and the Styles and Computed panels (@eerii, #33025). Stay tuned for a more in-depth post about the Servo devtools! Changes for Servo developers Running servoshell immediately after building it is now several seconds faster on macOS (@mrobinson, #32928). We now run clippy in CI (@sagudev, #33150), together with the existing tidy checks in a dedicated linting job. Servo now has new CI runners for Windows builds (@delan, #33081), thanks to your donations, cutting Windows-only build times by 70%! We’re not stopping at Windows though, and with new runners for Linux builds just around the corner, your WPT try builds will soon be a lot faster. We’ve been running some triage meetings to investigate GitHub issues and coordinate our work on them. The next Servo issue triage meeting is on 2 September at 10:00 UTC. For more details, see project#99. Engine reliability August has been a huge month for squashing crash bugs in Servo, including on real-world websites. We’ve fixed crashes when rendering floats near tables in the HTML spec (@Wuelle, #33098), removed unnecessary explicit reflows that were causing crashes on w3schools.com (@jdm, #33067), and made the HTML parser re-entrant (@jdm, #32820, #33056, html5ever#548), fixing crashes on kilonova.ro (#32454), tweakers.net (#32744), and many other sites. Several other crashes have also been fixed: crashes when resizing windows with WebGL on macOS (@jdm, #33124) crashes when rendering text with extremely long grapheme clusters (@crbrz, #33074) crashes when rendering text with tabs in certain fonts (@mrobinson, #32979) crashes in the parser after calling window.stop() (@Taym95, #33173) crashes when passing some values to console.log() (@jdm, #33085) crashes when parsing somevalues (@NotnaKO, #32980) crashes when parsing some HTTP header values (@ToBinio, #32973) crashes when setting window.opener in certain situations (@Taym95, #33002, #33122) crashes when removing iframes from documents (@newmoneybigbucks, #32782) crashes when calling new AudioContext() with unsupported options (@Taym95, #33023) intermittent crashes in WRSceneBuilder when exiting Servo (@Taym95, #32897) We’ve fixed a bunch of BorrowError crashes under SpiderMonkey GC (@jdm, #33133, #24115, #32646), and we’re now working towards preventing this class of bugs with static analysis (@jdm, #33144). Servo no longer leaks the DOM Window object when navigating (@ede1998, @rhetenor, #32773), and servoshell now terminates abnormally when panicking on Unix (@mrobinson, #32947), ensuring web tests correctly record their test results as “CRASH”. Donations Thanks again for your generous support! We are now receiving 3077 USD/month (+4.1% over July) in recurring donations. This includes donations from 12 people on LFX, but we will stop accepting donations there soon — please move your recurring donations to GitHub or Open Collective. Servo is also on thanks.dev, and already three GitHub orgs that depend on Servo are sponsoring us there. If you use Servo libraries like url, html5ever, selectors, or cssparser, signing up for thanks.dev could be a good way for you (or your employer) to give back to the community. 3077 USD/month 10000 As always, use of these funds will be decided transparently in the Technical Steering Committee.

I also believe there's the impression that making a brand new browser with an engine written from scratch is not realistic, so why found one? Fortunately Ladybird might have changed things on this front. reply lexicality 9 hours agorootparentWell, this managed to make me feel enough shame to throw $5 a month at them reply guerrilla 8 hours agorootparentprev> There's probably some kind of tragedy of the commons I think you mean the free rider problem. In the tragedy of the commons, a shared resources is depleted. In the free rider problem, it's only that users benefit without contributing. In both cases, the resource is non-excludable (it's public or common in a sense) but in the case of the free rider problem, the resource is non-rivalrous, meaning that consumption by one user does not reduce its availability to another. People using Servo but not contributing it does not exhaust any shared resource that we have access to (i.e. Servo itself). The resources used for its production (and any potential resources that could be) are all private, not common or public. I guess nobody's really using it yet though since it's not really usable so it's not really formally the free rider problem yet either.

    "originBody": "Research UK researchers find Alzheimer’s-like brain changes in long COVID patients By Hillary Smith Friday Research illustration by Tom Dolan. LEXINGTON, Ky (Aug. 30, 2024) — New research from the University of Kentucky’s Sanders-Brown Center on Aging shows compelling evidence that the cognitive impairments observed in long COVID patients share striking similarities with those seen in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The study, published in Alzheimer’s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association, highlights a potential commonality in brain disorders across these conditions that could pave the way for new avenues in research and treatment. The study was a global effort, funded by a multitude of grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the Alzheimer’s Association and international organizations. The project also brought together experts from various fields of neuroscience. Researchers at the UK College of Medicine led the study, including Yang Jiang, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Behavioral Science; Chris Norris, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences; and Bob Sompol, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences. Their work focuses on electrophysiology, neuroinflammation, astrocytes and synaptic functions. “This project benefited greatly from interdisciplinary collaboration,” Jiang said. “We had input from experts, associated with the Alzheimer’s Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART), across six countries, including the U.S., Turkey, Ireland, Italy, Argentina and Chile.” Jiang and the collaborative team focused their work on understanding the “brain fog” that many COVID-19 survivors experience, even months after recovering from the virus. This fog includes memory problems, confusion and difficulty concentrating. According to Jiang, “the slowing and abnormality of intrinsic brain activity in COVID-19 patients resemble those seen in Alzheimer’s and related dementias.” This research sheds light on the connection between the two conditions, suggesting that they may share underlying biological mechanisms. Both long COVID and Alzheimer’s disease involve neuroinflammation, the activation of brain support cells known as astrocytes and abnormal brain activity. These factors can lead to significant cognitive impairments, making it difficult for patients to think clearly or remember information. The idea that COVID-19 could lead to Alzheimer’s-like brain changes is a significant development. “People don’t usually connect COVID-19 with Alzheimer’s disease,” Jiang said, “but our review of emerging evidence suggests otherwise.” The publication in Alzheimer’s & Dementia reveals that the cognitive issues caused by COVID-19 reflect similar underlying brain changes as those in dementia. The study’s insights emphasize the importance of regular brain function check-ups for these populations, particularly through the use of affordable and accessible tools like electroencephalography (EEG). The study not only highlights the shared traits between long COVID and Alzheimer’s, but also points to the importance of further research. “The new insight opens avenues for future research and clinical practice, particularly in studying brain oscillations related to neural biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment in people with long COVID,” said Jiang. One of the key findings is the role of astrocytes — support cells in the brain that have not been as thoroughly studied as neurons. The research suggests that damage or activation of these cells by COVID-19 can cause synaptic dysfunctions, leading to the abnormal brain activity observed in both conditions. This discovery is significant because it may help explain why EEG patterns in COVID-19 patients resemble those seen in the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. Researchers believe this work could have a direct impact on patient care. They are advocating for routine EEG exams to detect early brain changes in both COVID-19 survivors and those at risk for cognitive decline. “EEG patterns in COVID-19 patients resemble those seen in early neurodegenerative diseases,” said Norris. “These similarities may be due to shared issues such as brain inflammation, astrocyte activity, low oxygen levels and blood vessel damage,” said Sompol. By detecting these changes early, health care providers could potentially identify at-risk individuals sooner and implement interventions to prevent or slow the progression of cognitive decline. As research continues, the team is particularly interested in how EEG monitoring can predict long-term outcomes in COVID-19 patients and assess the effectiveness of treatments aimed at preventing cognitive decline.

I tested as borderline COPD, given an inhaler and my lung tests improved dramatically, well into healthy range. However even with the inhaler I still get that \"air hunger\" sensation and the feeling like I cannot get a full breath in.

It's like the resolution on concepts has gone way down. Instead of remembering a specific fact about a specific country (that I recently learned and resolved to commit to memory), for example, it's \"some Middle Eastern country... or maybe it was African, but somewhere over there... did this thing where... something medical. Or maybe scientific.\" It makes socializing really hard. While using my multimeter recently, I convinced myself that voltage and resistance were the same thing, because they both fell into the \"electrical\" bucket in my brain. Even scarier, the double-checking mechanism failed, so that I didn't detect the absurdity for a while. It only resulted in a blown fuse, but I can imagine this kind of confusion having much more serious consequences. As for physically, I just get winded much more easily -- and it's not the kind of winded I used to get, where if I pushed through, my body might complain but gear up to meet the challenge anyway.

Yes, it's likely that some potentially valid advice gets nuked in this regard, but it also captures a lot of the bad. Medical information couched as \"I'm not an expert, here's my experience and some supporting references, your mileage may vary\" tends to fly far better than doubling down on dissing opposing viewpoints or wildly novel and unsubstantiated information. Dang's somewhat adjacent commentary:(in the context of someone requesting that bad medical advice be flagged). My view is that at best HN might raise potential treatments / practices which people should evaluate with a qualified medical professional.

Before you know you've caught it, suddenly you want to go out to dinner, or go to a meetup of friends that you weren't planning on, or go to the movies / a concert. Your misrecognizing faces seems like it might have felt the onus was on you to go up to people you saw and say \"hey how've you been!\" which, if you were infectious, would be detrimental to other people but beneficial to the virus. maybe long-covid or whatever left that part of your brain miswired and it took however long for the brain to fix the feature. reply ben_w 8 hours agorootparentI have a suspicion that, for similar reasons, STDs would also be likely to make people hornier. reply loa_in_ 6 hours agorootparentAs teens would say, \"getting laid will give you a confidence boost and make you feel manlier\".

Just about recovered enough to start doing light cardio again. But during the first 5 months or so my brain was literally scrambled. At Christmas, simple trivia games were impossible. Recall of certain words that were usually available to me just didnt happen. It was awful, especially trying to keep my new job at the time. I also found myself doing things that I'd never done before, like leaving a tap running or heating a pan full of vegetables without any water in, as I'd forgotten I was midway though something. Gradually, I began to get better, and this was in lockstep with my garmin's reporting of my HRV which had massively declined immediately after onset. At my worst, walking up one flight of stairs or showering would have me out of breath and send my heart racing. Before all of this, I was an extremely fit young person (very high VO2 max and exercised daily). Im only just starting to get a resemblance of my former life back and I fortunately only had a mild case but it has really woken me up to the seriousness of post viral syndromes. I now actively avoid _any_ sick people, no matter how mild - my initial infection barely registered as a sore throat and sniffles.

Who knows what long term lasting damage has been done to my body reply Insanity 18 hours agoprevI had Covid once - when people considered the pandemic mostly “over” (early this year). The worst was the brain fog which took weeks to clear up. reply genewitch 13 hours agoparenti've never had covid, and i am unaware if this is in the literature because it may not be directly caused by the virus; but, did you have a lot of trouble sleeping/staying asleep? Anyone can reply, especially interested if you have a fitness band/watch that tracks sleep and breathing/heartrate, if you noticed that your sleep was greatly disrupted by the disease. I had some weird virus a couple weeks ago that didn't seem like it could possibly be contagious, there was no outward symptoms like coughing or whatever. But one of the symptoms was the inability to sleep. I think i got my personal best \"without sleep without any chemicals\" - i wasn't eating much because i wasn't hungry - like at all, so no caffeine or sugar, no medications that would cause sleeplessness. I was up very nearly 43 hours. And i had to force myself to go to sleep, because i knew the auditory hallucinations were going to start soon - i get em, they're more annoying than tinnitus, at around the 45-48 hour mark, and they get progressively worse. Prior to being awake 42 hours, i had maybe 4 hours of sleep total, and leading up to that i had been up over 20 hours - so my sleep was completely ruined. Due to the lack of sleep, i cannot remember anything that happened that week, or the week prior. Nor what i read (i read two books), who i talked to or about what. It's just blank - not fuzzy, not hard to recall, just nothing there. How do i remember any details? i was live-posting about how poorly i felt and why, went back and read them, committed my posts to memory. reply Workaccount2 5 hours agorootparentCOVID, at least strains from a few years ago, were known to cause insomnia.

Dieticians like the one you linked have been coming up with theories for how everything is caused by either too much or too little histamine for years. MCAS is particularly over diagnosed right now. The number of patients who think they have MCAS based on TikTok and Internet forums is so bad that most doctors have no choice but to assume it’s not a real diagnosis unless the patient has actually supporting test results in their file. Usually when you ask an “MCAS” patient how they were diagnosed, you get a long story about how their vague symptoms can be explained by MCAS according to something they saw on the internet. The saddest part of the internet MCAS phenomenon is all of the people on Reddit and TikTok who have been convinced they have MCAS and can’t understand why all of the antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers and special diets aren’t fixing their problems. The fact that they probably don’t have MCAS and histamine doesn’t explain their symptoms just can be accepted after they’ve become immersed in online MCAS communities. reply unyttigfjelltol 6 hours agorootparentI've never heard doctors worry so much I might change my diet as when I read the Wikipedia entry on histomine intolerance.[1] MCAS is one thing, maybe, but the primary diagnostic for histomine intolerance is whether symptoms improve with changes in diet.

In addition to covid, there was the lockdown, and the tripledemic. For example, I had two extremely mild cases of covid, but also long-not-covid symptoms from something worse (probably rsv, flu, or ???). Similarly, there are a ton of psychological/developmental issues among covid-generation kids. For many, the lockdown and school closures were probably the main cause, but some probably have issues from covid itself. reply ETH_start 2 hours agorootparentprev [–] The studies since then that I've seen have been, without exception, low on rigor.

    "originBody": "Rediscovering the Small Web Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement and 'convert'. But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative and interesting. - Parimal Satyal, 25 May 2020 Every website redesign begins with inspiration. For this one, there were two: Anders' clean, readable website, which inspired the homepage, and Marijn's site, which reminded me just how fun the web can be. The colours, graphics, creative navigation, interesting ideas... the simple fact of clicking through the pages of someone's personal website in 2020 made me nostalgic of the web of the late 90s and early 2000s that I grew up with. Some of you might have read my previous article, Against an Increasingly User Hostile Web. In it, I argue that we are replacing an open web that connects and empowers with one that restricts and commoditises people. I talk about how the modern web of surveillance, bloat and walled gardens is at odds with the open web that I love. I was pleasantly surprised by how much the sentiment seemed to be shared by so many other people who emailed me, wrote responses on their own blog and discussed it on online forums. Despite being two and a half years old, that article rather disappointingly still reflects the state of the web today. But stumbling upon Marijn’s site gave me hope. It led me down a rabbit hole of many other small websites made by people with all kinds of interests: movies, aviation, music, art, computers. It reminded me that the creative, personal, fun web I grew up with is not a thing of the past. It’s still here in 2020. You just have to know where to look. My aim is not to convince you that everything was better in the past; it wasn't. You had trojans, malware, endless pop-ups, terrible security practices, browser incompatibility, slow Java applets. No, technically, the modern web is more secure and more usable. This essay is my attempt to show you what the small and independent web can look like, why it’s different from the the sites that dominate web traffic today, why it's worth exploring and how easy it is for anyone to be a part of it. This essay is somewhat long; you might find this table of contents handy: Retro Redesign The First Webpages Masters and Navigators Modern Gatekeepers The Commercial Web (of Marketing) The Product-Oriented Website The Web as a Creative Space Highlights: From the Past Highlights: From the Present Your Own Corner of the Web Retro Redesign On my homepage, I mention that this website is “a tribute to the creative web of the 90s”. This is not simply because this website has animated gifs and a guestbook. The way I built it is also inspired by how I built my earliest websites: everything is written in plain HTML. No content management systems, no generators, no templates, no themes, no plugins. Just plain markup and styling, the most basic of the basic building blocks of the web. I didn’t originally plan to do it like this. I previously used a static site generator to output plain HTML and was simply working on a new design template for that. But my three-year-old node.js setup was now spewing error messages, telling me some dependencies had to be updated and that a plugin was no longer compatible. Because I'm lazy and didn't want to fix any of that, I wondered if I couldn’t just do it all manually instead and save myself the trouble. So I did. I decided to hand-code everything in plain HTML and CSS, manually link all the pages and even hand-write the RSS feed. And to be honest, I haven’t had this much fun making a website since when I first started playing around with Microsoft Frontpage and Adobe Photoshop 4.0 in the late 90s and early 2000s. This approach wouldn't work for a bigger website. But for a small one like mine with about 10 total pages, it has many obvious benefits: next to no dependencies, easy to maintain, reasonably future proof, easily portable and most important of all, terribly fun to work on. I stayed up till six in the morning for two straight days working on the redesign, not because I couldn’t sleep but because I didn’t want to stop. Admittedly, about 30% of that time was spent scouring GifCities.org and the Internet Archive for animated GIFs and backgrounds. (You might notice that each page of the website has a different background, including some with original art by my friend). Redesigning my website this way inspired me to scour archives of old websites for interesting relics from the early web. This in turned led me to the fun, creative websites that are actively maintained even today. To understand what these small websites represent and why I think they are important, we need to start in the past. The First Webpages The web was still in its infancy in the early 90s. You probably know the story. It had only just been invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 and released into the public domain in 1993, making it available for free to anyone in the world to use and build on. In its very early days, it was really only accessible to the more technical crowd, much like Gopher, FTP, Usenet and other internet protocols at the time. It wasn't until the first easy-to-use graphical browser Mosaic was released for free in 1993 that regular computer users would discover the web for the first time. Others like myself discovered it later still when the Mosaic-spinoff Netscape Navigator (the foundation of today's Firefox) and Internet Explorer became commonplace. It was all terribly exciting. Unlike traditional media, you could now speak back and participate. It was the first interplanetary communication system where anyone, anywhere in the world, could make a page and share their thoughts and ideas with the world. Netscape would later even include an editor that let users make webpages visually, the same as using a word-processor (\"WYSIWYG\", as it was called back then: what you see is what you get). The goal was to enable anyone, even those without the technical skills, to put a page up. But if you wanted your web page to be \"on the web\", where would you put it? You needed a web host of some sort to store the pages and share a public address so other people could visit. It would ideally also be free so you could try things for fun without having to think about it too much. That's where Geocities came in, along with other free web hosts like Tripod, Fortunecity and Freeservers. They were perhaps the biggest catalysts to democratising the web. Geocities introduction page from February 1998, accessed via Internet Archive It was so simple, anyone who wanted to could create a free account and build a website to share their hobbies and ideas. And share they did! People made websites about virtually everything: music, philosophy, art projects, ASCII art, candy, and about their lives. A key detail was that most people who made these websites were neither professionals nor companies; they were simply people who wanted to share their interests. Like I did back in 2001 with my unofficial fansite for German metal band Gamma Ray: My Geocities-hosted Gamma Ray fansite from January 2001, accessed via Internet Archive But how would someone go about finding these pages? We didn't have Google in the early days. Other search engines like Lycos, Excite and Northern Lights did exist but were nowhere near as efficient as modern search engines. Finding something you were interested in was not as simple as typing a few words and getting to that information in one click. No, the web was much more of an adventure. It was a place that you wandered to discover new areas, like exploring the vast open seas. A new virtual space that lead to all kinds of strange, interesting, exciting places. This is what the web was like, at least, in our collective imagination. Masters and Navigators The web was a different kind of place in those early years, and we had different words to talk about it. In an article titled Cyberspace, the old-fashioned way, authors at the Rhizome project make a very important point: Today's web browsers want to be invisible, merging with the visual environment of the desktop in an effort to convince users to treat \"the cloud\" as just an extension of their hard drive. In the 1990s, browser design took nearly the opposite approach, using iconography associated with travel to convey the feeling of going on a journey. Netscape Navigator, which used a ship's helm as its logo, made a very direct link with the nautical origins of the prefix cyber-, while Internet Explorer’s logo promised to take the user around the whole globe. Old logos of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer Navigation. Exploration. Browsing. Surfing. The web was akin to a virtual manifestation of physical space. We even had a word for it: webspace. In Geocities, this was expressed with the notion of neighborhoods, creatively-named categories like Area51 for sci-fi, Heartland for families and pets, RainForest for the environment, Vienna for classical music, CapeCanaveral for science and mathematics. Neighborhoods avialable on Geocities in 1998, accessed via Internet Archive Another word that was very common back in the Geocities days that has since died out is the word \"webmaster\" (mostly gender-neutral, although sometimes declined to the feminine \"webmistress\"). The idea was that you created a space on the web, of which you were the master. You welcomed visitors (sometimes with a splash screen), guided them around by explaining what the site was about and the different spaces available to them (usually on the home page) and reminded them to leave a word on the guestbook on their way out. But the semantics of the web of yore made sense in the context of how you practically interacted with it. You very rarely just came in for one specific thing and then immediately left like you might today; you usually entered a website and looked around. You browsed. Which takes us back to the original question of how other internautes found your website in the first place. You were lucky if your small site showed up in pre-Google search engines, but even if it did, it would mean that somebody was actively looking for it. But not everybody who visited your website was looking for anything specific. They might simply have wanted to find other websites about a topic they were interested it. One way of doing so was by browsing directories, like the Geocities neighbourhoods: lists of websites often arranged by categories and sub-categories. In fact, most search engines were also directories, or portals as some were called back then. In 1997, Excite was both a search engine and a directory, organised into channels, accessed via Internet Archive One of the biggest ones was the DMOZ open-directory project, based on the original Mozilla directories, whose goal it was to \"produce the most comprehensive directory of the web, by relying on a vast army of volunteer editors\". You can still browse a 2001 archive of the old directory to get a sense of how it worked. About DMOZ page from 2000, accessed via Internet Archive The other way to discover new websites relied on a key feature of the web: hyperlinks. You would go to one website and find your way to many others, much like if you go to my \"Retro Stuff\" page and follow one of the links to something interesting elsewhere on the web. This idea of linking to things elsewhere was particularly common; most websites had a \"links\" page with their own personal collection of interesting webpages. This cross-linking was the main way I personally discovered my favourite websites, which I would then add to my bookmarks to be able to find them again later. In fact, the practice of cross-linking had an intersting cultural element: webrings. An example of a webring (about European History) from Ray's Miscellany Webrings were \"circular\" collections of websites, often around a topic or a theme. The idea was that you could go from one website to another by clicking on the \"next\" or \"previous\" buttons usually placed on the bottom of each member's homepage. These have also largely disappeared. Modern Gatekeepers Today, most of the time spent on the web is either on a small number of very dominant platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, or mediated through them. There is so much \"content\" that is constantly pushed at you as a user that very few of us actually venture out to browse and explore anymore. We simply don't need to. But these platforms thrive on \"user engagement\"—likes, comments, clicks and shares—and their algorithms are more likely to give visibility to content that generates this behavior. Instead of browsing, the web is for many an endless and often overwhelming stream of content and commentary picked out by algorithms based on what they think you already like and will engage with. It's the opposite of exploration. When you're not receiving information passively and instead actually actively looking for something, you most likely have the same singular point of entry as about 87% of all web users: Google. Google has become the de facto gatekeeper of the web, an arbiter of what is useful and what should get visibility. Except, most websites that appear on the first page, the links that you are most likely to click on—less than 1% of searchers click on something in the second page—are designed to be there by optimising for Google's algorithms. One consequence of this is that most of the websites that people get to \"organically\" are created by professionals and marketers who \"position\" themselves on those keywords. This means that the smaller, amateur web gets hidden in the shadows of web professionals who design around specific keywords and audiences. Google's results for \"bartending recipes\" won't take you to the small web Not only is Google largely a monopoly in search— other search engines like Bing, DuckDuckGo and Qwant are still far behind in adoption—it is also the biggest ad selling platform. Last year, it represented \"31,1% of worldwide ad spending, or $103,73 billion\" (source). The power that comes from being in such a position, along with being present in almost all major websites (through their widely-used analytics platform, despite the numerous privacy concerns) means it can actively push its own vision of the web. And this web is quite different from the kind of \"small web\" crafted by webmasters of the 90s and early 2000s. Google's web has a different set of values and vocabulary that come with it: personalisation, insights, engagement, conversion, performance, optimisation. The Commercial Web (of Marketing) There has always been a place for commerce and marketing on the web. Amazon was already selling books online back in 1995, eBay was launched in 1997 and Dell sold over a million dollars worth of equipment by the end of the same year. By the 2000s, despite the dot com bust, online commerce was growing. This development was natural; the web enabled sellers to reach more distant clients without having to rely on phone orders, fax or the postal system. The commercial web co-existed and grew with the personal, amateur one. The open nature of the web meant that all kinds of websites could thrive. But today's web is mostly commercial. The smaller web of individuals has neither the resources nor the will to compete for visibility and audience the way the commercial web does. Companies and marketers understood that the web presented new opportunities to sell more and target users based on their online activity. They started pouring money into digital ad strategies, analysing how people used the web, what they talk about, what they search for and what they click on. Marketing companies convinced brands that you had to be online and produce content to be more relevant because that's where their customers already were. They invented words like \"native advertising\" and \"sponsored content\" (content made to look like a regular articles but are really paid advertising). Companies started pouring money into their digital strategies to understand and alter influence the behavior of internet users to their advantage. Companies like Quantcast offer detailed behavioral/psychographic data on us web users, including our actions across different websites, to marketers to track and influence us. With its content strategy, analytics (the surveillance infrastructure that I spoke about in my previous article) and search engine optimisation, the commercial web brought a completely different set of priorities: to engage their \"audience\", convert them and retain them for as long as possible. For them, the web was just another marketing channel. Compared to the small web, this commercial web is tactical and predatory. It can dynamically generate hundreds of pages around common search queries. It can follow web users across different websites, analyse their interactions, and use that information to target them more precisely. It also has serious resources. Just last year, companies spent over 300 billion euros in online digital advertising, most of this money going to the same platforms and gatekeepers—Google and Facebook—that sell their ability to better target you based on the information you give them. What this means is that web users end up interacting and spending most of their time on the visible, predatory commercial web, while the very long tail of smaller, amateur websites remains hidden in the noise. The Product-oriented Website The design of the modern commercial web is also \"sanitised\": it is polished, follows conventions and is optimised for efficiency. This is one of the reasons so many websites you go to today look and feel the same. The codes of the commercial web have become so dominant that we have forgotten that the small web still exists and has a completely different priorities. Modern web design principles are very rarely directed at regular people looking to make a website on something they are interested in. Instead, the focus is on creating websites that perform well: Don't use too many colours. Write short, catchy headlines. Don't let content be too long. Optimise for SEO. Produce video content, attention span is decreasing. Have a an obvious call to action. Push your newsletter. Keep important information above the fold. Don't make users think. Follow conventions. An SEO person's idea of Universal Web Design Principles That Improve Usability And Conversion Modern websites are designed to direct user behavior towards certain goals: a purchase, a click, a share or a sign-up. The words, the colours, the message are tailored to these goals, much like packaging on products in the super market. A 2008 article called by Smashing Magazine called 10 Principles Of Good Website Design was the top result when I searched for \"good web design\" whilst writing this essay. There are many others, some more recent, but they all pretty much say the same thing. The author of this one even clearly begins by stating that \"[...] user-centric design has established as a standard approach for successful and profit-oriented web design\". But the web is not always \"profit-oriented\" and it certainly does not need to be \"user-centric\" (and I say this as a UX consultant). If it were, there would be very little creativity and self-expression left. The rich diversity of the web would be reduced to the online equivalent of a massive, orderly, clinical shopping mall meant to drive sales. No, the web can just as well be \"author-centered\", hobby-centered or even be dog-centered! It is worth remembering a website does not have to be a product; it can also be art. The web is also a creative and cultural space that need not confine itself to the conventions defined by commercial product design and marketing. The Web as a Creative Space With the dominance of the commercial web and the normalisation of its code and techniques, it is easy for most people to think that the web is a complex machine. Most websites today are built with sophisticated content management systems, SEO and social media strategies, multiple plugins, detailed analytics and audience tracking, optimized for different breakpoints and served via a global CDN. But the web is really a lot simpler than that. You really only need two things: a web host and HTML (and basic CSS for formatting). And you don't need to make it \"user-centered\"; much like the early webmasters on Geocities carving out their own corner of the web, you can express yourself any way you want. It’s the difference between product and art. A painter wouldn’t add more red to her painting or change the composition because market data showed that people liked it better. It’s her creative vision; some people might like it, others might not. But it is her creation, with her own rules. The question of \"performance\" is simply irrelevant. It's the same thing with the small web. If the commercial web is \"industrial\", you could say that the small web is \"artisanal\". One is not better than the other. They serve different needs and both can co-exist in an open web. It would nevertheless be a shame if we only spent time on the commercial web and never got the opportunity to experience the creativity, passion and quirkiness of the small web. To show you what the it can look like and how different it can be from modern websites, I have collected a few examples that I think illustrate the richness of the small web. Highlights: From the Past We will first look at small websites from the past and then move on to ones that are up and running today. To be able to dig up these websites and give you access to them, I am grateful to the wonderful and important archival work done by: Internet Archive, which, thanks to the 439 billion web pages saved since the mid 90s, lets you travel back in time and see how a website looked in the past. Restorativland, a \"restored visual gallery of the archived Geocities sites, sorted by neighborhood\". On to the examples. A Laurel & Hardy Fansite A fan-made site from 1998 about comedy duo Stan Laurel and Oliver Norville Hardy. The author has this to say about the website: On this website you will find: over one hundred pictures, a small collection of sound files, the complete movie list - from the silent eara to the talkies. Ever wondered what they were singing? Go to the lyrics page and read the text. Laurel & Hardy were the stars but they couldn't have done it without the help of others. You can see who they were on the Supporting Cast page. If you go to the siteinfo page, you’ll notice that the “why” of the website is simply “why not!!”. Why not indeed! A screenshot of the home page of A Laurel and Hardy Fansite Visit A Laurel & Hardy Fansite on Restorativland Fractal Explorer A complete website about fractals by Fabio Cesari, (then) a 24 year old student of computer engineering at the University of Bologna, Italy. Includes very clear explanations, image galleries and step-by-step guided tours: Many people have probably been fascinated by the infinite complexity and beauty of fractals. I wrote this brief tutorial to explain, in simple terms, how the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets are generated. This document provides an informal introduction to these subjects, and is only intended to be a starting point to learn more about fractals and fractal geometry. A screenshot of the guided tour of a Mandelbrot set in Fractal Explorer Visit Fractal Explorer on Internet Archive The National Coca-Cola Bottle Clearing House This website is almost certainly a definitive list of every single commemorative Coca-Cola bottle since the 70s. There are some surprising entries. For example, did you know there was an 8oz (~240ml) Dominos Pizza International Expo 1991 edition, or that such an expo existed at all? Or a 10oz (~300ml) English Royal Wedding one in 1982? A screenshot of the homepage of The National Coca Cola Bottle Clearing House Visit The National Coca-Cola Bottle Clearing House on Restorativland NetHistory Before the Internet existed, BITNET was “an early world leader in network communications for the research and education communities, and helped lay the groundwork for the subsequent introduction of the internet, especially outside the US\". (LivingInternet.com). This website is an “informal history of BITNET and the Internet”: If you're looking for a dry, formal history of the Internet, look elsewhere. The purpose of NetHistory is to give you a feeling for what it was like in the pioneering days of BITNET and the Internet. Hopefully, you will gain some perspective and come to understand the early Internet experience (although one could argue that the experience in question is a lot like sitting in front of a mainframe terminal in the middle of the night with a Twinkie-and-Jolt buzz). At worst, you should find it entertaining. NetHistory has extensive archives of early network publications (VM/COM, NetMonth, FSFNet, DargonZine, Nutworks, The Gilding Byte among others) and “personal insights of the people who were there while BITNET and Internet history was being made”. A screenshot of NetHistory's Archive page Visit NetHistory on Internet Archive joan stark's ASCII Art Gallery Think text art is dull? This artist has something to tell you: You might not think so after visiting this website. There is much more to these low bandwidth graphics than smileys and emoticons. ASCII Art has progressed beyond being a simple computer graphics technique and has become a popular art form. You'll be amazed at what can be created by only using ASCII (American Standard Code of Information Interchange) characters. Some of the text graphics at this site are html-colorized, some are JavaScript-animated, others are simply text. All are unique, created by hand, and certainly not the same ol' boring text art that you might be expecting! A screenshot of joan stark's ASCII Art Gallery Visit joan stark's ASCII Art Galleryon Internet Archive Highlights: From the Present As excited as I was to find these wonderful relics, I was even more excited to learn that the small web exists today just as it did back when I was a kid. It's just less visible. Among the projects contributing to keeping the small web alive, three are particularly exciting to me: Wiby.me is a search engine for old-school, interesting and informative webpages, with a useful \"surprise me\" button that takes you to a random result. Neocities.org is a modern web host that lets anyone create a basic website for free and be a part of a community where you can follow other webmasters. Curlie is \"the largest human-edited directory of the Web. It is constructed and maintained by a passionate, global community of volunteer editors\". Ottaviana's Kitchen This website from 1996 is still up today and features a family's Italian recipes passed down from generation to generation: My Grandparents were immigrants from Italy. They came to Ellis Island, in search of the great American dream. This was where my mother was born in Newark, NJ. The recipes were passed to her from her mother, and then passed to me from mine. Since I have no children of my own, what better way to pass on these recipes but on my web page so everyone can enjoy them, and maybe start their own tradition with them. So for now, Buon Appetito. You can read the entire menu and find authentic recipes to sauces, soups, risotti, cookies and dessert, and much much more. A screenshot of a recipe page from Ottaviana's Kitchen Visit Ottaviana's Kitchen Europäische Schmetterlinge This is a German website about European butterflies created in 1998 and maintained until 2005 by Mario Maier. But it isn't just any old website about butterflies; this one is a near-exhaustive collection of almost all butterflies in Europe organised by genus/species, each with a description, an indication of its \"flight time\" and the corresponding caterpillar's plants of choice, along with photos (most taken by the author himself). A screenshot of the page on Melitae didyma butterflies on Europäische Schmetterlinge Some of the pages like this one on Agrodiaetus ainsae seem to have more information than currently available on Wikipedia! I originally found the Geocities version on Restorativland and then found this version that is currently up. Visit Europäische Schmetterlinge It looks like the same author had a larger website for all butterflies on Earth that was up until 2018. You can visit an archived copy of Butterfly Corner. Marseillaise.org Everything you wanted to know about the French national anthem La Marseillaise, from Ian Patterson’s website that’s been up “in one form or another since 1996”. Welcome. No doubt you've come here to see what all the fuss is about on the 14th of July. I think you'll find all you want to know here. La Marseillaise is the national anthem of France, believed by many to be the most stirring of all anthems. Here you will find a transcription of its score, complete sound clips in various formats and a translation into English. A screenshot of Marsaillaise.org Visit Marseillaise.org The Webtender Interested in mixing your own drinks? The Webtender, which has been online since 1995, features over 6000 recipes, a handbook with information on bar glassware, tools, measurements and ingredients, a forum, a wiki and even lets you search for recipes based on what you have in your bar! A screenshot of the home page of Webtender I got the idea to this database when I saw a program called Bartender for the Amiga. I wanted to create a useful web-service, and decided to make something similar for the World Wide Web. Remember that this was just at the same time as the Web (I prefer to call it that) became popular with not only students and people connected to the Internet at work, but also to people at home. So, during spring 1995 I started to collect drink recipes from various Internet sources, including the mentioned program. One of the main sources was The (Un)Official Internet Bartender's Guide and postings to the newsgroup rec.food.drink. Then I decided to let my visitors help building the database. A lot of people make their own drinks, or have their own favourite, so why not let them add it to the database? I created a simple web form that visitors could use to add their drinks. It bacame a success! Today, about 1500 of the drinks have been added by me, and the rest have been contributed by visitors. Visit The Webtender Distant Skies - A Crystalis Fansite A fan-made website about an action-RPG game called Crystalis: 'Crystalis' is an Action-RPG for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in Japan in April of 1990 and in the United States the following July. It was praised by critics at the time for its graphics and gameplay and it inspired a devout, if somewhat small, fan following. In Japan the game was called ゴッド・スレイヤー はるか天空のソナタ or God Slayer: Sonata of the Distant Sky. Built in the visual style of the game itself, the site provides detailed information about the story, characters, game world, spells and items in the game. Even though I don’t know the game, it’s fun to browse around. A screenshot of the home page of Distant Skies Visit Distant Skies - A Crystalis Fansite Your Own Corner of the Web So the small web still exists, and is still giving us all kinds of websites to browse through and discover. As fun as it is to explore what's out there, the best part is really to join in and make your own website. Not on closed platforms or on social media mediated by ad companies, but simply in your own little corner of the web. It's the best way to see how simple and open the web really is. You could easily put up those drawings you've been making, share your thoughts and ideas, or reviews of your favourite whiskies. Make a website to share your writing tips or your best recipes. Or a list of your favourite addresses in your city for travelers who might be visiting. All you would need is to learn basic markup (HTML) and styling (CSS), set up a site on a free host like Neocities.org and start playing. As you can imagine, Neocities is a Geocities-like free web host (minus the ads) whose mission it is to \"make the web fun again by giving you back control of how you express yourself online\". Discovering and joining Neocities was one of the reasons I got so excited about the small web. You can spend hours and hours browsing through the many sites hosted there, or just get a free account to play with. A screenshot of the home page of Neocities If you don't know how to make websites, HTMLDog has excellent tutorials to learn basic HTML and basic CSS. If you prefer video, Khan Academy has an excellent free course for beginners called \"Making Webpages\" that looks very complete. If you have no prior experience, it might take you a while to get a hang of how to change text sizes and colours, add images and link between pages, but I think that’s part of the fun. You could of course always just get a pre-made template or a theme and use that, but it's a different exercise. It’s the difference between buying art and learning how to paint or sculpt. The end result might be the same but the exercise is very different. It might be more practical but is nothing like creating an HTML page from scratch and putting it up on the web for the world to see. Another great thing about the web is that you can always view the source of any public website to take inspiration and learn. Make sure you pick simple, basic ones; the modern web is full of bloated websites that make HTML unreadable. This website, for example, only uses basic HTML and CSS and I invite you to play with the code to your heart’s content. It’s all in the public domain, so you can even copy all of it and modify it (and you don’t have to credit me or even link back, it’s all free). If you do end up making a website after reading this, I’d love to see it (and perhaps even add it on here): send me an email at webmaster@neustadt.fr. Thoughts and Feedback The small web still exists and has a lot to offer. It might not be as polished as the commercial web we're used to, but I hope I have, at the very least, piqued your curiosity and made you want to explore it too.

Photograph: Etienne Laurentevaristo Sa/AFP/Getty Images X Brazilian court orders suspension of Elon Musk’s X after it missed deadline Social media platform to be blocked by ISPs because it did not appoint legal representative in allotted time Tiago Rogero in Rio de Janeiro Fri 30 Aug 2024 19.45 EDT Share The Brazilian supreme court has ordered that X be suspended in the country after the social media platform failed to meet a deadline to appoint a legal representative in the country. Late on Friday afternoon, Justice Alexandre de Moraes – who has been engaged in a dispute with X’s owner, Elon Musk, since April – ordered the “immediate, complete and total suspension of X’s operations” in the country, “until all court orders … are complied with, fines are duly paid, and a new legal representative for the company is appointed in the country”. He gave Brazil’s National Telecommunications Agency 24 hours to enforce the decision. Once notified, the agency must pass the order on to the more than 20,000 broadband internet providers in the country, each of which must block X. In an interview with the TV channel Globonews, the agency’s president, Carlos Manuel Baigorri, said the order had already been passed on to internet providers. “Since we’re talking about more than 20,000 companies, each will have its own implementation time, but … we expect that probably over the weekend all companies will be able to implement the block,” he said. Justice Moraes also initially summoned Apple and Google to “implement technological barriers to prevent the use of the X app by users of the iOS and Android systems” and to block the use of virtual private network (VPN) applications. However, later in the evening, the judge removed the part mentioning Apple and Google “until there is a statement from the parties [X and Musk] in the case, to avoid any potential unnecessary disruptions to third-party companies [Apple and Google]”. The decision imposes a daily fine of R$50,000 (£6,800) on individuals and companies that attempt to continue using X via VPN. The deadline given to X to appoint a new legal representative in the country expired at 8.07pm local time on Thursday (0.07am BST on Friday). An hour later, Elon Musk’s social network announced that it would not comply. Musk responded on Friday by posting on X that Brazil was “shutting down the #1 source of truth” and that its “oppressive regime” was “so afraid of the people learning the truth that they will bankrupt anyone who tries”. The dispute began in April, when Moraes ordered the suspension of dozens of accounts for allegedly spreading disinformation – a request Musk denounced as censorship. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said in a radio interview on Friday morning: “Just because the guy [Musk] has a lot of money, doesn’t mean they can disrespect you … who does he think he is?” X, formerly known as Twitter, has been without a legal representative in Brazil since 17 August, when Musk announced that his company was shutting down its operations in the country “effective immediately” due to what it called “censorship orders” from Moraes. The service has remained available to users in the country. Moraes’ April order to X to block some accounts stemmed from an investigation into “digital militias” who backed former president Jair Bolsonaro’s attempts to stay in power after his 2022 election defeat. After Musk refused to comply, the judge included him in his investigation. On Wednesday, Moraes gave the company 24 hours to appoint a new legal representative in Brazil – a requirement for foreign companies operating in the country – “under penalty of immediate suspension of the social network’s activities”. In the post announcing its non-compliance with the order, X said it “would not comply with his [Moraes’] illegal orders to censor his political opponents”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was also revealed on Thursday that on 18 August – a day after Musk announced the end of X’s operations in Brazil – Moraes blocked the local bank accounts for Musk’s satellite and internet provider Starlink. The aim was to enforce fines imposed on X – as of this Friday, R$18.3m (£2.5m) – for refusing to remove profiles accused of promoting anti-democratic acts and false news. The two firms are part of Musk’s sprawling business empire, which includes the rocket company SpaceX and the electric car company Tesla. The billionaire owns X and 40% of SpaceX and is the chief executive of Tesla. Elon Musk is getting out of control. Here is how to to rein him inRobert Reich Read more Legal experts have criticised the Starlink decision. They argue that it is a different company (albeit one owned by the same person) and should not be held responsible for matters pertaining to X. In an email to its clients, Starlink criticised the decision and stated: “Although this illegal request may affect our ability to receive your monthly payment … we will continue to provide services to you free of charge, if necessary.” Starlink, which is the dominant internet provider in the Amazon, remains operational for now. On Friday, Starlink filed a request with the supreme court to have Moraes’ decision suspended and its bank accounts unfrozen, or, if this request was denied, that the freeze be limited to the total of the fines against X. There is no indication as to when the request will be reviewed. Explore more on these topics X Brazil Elon Musk Social media Digital media Internet Americas news Share Reuse this content",

You can't really do civil disobedience while everyone is looking at you, the way to do that is in secret. reply jauntywundrkind 52 minutes agorootparentprevIt has to be case by case assessment of whether the law is just & right. We have a moral obligation to not follow - to practice civil disobedience - against unjust laws. Banning vpns is a bridge to far for me. The state is placing itself too far above the people, demanding control which it is not entitled to, dictating how we might think & connect. Letting a state grow ever more vicious in its enforcement, letting it cut itself off from the world & punish its citizens by denying them access to the internet & technologies that the rest of the world enjoys is their own real power, is the economic-military control they have, if they want to go to war with businesses. That's all they have for power. And it makes them look dumb, shows them to be bullies, and hurts their people. We need some states to get uppity, so it becomes more clear that the Internet doesn't care & that states can do what they want, ban what they want, and the rest of the world will keep moving along. That's exactly what's happening here, and the state is, in my view, making an absurd fool of itself by going so absurdly far in desperation to try to apply the law.

And the Internet & computing can't have such extreme veto power over how we think & connect. Europe for example has granted itself a right to be forgotten, where even if you do awful awful things you can ask to have yourself removed from the Internet. And so far that's been respected... In European search results. But as much as they insist, we don't censor the rest of the world of those results, just because one group of people says so. Whether vpns are available isn't exactly the same. But its still horseshit. It's still casting a gigantic net because you are a petulant shitty power-mad rule-maker. It doesn't seem representative of the nation either; it seems like some hyper-political over-reacrion horseshit. There's just so many people who will be trying to control how we think, how we connect, control what the internet is. And I feel like there's a long running crisis of what we do and what we don't do to match nations. We maybe aren't at full Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace. But we've had a number of services get to the brink fo bas again and again, only for someone to blink. And it seemed inevitable that this system of never testingimots was going to break, and when it did, rather than break reasonably & part ways, Brazil has just gone scorched earth, has drastically drastically upped the brinkmanship & blast zone, in extremely harmful ways. This is just my judgement call, but fuck yeah I think this shit deserves a colossal colossal colossal middle finger, and if Brazil wants to escalate, well, have fun doing something other than the internet that everyone else uses. You'll have to build that path yourself, and I don't think we should support & enable that schism. reply MyFedora 14 hours agorootparentThe Court of Justice of the European Union clarified that the operator of a search engine is not required to carry out a de-referencing on all versions of its search engine. So, it's a bit bold of you to say that Europe is trying to control the entire internet when they explicitly told Google they're allowed to limit the impact to Europe alone. Also, the \"right to be forgotten\" suggests more rights of the data subject than the text of the article provides for. The title is often understood by data subjects to be an absolute right to have personal data deleted - however if the controller has a legal basis for the processing of personal data, the exercise of Article 17 GDPR has usually no effect. reply cybervaz 14 hours agorootparentprevDude wtf.

It was not like this as far as I can tell, before Lava Jato. Its just that the executive and legislative are now so weakened due to corruption scandals (and open investigations) that no one seemingly dares to move against 1 wild judge. I wonder how this ends though. 1 judge seemingly has more power now than a set of democratically elected senators reply matheusmoreira 5 hours agorootparentIt's been like this since always. \"Doctors think they're gods, judges know\". My legal medicine professor, a coroner, told me that during a class. It got worse in 2019. Some magazine ran a damning article on them. In retaliation, they granted themselves virtually limitless power to investigate, prosecute, judge and punish \"fake news\" of all kinds, with themselves as the victims. They determine what's fake of course. Their powers just kept expanding until they essentially usurped everything. It got to the point this judge started proposing changes to laws directly to our representatives. The changes were rejected but he just rammed the \"fake news\" nonsense down our throats anyway via his \"resolutions\". It's under the umbrella of this \"fake news\" inquisition that the judge-king banned X in Brazil. And not a single politician will move against them. Precisely because they're all so hopelessly corrupt. All the judges need to do to put them in the ground is unearth one of countless corruption scandals. This is not a democracy, it's a dictatorship of the judiciary. Unelected judge-kings with lifetime mandates whose pens directly make the people with guns do their bidding. It's kind of ridiculous to even discuss \"laws\" at this point. These guys could write whatever they want on a piece of paper and it becomes law.

It may be narrated as a fight between corporations and judges, but in addition to all of that, it's ordinary individuals' rights on the line. \"To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker.\" The right of an individual human to read what some individual account on a media platform wrote is a core civil right, and should be inviolate. It stands alone and apart from whatever other wrongs the platform is involved in.

Unfortunately, Twitter got taken over by an international ideologue who likes to pick fights, and you and your neighbor are suffering the consequences of that.

Then the judge orders X to be blocked in Brazil. And he threatens to fine those who try to use X in Brazil through VPNs. In other words, users who easily use X in Brazil to see memes become potential criminals when they did nothing illegal. It's crazy. It's an abuse of authority. Because let's suppose that Carlinho Da Souza calls for burning all the kids alive, the one who commits a crime (let's suppose) is Carlinho, and Justice should be focused on him, not on the company that provides its platform without knowing beforehand that Carlinho is an idiot, and even knowing it later from his posts. And you shouldn't demand that the company prevent Carlinho from exposing his stupidity, that would be like telling the cell phone company not to let me talk on the phone because I threatened to break someone's face. And then, since the company says no, it won't prevent me from talking on the phone, then it blocks the cell phone signal throughout the country, for everyone. Freedom of expression is being able to say what you want and take responsibility for the consequences.

The service has remained available to users in the country.\"\" \"Moraes’ April order to X to block some accounts stemmed from an investigation into “digital militias” who backed former president Jair Bolsonaro’s attempts to stay in power after his 2022 election defeat. After Musk refused to comply, the judge included him in his investigation.\" \"On Wednesday, Moraes gave the company 24 hours to appoint a new legal representative in Brazil – a requirement for foreign companies operating in the country – “under penalty of immediate suspension of the social network’s activities”.\" reply bestatsiege_01 1 hour agorootparentI have recently learned more about this. As I understand it goes something like this. The legal representative of a foreign company in Brazil is expected to be legally responsible for the actions of the company in Brazil. This seems to make sense as Brazil probably thinks having individuals be personally liable for company actions to improves alignment with local laws and gives Brazil more leverage over otherwise exceptionally powerful global organizations. However my understanding of \"Legal Representative\" is the North American understanding. A lawyer who is representing the company and not liable for the companies actions (those would be the directors). I think these articles would do well to add this clarification as threatening to in-prison, and freezing the accounts of a lawyer representing a client in court is wild. Doing the same thing to a person with direct legal liability is a little more sane. I suspect The Guardian and X's accounts are both correct and it comes down to the expectation of the Legal Representative in the Brazilian system. reply robertlagrant 21 hours agorootparentprevI don't really understand the pro-authoritarian stance. reply inglor_cz 21 hours agorootparentPeople hate Musk so much that they would rejoice at the Devil doing him harm. \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend\" is a widespread fallacy.

But if you pack the court (the left is dominates Brazil in the last 40 years) and pay enough to the House (the executive controls the federal budget), you pretty much won the game (you are able to make your own rules). It's amazing how someone from outside like Elon Musk is way, way more powerful than all elected representatives in Brazil, simply because he is somewhat independent from the political apparatus (the most voted congressman in the last election had been arbitrarily banned from social media, so votes really don't count).

I believe twitter or musk himself leaked all court documents when this request came in. Twitter/X closed shop because, after stating that they would not comply with these requests, the judge threatened to jail every Twitter/X employee in brazil in retaliation.

    "originLink": "https://jonathancarter.org/2024/08/29/orphaning-bcachefs-tools-in-debian/",
    "originBody": "Orphaning bcachefs-tools in Debian by jonathan · 29 August 2024 Around a decade ago, I was happy to learn about bcache – a Linux block cache system that implements tiered storage (like a pool of hard disks with SSDs for cache) on Linux. At that stage, ZFS on Linux was nowhere close to where it is today, so any progress on gaining more ZFS features in general Linux systems was very welcome. These days we care a bit less about tiered storage, since any cost benefit in using anything else than nvme tends to quickly evaporate compared to time you eventually lose on it. In 2015, it was announced that bcache would grow into its own filesystem. This was particularly exciting and it caused quite a buzz in the Linux community, because it brought along with it more features that compare with ZFS (and also btrfs), including built-in compression, built-in encryption, check-summing and RAID implementations. Unlike ZFS, it didn’t have a dkms module, so if you wanted to test bcachefs back then, you’d have to pull the entire upstream bcachefs kernel source tree and compile it. Not ideal, but for a promise of a new, shiny, full-featured filesystem, it was worth it. In 2019, it seemed that the time has come for bcachefs to be merged into Linux, so I thought that it’s about time we have the userspace tools (bcachefs-tools) packaged in Debian. Even if the Debian kernel wouldn’t have it yet by the time the bullseye (Debian 11) release happened, it might still have been useful for a future backported kernel or users who roll their own. By total coincidence, the first git snapshot that I got into Debian (version 0.1+git20190829.aa2a42b) was committed exactly 5 years ago today. It was quite easy to package it, since it was written in C and shipped with a makefile that just worked, and it made it past NEW into unstable in 19 January 2020, just as I was about to head off to FOSDEM as the pandemic started, but that’s of course a whole other story. Fast-forwarding towards the end of 2023, version 1.2 shipped with some utilities written in Rust, this caused a little delay, since I wasn’t at all familiar with Rust packaging yet, so I shipped an update that didn’t yet include those utilities, and saw this as an opportunity to learn more about how the Rust eco-system worked and Rust in Debian. So, back in April the Rust dependencies for bcachefs-tools in Debian didn’t at all match the build requirements. I got some help from the Rust team who says that the common practice is to relax the dependencies of Rust software so that it builds in Debian. So errno, which needed the exact version 0.2, was relaxed so that it could build with version 0.4 in Debian, udev 0.7 was relaxed for 0.8 in Debian, memoffset from 0.8.5 to 0.6.5, paste from 1.0.11 to 1.08 and bindgen from 0.69.9 to 0.66. I found this a bit disturbing, but it seems that some Rust people have lots of confidence that if something builds, it will run fine. And at least it did build, and the resulting binaries did work, although I’m personally still not very comfortable or confident about this approach (perhaps that might change as I learn more about Rust). With that in mind, at this point you may wonder how any distribution could sanely package this. The problem is that they can’t. Fedora and other distributions with stable releases take a similar approach to what we’ve done in Debian, while distributions with much more relaxed policies (like Arch) include all the dependencies as they are vendored upstream. As it stands now, bcachefs-tools is impossible to maintain in Debian stable. While my primary concerns when packaging, are for Debian unstable and the next stable release, I also keep in mind people who have to support these packages long after I stopped caring about them (like Freexian who does LTS support for Debian or Canonical who has long-term Ubuntu support, and probably other organisations that I’ve never even heard of yet). And of course, if bcachfs-tools don’t have any usable stable releases, it doesn’t have any LTS releases either, so anyone who needs to support bcachefs-tools long-term has to carry the support burden on their own, and if they bundle it’s dependencies, then those as well. I’ll admit that I don’t have any solution for fixing this. I suppose if I were upstream I might look into the possibility of at least supporting a larger range of recent dependencies (usually easy enough if you don’t hop onto the newest features right away) so that distributions with stable releases only need to concern themselves with providing some minimum recent versions, but even if that could work, the upstream author is 100% against any solution other than vendoring all its dependencies with the utility and insisting that it must only be built using these bundled dependencies. I’ve made 6 uploads for this package so far this year, but still I constantly get complaints that it’s out of date and that it’s ancient. If a piece of software is considered so old that it’s useless by the time it’s been published for two or three months, then there’s no way it can survive even a usual stable release cycle, nevermind any kind of long-term support. With this in mind (not even considering some hostile emails that I recently received from the upstream developer or his public rants on lkml and reddit), I decided to remove bcachefs-tools from Debian completely. Although after discussing this with another DD, I was convinced to orphan it instead, which I have now done. I made an upload to experimental so that it’s still available if someone wants to work on it (without having to go through NEW again), it’s been removed from unstable so that it doesn’t migrate to testing, and the ancient (especially by bcachefs-tools standards) versions that are in stable and oldstable will be removed too, since they are very likely to cause damage with any recent kernel versions that support bcachefs. And so, my adventure with bcachefs-tools comes to an end. I’d advise that if you consider using bcachefs for any kind of production use in the near future, you first consider how supportable it is long-term, and whether there’s really anyone at all that is succeeding in providing stable support for it.",

Just the other day he clashed with Linus Torvalds: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wj1Oo9-g-yuwWuHQZU8v=VAsB... My reading is that he's very passionate, so he wants to \"move fast and break things\" and doesn't get why the others aren't necessarily very happy about it. reply ants_everywhere 4 hours agoparentHey at least it's not the worst behavior we've seen from a Linux file system creator... I thought Carl Thompson's response was very good and constructive: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1816164937.417.1724473375169@ma... What I don't understand is that IIUC Kent has his development git history well broken up into small tight commits. But he seems to be sending the Linux maintainers patches that are much larger than they want. I don't get why he doesn't take the feedback and work with them to send smaller patches. EDIT: The culture at Google (where Kent used to work) was small patches, although that did vary by team. At Google you have fleet-wide control and can roll back changes that looked good in testing but worked out poorly in production. You can't do that across all organizations or people who have installed bcachefs. Carl pointed out that Kent seemed to be missing some social aspects, but I feel like he's also not fully appreciating the technical aspects behind why the process is the way it is. reply koverstreet 4 hours agorootparentHonesty, I think I just presented that pull request badly. I included the rcu_pending and vfs inode rhashtable conversion because I was getting user reports that it fixed issues that were seriously affecting system usability, and because they were algorithmically simple and well tested. Back in the day, on multiple occasions Linus and others were rewriting core mm code in RC kernels; bcachefs is still experimental, so stuff like this should still be somewhat expected. reply pimeys 21 minutes agorootparentThey Kent. I love your work and I have succesfully used bcachefs in my main workstation since 6.7. I also happily donate monthly in patreon, which I do rarely if ever. Hope you don't get too much into trouble with Linus. I do not want to see you or the project get into the wrong side of the old guard... reply ants_everywhere 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah I see where you're coming from. By the way, I only heard of bcachefs yesterday and I watched a great video where you were presenting about it. I'm excited about the file system and it's super cool to hear from you! reply koverstreet 1 hour agorootparentLikewise! reply complaintdept 2 hours agorootparentprev> Hey at least it's not the worst behavior we've seen from a Linux file system creator... I think that dubious distinction would go to Hans Reiser. reply ralferoo 4 hours agoparentprevIt's very clear from that thread that he doesn't understand the purpose of the stable branch. It doesn't mean \"stable\" as in \"the best possible experience\", it means it as in \"this code has been tested for a long period of time with no serious defects found\" so that when the stable branch is promoted to release, everything has undergone a long testing period by a broad user base. If there is a defect found, the change to a stable branch should literally be the minimal code change to fix the reported issue. Ideally, if it's a newly introduced issue (i.e. since being on the stable branch), the problematic code reverted and a different fix to the original defect applied instead (or left if it's deemed less of an issue than taking another speculative fix). Anything that requires a re-organisation of code, by definition, isn't a minimal fix. Maybe it's the correct long-term solution, but that can be done on the unstable branch, but for the stable branch, the best fix is the simplest work around. If there isn't a simple work around, the best fix is to revert everything back to the previous stable version and keep iterating on the unstable branch. The guy even admits it as well with his repeated \"please don't actually use this in production\" style messages - it's hard to give a greater indication than this that the code isn't yet ready for stable. I can understand why from his perspective he wants his changes in the hands of users as soon as possible - it's something he's poured his heart and soul and he strongly believes it will improve his users' experience. It's also the case that he is happy running the very latest and probably has more confidence in it that an older version. The rational choice from his perspective is to always use the latest code. But, discounting the extremely unlikely situation that his code is entirely bug free, that just means he hasn't yet found the next serious bug. If a big code change is rushed out into the stable branch, it just increases the likelihood that any serious bug won't have the time it needs in testing to have the confidence that's the branch is suitable for promotion to release. reply qalmakka 1 hour agorootparent> The guy even admits it as well with his repeated \"please don't actually use this in production\" style messages - it's hard to give a greater indication than this that the code isn't yet ready for stable. True that, and yet the kernel has zero issues keeping Btrfs around even though it's been eating people data since 2010. Kent Overstreet sure is naive at times, but I just can't not sneer at the irony that an experimental filesystem is arguably better than a 15-years old one that's been in the Linux kernel for more than a decade. reply _ph_ 4 hours agorootparentprevIt seems to be a difficult situation: he has bug fixes against the version in the stable kernel for bugs which haven't been reported. I can see both perspectives: on stable you don't want to do development, but also you want all bugfixes you can get. I can also see the point of Linus, who wants just to add bug fixes and to minimize the risk of introducing new bugs. Considering that Kent himself warns against general use right now, I don't quite see the urgency to get the bug fixes out - in my understanding Linus would happily merge them in the next development kernel. And whoever is set to to run bcachefs right now, might also be happy to run a dev kernel. reply ralferoo 3 hours agorootparentI agree. If the author himself is telling people it's not ready for production, it doesn't really matter what bugs this code has, unless it affects other subsystems or is a dangerous regression from the previous stable release. If the bug it's fixing was already in the current release branch, wasn't noticed before and has only shown up now late in the stable branch lifetime, then it definitely doesn't seem like something that needs an urgent fix. reply Arch-TK 3 hours agorootparentprevHe is not submitting changes for stable. He is submitting non-regression fixes after the merge window. It's clear he understands the rules and the reasons for them but feels like his own internal development process is equivalent at reducing the chance of major regressions introduced in such a PR such that he can simply persuade Linus to let things go through anyway. Whether this internal process gives him a pass for getting his non-regression fixes in after the merge window is at the end of the day for Linus to decide. And Linus is finally erring on the side of \"Please just do what everyone else is doing\" rather than \"Okay, fine Kent, just this once\". I would say it's ironic to start a comment saying: \"It's very clear from that thread that he doesn't understand the purpose of the stable branch\" when it's \"very clear\" from your opening paragraph that you don't understand the thread. reply ralferoo 51 minutes agorootparentPerhaps you might enlighten me how it's \"very clear\" from my opening paragraph that I don't understand the thread. Granted, the initial post could be interpreted a number of different says, but having read the whole thread, I think I have a pretty good understanding of the intent. But clearly, you have a different interpretation, so please - enlighten me to your way of thinking. Taken at it's most charitable, the opening of the first message \"no more bug reports related to the disk accounting rewrite, things are looking good over here as far as regressions go\" would suggest a meaning of \"there are no significant bugs, the changes below are optional\". The next section in the change description then says that this fixes a number of very serious bugs. Straight away, I can see the potential for an interpretation difference. Is it \"heads up, no changes required\" or \"these fixes are critical\"? He's told \"no\" by Linus, for reasons that seem to correlate with what I said (unless you'd like to point out in what way I don't understand the thread), and then rather than saying \"yeah, then can wait until the next stable branch\", he doubled down on the importance of getting these changes in and basically saying that the rules should only apply to everyone else and not him because he knows that there won't be any new bugs because of $REASONS. $REASONS that didn't apply when the bugs were introduced. $REASONS that include automated testing, but that didn't find these bugs originally. The thread (which apparently I don't understand) contains a perfect summary from Linus himself: \"But it doesn't even change the issue: you aren't fixing a regression, you are doing new development to fix some old probl;em, and now you are literally editing non-bcachefs files too.\" All this for some changes to a system that he's actively discouraging people from using because it's not production ready anyway, and so none of these bug fixes are actually critical for right now. It's good he ultimately backs down, but he should never have been pushing for these changes this late in the stable branch timeline anyway. So, that's my understanding of the thread. I'd be interested to hear how your understanding of the thread is so radically different from that. reply Arch-TK 19 minutes agorootparent> enlighten me Fundamentally on the whole I don't think most of your interpretation is comment worthy. (To clarify, I don't think its particularly objectionable following from the premise in your opening paragraph.) But... > in the stable branch timeline Again. Like I outlined in my initial reply. This has nothing to do with stable. I don't know why you keep talking about stable. The discussion is about bleeding edge mainline Linux. It's clear to me because: * It is a PR for Linus. I don't know enough about stable to know if they use PRs but most stable stuff I do know about involves marking patches for stable on the specific mailing lists oriented around stable. * Linus doesn't handle stable. * Linus and Kent are taking about the merge window and Kent submitting non-regression fixing patches after it. This doesn't make any sense if it was in a stable context. The process is different. * If this was stable the discussion would be with GKH. So, your comment is based on the premise of this being a discussion surrounding stable. It's not, so I don't know what to make of the rest of your comment on the basis of this incorrect premise. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 3 hours agorootparentprevI thought stable means \"doesn't change\"? reply megous 1 hour agorootparentNot in the kernel land. Stable branches feature tens of thousands of patches. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 1 hour agorootparentPatches are expected but the kernel interfaces shouldn't change right? Like if I write a kernel module no patch should break my compatibility and make my module not build anymore (I think)? I don't care if it changes underneath as long as it doesn't change where I interface. reply megous 55 minutes agorootparentUsually. There are no hard rules though. Upstream stable kernel certainly does not care about compatibility with your particular thirdparty module. You'll just have to add another KERNEL_VERSION #if. Maybe if you're nvidia, or something, things are different. reply rubiquity 3 hours agoparentprevLet’s not misrepresent Kent over a single incident of sending too much after a merge window. He’s extremely helpful and nice in every interaction I’ve ever read. reply qalmakka 1 hour agoparentprevMy 2 cents: these are the types of people that actually get the job done. All good software in my experience starts thanks to overachieving human representations of Pareto's law - people that can do alone in months what a team of average-skilled developers do in years. In this industry it's very, very easy to run in circle, keeping doing stuff over stuff without realising you are in a bikeshedding loop, you're overengineering or simply wasting time. We need people that want to just push forward and assume the responsibility of anything that breaks, otherwise I'm sure that in 30 years we'd all still be using the same stuff we've always used because it's just human nature to stick with what we know works, quirks and all. reply ajb 4 hours agoparentprev> he wants to \"move fast and break things\" That's not how I read that thread. This is just about where the diligence happens, not that it can be avoided; and exactly how small a fix is mergable in the fixes phase of kernel development. I don't see that thread as being particularly angry either. There have been ones where both of them have definitely lost their cool; here they are having a (for them) calm disagreement. Linus is just not going to merge this one until the next development phase, which is fine. There have been arguments involving this developer that do raise questions; I just don't see this as one of them. reply ris 19 minutes agoparentprevGreat and now the top thread on the HN discussion is about that drama only tangentially referenced in the article. reply htpart 3 hours agoparentprevThat's a normal LKML conversation. Nowhere do I see actual bugs pointed out, in fact the only testimony by Carl said that bcachefs has been quite stable so far. This is just about following procedure. There are people who follow procedure and introduce many bugs, and people who don't but write perfect software. The bcachefs author cautiously marks bcachefs as unstable, which is normal for file systems. The only issue here is that the patch touched other areas, but in the kernel development model Linus is free not to pull it. reply jt2190 4 hours agoparentprevIs bcachefs-tools going into the mainline distros or into something that’s meant to be less stable and experimental? Linus makes it sound like there’s a more appropriate place for this work. Edit: Reading through the thread, it seems like there is a claim of rigorous but effectively private testing. Without the ability to audit those results easily it’s causing a lot of worry. reply ralferoo 4 hours agorootparentI don't think Linus is particularly concerned about bcachefs-tools, and whether a particular distributions ships with it or not isn't a concern for the kernel. Presumably though, distributions that don't ship the tools may also want to disable it in the kernel, although I'd imagine they'd leave it alone if it was previously supported. Linus' complaint was about adding feature work into a supposed minor bug fix, especially because (going from Linus' comments) they were essentially refactors of major systems that impacted other areas of the kernel. reply JonChesterfield 6 hours agoprevThis would be a good one for Rust enthusiasts to weigh in on. The issue raised is that some program written in rust insists on a very specific version of various dependencies. If other people change the metadata, it builds and seems to run ok with different versions. (Developer on reddit clarifies that it builds and does the wrong thing, and recommends dropping Debian as a solution). Linux likes to pack a finite set of versions of libraries (ideally just one version at a time) and use that dependency for multiple programs, totally at odds with the vendoring specific versions strategy. I'm not clear what a solution is to this one. In the specific case, sure, drop it from Debian. But this isn't the only program choosing to vendor dependencies instead of use them from the environment. reply rlpb 6 hours agoparentMaintenance is much more practical if everything in your dependency tree uses the same version of every dependency. Achieving this in practice is much of the work distribution maintainers have to do. Doing this has a couple of key advantages: 1. when a security vulnerability needs patching in a stable distribution release, the security team only have to patch one version instead of a dozen or more different versions bundled all over the place 2. a library that depends on dependencies A and B, both of which depend on X, can actually work properly if it needs to pass API objects created by X across between A and B, since X is of the same version In an ecosystem where it's considered acceptable to \"pin\" versions of dependencies and also call any system that doesn't use the pinned versions \"unsupported\", both of the above two cases become impractical. Whether you use shared libraries or static libraries, the above matters still exist. reply orra 5 hours agorootparent> 2. a library that depends on dependencies A and B, both of which depend on X, can actually work properly if it needs to pass API objects created by X across between A and B, since X is of the same version That feels like an advantage for the developer, not the distro maintainer. I find that amusing, because you're saying it's easy if they can use one version of the library. Well, that's also true if they're writing an application, hence pinning. reply rlpb 2 hours agorootparent> That feels like an advantage for the developer, not the distro maintainer. It's an advantage for the ecosystem, yes. Not the developer of the library (X in my example), but a different developer. Someone who is trying to write an app to do something interesting with A and B. > ...because you're saying it's easy if they can use one version of the library. Well, that's also true if they're writing an application I don't think that's true. Perhaps library A has pinned dependencies for X such that it is in conflict with unrelated library B that also uses pinned dependencies for X. Both libraries are now less useful to the ecosystem, because they are now inadvertently incompatible with each other (if their APIs expose X's objects). My example demonstrates why this doesn't work in the general case, and therefore why it's wrong to expect that everyone does it this way. reply rfoo 5 hours agorootparentprevNo. 1. Rust is as hostile to dynamic libraries as glibc to static. 2. With everything static you have to rebuild every dependent on any security patch anyways. If you meant with multiple versions maintainers have to backport patches to multiple versions. Maybe don't backport at all? Some people appreciate having backports. Users of software written in Rust does NOT. So why bother doing backports for them? 3. > a library that depends on dependencies A and B, both of which depend on X, can actually work properly This will be detected during compile (since it's all static! sorry dynamic linking fans) and dealt with. reply jonhohle 3 hours agorootparentDynamic libraries have had interface versions and linking strategies for decades. For statically compiled apps, if the version is over specified recompiling will have no effect. The dependent will have to be updated with a new version string. reply tsimionescu 2 hours agorootparentprev> Some people appreciate having backports. Users of software written in Rust does NOT. So why bother doing backports for them? This is completely false. First and foremost, people who use applications don't care at all what language those apps are written in, and there is no \"community of people who use Rust tools\" that could have a different world-view from everyone else. And beyond that, there is no one in the world who doesn't want backports, because it's never safe to just take the latest version of some piece of software and expect that everything will still work as expected. Having to take even a month of new features just because you need a security fix. And note that Rust even at the language level has strong support for backwards compatibility and support for older versions. It's definitely not true that Rust people, even developers, live at the bleeding edge and don't need backports. reply rlpb 2 hours agorootparentprev> This will be detected during compile (since it's all static! sorry dynamic linking fans) and dealt with. If it is correctly detected, then the only \"dealing with\" that can be done is to fail to build. reply viraptor 6 hours agoparentprevThis isn't Rust specific. The same issue exists in all languages where the versions can be restricted at project level. It's an issue in Debian because they can't handle multiple concurrent versions (beyond renaming the package) and want every package built without internet access. But that same issue affects Ruby, Python, etc. if the project specifies strict versions. And if you deal with filesystems, you really want strict versions - I understand why the author wants to keep it that way. It's more of a self-inflicted Debian policy pain rather than anything to do with Rust. The author could be nice and vendor, but also he's completely right to refuse. The request is basically \"we put handcuffs on ourselves, so please you do the work instead\". reply AshamedCaptain 6 hours agorootparentIn fact, I am tired of the same issue e.g. when evaluating machine learning tools with Python. It's as if everyone just says \"dependency = ${exact_version_I_have}\" and never considers anything else. Not helped by the fact that most of these projects break ABI every other day which I still think it is just plain evil. Please don't say \"just use containers/virtualenvs/vendoring/whatever\" because at some point you obviously want these \"containers\" to use your real hardware. And your GPU driver is only going to be at one version, no matter how many statically linked executables you have. reply ris 24 minutes agorootparent> It's as if everyone just says \"dependency = ${exact_version_I_have}\" and never considers anything else. This is what I call \"version soup\". The idea that every project can choose an near-arbitrary set of very exact version numbers of dependencies and expect it to work. And that every project on earth has the burden of continually stirring their soup, often through a tool like dependabot, hoping (cross fingers) no compatibility problems come about. Of course, there's no guarantee that those versions will work together. The extremely limited abilities packaging tools have for expressing dependency restrictions (>= this or that version) generally lack the ability to even handle the concept of stable branches with backports. i.e. \"No, it must be >= 1.2.3.. what do you mean they backported the relevant fix to 1.1.4? 1.1.4In nixpkgs we attempt to address this situation for the python ecosystem by providing one version of each package (with few exceptions) per release. But in return, we put in work to make sure those versions actually work with each other - generally by getting the projects' test suites integrated into the build system. The idea is that an app built to depend on nixpkgs packages should be able to expect to do dependency upgrades as a \"jump\" every 6 months when there's a new nixpkgs release, but otherwise be able to depend on a stable suite of packages that still receives security updates & backports. Is this different from any other Linux distribution? reply epage 3 hours agorootparentprevIn Rust, it is frowned upon to pin to an exact version. We do encourage people to specify what semver version range will work. We don't have great support for depending on and verifying multiple-major version ranges when a library broke compatibility but not in a way that affects you. reply rfoo 4 hours agorootparentprev> And your GPU driver is only going to be at one version, no matter how many statically linked executables you have. This is a non-issue. libcuda.so (which is part of the NVIDIA driver, their userland part) can not be statically linked into anything, since it's closed-source and no .a shipped at all, so no possibility of misconfigure it to be statically linked. And NVIDIA drivers, as a whole (including a pair of libcuda.so and corresponding .ko), is infinitely backward-compatible, you can always use new driver with old libraries. So the problem you mentioned does not exist at all. Statically linking to cuBLAS / cuDNN etc never add more pain and can only reduce pain. Unless you hold it wrong. reply AshamedCaptain 4 hours agorootparentThat is hardly true for NVIDIA over the years, as I have experienced personally, and it's definitely not true for about every other GPU driver in existence -- particularly AMD's RoCM, which even recommends specific Python versions to go with each ROCM version. In addition, replace \"GPU\" with any other piece of hardware, such as NPU. Or even software, such as your desktop environment. Do you think a statically linked binary will run with Wayland+1 ? It's already a chore to run games that link with older SDL versions, and the only reason you can at all is that SDL was dynamically linked... Even the kernel itself does a pretty poor job at maintaining backwards compatibility (e.g. contents of /sys changing every other year). Statically linking just hardcodes one of these things, and then forgets about the rest, such as IPC APIs, desktop APIs, filesystem structure, etc. which due to the poor culture out there are moving as much as the libraries themselves. reply mananaysiempre 2 hours agorootparent> Do you think a statically linked binary will run with Wayland+1 ? Yes, yes it will. The baseline stuff (the base protocol and xdg_shell) has been stable for years. Of course, one might argue that the caveman byte poking provided there turns a modern machine into a slightly faster 15-year-old one, and I agree it does. (It’s still fun to do as an experiment.) But the moment you try to actually leverage the GPU the modern Linux desktop forces you to abandon static linking in order to load pieces of the graphics driver into your address space, and unfortunately those pieces will in turn force you to dynamically link the distro’s preferred libc (likely Glibc) and libwayland (as opposed to any other protocol implementation). So either you poke pixels into a byte buffer by hand, and your question gets an answer in the affirmative simply because that foundational layer is fairly small, or you take advantage of the hardware, and your question becomes moot because you can no longer statically link. reply aragilar 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's 100% culture: this happens across all languages. reply cogman10 6 hours agorootparentprevIt should be noted that, particularly for rust, it's a silly policy as rust does not support dynamic linking of rust libraries.

It creates a security nightmare. Distributions expect to be able to security patch without waiting for laggard upstreams to bump their pinned dependency versions. If the ecosystem insists that only upstream-sanctioned versions are acceptable, then that runs contrary to this expectation, because it blocks distributions from patching or bumping dependency versions. If this case should be an exception, then you end up with a security team having to patch myriad different versions. That's the security nightmare. reply cogman10 5 hours agorootparentFair point. I do think we need to reevaluate how security is managed in terms of software. It's often the case that we say \"this library version has a CVE, we need to update it!\" However, it's not often the case that the CVE in the library is even exploitable from the parent application. I'm thinking of a recent 9 CVE against zlib... But actually it was a rarely used extension API for working with compressed files. Something like path tracing to see if a vulnerable API is even accessible from the parent application/library before instructing the universe to adopt a new version. reply tsimionescu 0 minutes agorootparentI think it's already complicated to find all the software that uses a library version that has a known vulnerability, because of the many slightly different versions floating around, static linking, software running in docker containers etc. Expecting to further identify which applications use a particular part of a library gets even more difficult, and lazy developers will use this as an excuse not to patch far more often than you'll save on unnecessary updates. miki123211 4 hours agorootparentprevRust has the advantage of aggressively gating many library APIs behind feature flags as a convention. A lot of third-party libraries consist of a core of the most essential functionality that the entire library just can't go without, and everything else, particularly things that require yet more external dependencies to work, is gated behind a feature. You could imagine a model where security vulnerability reports include a combination of features required to trigger that vulnerability. If the vulnerability was in a rarely-used extension, like it was for Zlib, many dependents would be automatically marked as non-vulnerable because they wouldn't have the necessary feature flag active. reply aseipp 3 hours agorootparentprevNot all distributions suffer from this, because they have the tooling to patch all crate versions given a name. Compile times are actually the worst part but can be mitigated. But these distros also fundamentally accept the language's compilation model in question, so they have to develop solutions if they want to supply software to their users rather than make up excuses. Most distros don't like vendoring, for reasons. But many code maintainers do like it, for reasons. So it is what it is. There are also more tools than ever to do things like correlate versions of OSS packages with reported vulnerabilities e.g. Google's osv.dev. 95% or more of Rust vendoring isn't actually \"vendoring\" in the sense you have to figure anything out. The dependencies are literally written in the lock file with the version and that can be traced back to a Git hash automatically in almost all cases. Some crates that bind C libraries might require this work, where you have to look at the code to see \"What version of the code did the `cp -R` into here?\" but they are practically limited in number, and detectable. You aren't doing any detective work for 98% of this stuff. It can be scaled pretty well with a few (good) heuristics. Rust even has the advantage that large, vast amounts of code is actually statically analyzable under known sets of configurations/features. In the future I suspect a tool like `govulncheck` for Rust will be developed, making accurate vuln tracing even easier. While I'm admittedly biased because I work on a distro where this problem isn't as directly relevant, my answer is that in 2024 if you don't have the tooling to do this stuff, it's absolutely on you. Whether as a policy decision or a technical limitation, whatever. reply tsimionescu 2 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean that they can patch all crate versions given a name? Sometimes the same patch might be trivially applied to many different versions of a library, but in the general case, this is not true: the amount of work is in direct proportion with the number of library versions you have to patch, even if you know exactly which versions those are. So the difference between maintaining, say, 3 versions of a library, and 30, is going to be ~10× the work, even with tools that instantly identify the exact versions that need to be patched. reply hamandcheese 5 hours agorootparentprevIf the only way a security team can cope is with a single version policy, that sounds to me like a tooling problem. Take Nixpkgs, for example. They have this concept called \"default crate overrides\" which their rust builder uses, which offers the capability to patch all versions of a crate. That's not to say that Nixpkgs does rust perfectly, but just an example of the sort of tooling a security team should have at their disposal. reply tsimionescu 2 hours agorootparentHow does it patch all versions automatically? If the library has been refactored, you still need to modify the patch for the pre-refactor and the post-refractor versions, for example. The closest you might get is a ChatGPT-based tool, but that is nowhere near safe enough for security patches. reply SSLy 4 hours agorootparentprevThe security team got used to c/c++ being the only way to build native binaries, and would prefer to peg other square languages into this round hole.

To make things worse, some of them were not only old versions of zlib, but also had modified that zlib code, so each had to be reviewed before applying the fix. Debian (and other traditional distributions) learned from that incident, and started a strong push to not only remove vendored copies of libraries, but also when possible use a single version of these libraries. Which means that, whenever an important security issue is once again found in a widely used library, only a single copy has to be fixed and updated. reply chandlerswift 3 hours agorootparentI'm interested in hearing more about the history behind Debian and zlib!

Debian is a great OS, but it targets stability and long term support for its releases. That just isn’t compatible with newer, faster moving software that’s still working towards stability. I remember it being an issue when I was playing around with Mono around 2010 ish, and it’s an issue now with bcachefs - a very new and fast moving technology.

Presumably it will, but once everything is functionally at 1.x even if they don’t reach it officially this will be become a non-issue.

To deal with this today you install a stable base system with an overlaid \"user\" package system so Debian/Fedora + nixpkgs/guix/brew/snap/flatpak/mpr/pip/cargo/etc. Unfortunately because because although you can get most packages on nixpkgs you can't get all and you'll need to install multiple so it becomes a nightmare to maintain (how do you remember all the package managers you have to update during the xz vulnerability?) and extremely bloated due to duplicated dependencies (especially for GUI packages that require gnome or kde). You do get pretty far for CLI-only packages by just adding nixpkgs though. Too bad it's so terrible to use.

Some other comments suggested you need it to mount a degraded file system but it seems to me that is a case where either 1. your system can't boot and you need external recovery boot tools anyway or 2. you can boot and can run whatever tools you want (you can install the latest version of bcachefs-tools via nixpkgs for example).

Not all are. reply crote 4 hours agorootparent\"Vendoring is hostile to distros\" in turn directly leads to \"loose dependencies are hostile to upstream developers\". Distros want to be able to mix & match upstream code with whatever version of the dependency they happen to have lying around in a drawer somewhere. Understandable, as the alternative is having to support dozens of versions of the same library. Upstream developers want to use a single fixed version of their dependencies for each release. Understandable, as the alternative is having to support support a massive test matrix for every possible version of every dependency, just on the odd chance that some obscure distro wants to mix a brand-new libfoo with a 5-year-old libbar. And all of this boils down to \"versioning is actually really hard\", because even with SemVer one's bug is another's feature[0] so there's still no unambiguous way to choose a version number, which in turn means upstream can't choose a version range for their dependencies and be reasonably sure that simply testing with the latest version won't result in breakage with other versions in that range. If dependency management was easy, we would've solved it decades ago. [0]: https://xkcd.com/1172/ reply mrweasel 2 hours agoparentprevShared libraries also mean that you can patch a large number of programs, simply by updating the shared library. If you have a large number of statically linked program, you need to recompile all of them, which means that you need to know exactly which applications uses the affected library, when a bug shows up, and recompile all those applications and redeploy them. Without knowing, I imagine that's also partly why Debian wants to have all programs use dependencies installed via APT, it makes it easier to keep track of which other packages needs to be rebuilt. Personally I'm a huge fan of having applications ship with all their dependencies, like statically compile Go, Rust or Java jar/war/ear files or even containers. It's super easy to deploy, but you do need to be constantly rebuilding and keeping track of dependencies, and I'm not seeing a ton of people doing that. For Python programs we use apt as a package manager for libraries, because that removed the burden of keeping on top of security issues, to some extend.

But with Debian and Fedora people alike it's been like talking to a brick wall. \"No, your concerns don't matter, this is our policy and we're going to do what we want with your code\". They've made it very clear that I have no voice or say in how they package it. So then he breaks the build by switching to the packaged version of bindgen, an old unsupported version. And he makes no attempt to debug, doesn't even send me the build error until months later. As a result, Debian users were stuck on a broken version of -tools that wasn't passing mount options correctly, which meant that when a drive died and they needed to mount in degraded mode, they weren't able to. This happened to multiple people - that bothered to report it. This was quickly fixed upstream, but as far as I know it's still broken in Debian; and Jonathan Carter wasn't fielding any of those bug reports, I was. I'm tired, frustrated and demoralized by this drama and tired of constantly having to respond to it. This has taken up an enormous amount of my time. I really wish this guy hadn't packaged -tools for Debian in the first place. I never asked for it. I have enough on my plate to do without a bunch of distro drama to deal with as well. reply smashed 4 hours agoparent> I would rather something not be packaged at all than packaged badly; this whole experience reads like a lesson in what not to do. You might consider adding a big warning on your official documentation about unsupported distribution packages. Add links to relevant issue tracker/bug reports or mailing list discussions saying until So and so issue are resolved, the official statement is that distribution package is unsupported, not recommended and deemed dangerous to use. This is as much leverage as you can have with the distribution community. Then wait for them to upstream patches and attempt to fix the issues. Accept fixes as you consider appropriate or not. It's also important to at least respect the distribution's opinions in regards to having only one version of a library's major release . Just respect and understanding, you don't have to agree. Also, all the problematic libs cited by the packager are 0.x.x numbered which sounds like a very young and immature ecosystem of dependencies. Of course, this is bound to cause pain to packagers. I think this speaks volumes about the high level of interest for bcachefs, that they actually tried to make it work instead of not bothering. reply mahkoh 4 hours agorootparent0.2 and 0.4 are different \"major releases\" of rust crates as you say. The major release is determined by the first non-0 component in the version number. The issue is that debian appears to only allow one version even if there are multiple major versions. If debian is fine with packaging versions 2.0 and 4.0 but not 0.2 and 0.4, then debian does not understand rust version numbers. reply koverstreet 3 hours agorootparentprevnah, I'm not taking the fight to Jörg Schilling levels :) reply haileys 5 hours agoparentprevThanks for taking the time to comment here! > So then he breaks the build by switching to the packaged version of bindgen, an old unsupported version. Could bcachefs-tools solve this problem upstream of distros by releasing a source tarball with the bindings already generated, so that you can use whatever version of bindgen you want, and bindgen is not needed at all when building from this release tarball? This would be similar in nature to traditional autotools approach where some amount of pre-compilation is done to produce a release tarball from what actually lives in the source repository. It's also what I do for some of my ffi crates. I have a script in the root of the repo which regenerates the bindings, but when published to crates.io, the bindings are already generated and bindgen is not part of the build downstream of my crate. reply koverstreet 5 hours agorootparentI already provide tarballs with vendored dependencies - I did this for Fedora, so that package builds wouldn't have to download anything. I'm not going to special case the bindgen bindings because this really isn't a bindgen specific issue - this could just as easily been any other dependency. reply haileys 5 hours agorootparentSpeaking from practical experience, bindgen is a particularly heavyweight dependency. It requires libclang to be available and also adds a considerable amount of time to the compile. If it makes compiling the software easier - and end users compiling the software themselves would benefit here as well as distro maintainers - then it would seem like a pragmatic move to me. reply koverstreet 5 hours agorootparentThis really isn't about bindgen. Any time a dependency is changed, the package version should be bumped and retested. This is a massive improvement in reproducibility, bisectability and our ability to QA. Before this model, bisecting breakage that was a result of a change in library 'a' breaking something in consumer 'b' was effectively impossible; now it is.

But I do agree with a weakened version where “static libraries” is replaced with “vendored code”, and that’s the (part of) problem TFA describes. (The rest of the problem is that the goals of Debian are incompatible with upstream refusing to support versions of their own code more than a couple of months old. Which they transparently are, so there isn’t much to argue about here.) reply yshui 5 hours agoprevThis is pretty dumb on Debian's part. First of all I don't understand why they insist crate dependencies must be pulled from their repository. They are just source code, not built binary. AFAIK there is no other distro that does this, what they do is that they would download crates from crates.io (`cargo vendor` is a command that does this automatically) and build against that. Arch does this, Gentoo does this, NixOS does this, why does Debian has to be different? Secondly, even if they have to use crates from their repository, I don't understand what's so hard to just have multiple versions of the same crate? That will solve the problem too. This is just all-around weird what Debian is doing. (Full disclosure, I am the one who introduced the first piece of Rust code into bcachefs-tools) reply acka 5 hours agoparentDebian has a Social Contract[1] as well as guidelines {the DFSG}[2] regarding the commitment to only distribute free and open source software that all package maintainers must adhere to. This means that package maintainers must check the licenses of source code and documentation files, clear up any ambiguities by talking to upstream, and (as a last resort) even excise code and/or documentation from Debian's copy of the codebase if it doesn't meet the requirements of the DFSG. In practise, this means that Debian has to make its own copy of the source code available from a Debian-controlled repository, to ensure that no (accidental or otherwise) change to an upstream source archive can cause non-DFSG compliant Debian source or binary packages to be distributed. [1] https://www.debian.org/social_contract [2] https://wiki.debian.org/DebianFreeSoftwareGuidelines reply koverstreet 3 hours agorootparentThat justification doesn't work here - I provide vendored tarballs, so the source code availability argument is moot. reply righthand 3 hours agorootparentBut it’s not guaranteed. The Debian way provides a method of allocating responsibility. So if anything does go wrong they can point to a responsible party, the package maintainer. By providing tarball source you’re trying to placate responsibility of some code. You could build those tarballs on a different machine/different OS and any issues wouldn’t technically be your problem because “it’s just deps”. reply cesarb 4 hours agoparentprev> AFAIK there is no other distro that does this, what they do is that they would download crates from crates.io (`cargo vendor` is a command that does this automatically) and build against that. AFAIK, most traditional distributions do that, not just Debian. They consider it important that software can be rebuilt, even in the far future, with nothing more than a copy of the distribution's binary and source packages. Doing anything which depends on network access during a build of the software is verboten (and AFAIK the automated build hosts block the network to enforce that requirement). Keep also in mind that these distributions are from before our current hyper-connected time; it was common for a computer to be offline most of the time, and only dial up to the Internet when necessary. You can still download full CD or DVD sets containing all of the Debian binaries and source code, and these should be enough to rebuild anything from that distribution, even on an air-gaped computer. > Secondly, even if they have to use crates from their repository, I don't understand what's so hard to just have multiple versions of the same crate? That will solve the problem too. That is often done for C libraries; for instance, Debian stable has both libncurses5 and libncurses6 packages. But it's a lot of work, since for technical reasons, each version has to be an independent package with a separate name, and at least for Debian, each new package has to be reviewed by the small ftpmaster team before being added to the distribution. I don't know whether there's anything Rust-specific that makes this harder (for C libraries, the filenames within the library packages are different, and the -dev packages with the headers conflict with each other so only one can be installed at a time). There's also the issue that having multiple versions means maintaining multiple versions (applying security fixes and so on). reply kijin 3 hours agorootparent> There's also the issue that having multiple versions means maintaining multiple versions (applying security fixes and so on). This is the most important part. Debian LTS maintains packages for 5 years. Canonical takes Debian sources, and offers to maintain their LTS for 10 years. Red Hat also promises 10 years of support. They don't want anything in the core part of their stable branches that they can't promise to maintain for the next 5-10 years, when they have no assurance that upstream will even exist that long.

Note your examples are all bleeding edge / rolling distributions. Debian and the non-bleeding edge distributions go a different route and focus on reproduce-ability and security, among other things. With the \"get from crates.io\" route, if someone compromises/hijacks a crate upstream, you're in trouble, immediately. By requiring vendoring of sources, that requires at least some level of manual actions by maintainers to get that compromised source in to the debian repositories to then be distributed out to the users.

Why does every programming language now have a package manager and all of the infrastructure around package management rather than rely on the OS package manager? As a user I have to deal with apt, ports, pkg, opkg, ipkg, yum, flatpak, snap, docker, cpan, ctan, gems, pip, go modules, cargo, npm, swift packages, etc., etc., which all have different opinions of how and where to package files. On packaged operating systems (Debian, FreeBSD) - you have the system’s package manager to deal with (apt, pkg respectively). I can have an offline snapshot of _all_ packages that can be mirrors from one place. IMHO, every programming language having its own package system is the weird thing. reply MobiusHorizons 3 hours agorootparentIf you are a developer you almost always eventually need some dependencies that don’t ship with the os package manager, and once some of your dependencies are upstream source, you very quickly find that some dependencies of the sources you download rely on features from newer versions of libraries.

It adds an enourmous barrier to sharing and publishing stuff. Imagine that I make a simple OS-agnostic library in some programming language and want to publish it to allow others to use it. Do I need to package for every possible distro? That's a lot of work, and might still not cover everyone. And consider that I might not even use Linux! A programming language will never get successful if that is what it takes to built up a community. Moreover in the case of Rust distos are not even forced to build using crates.io. However the downside is that they have to package every single dependency version required, which due to the simplicity of publishing and updating them have become quite a lot and change much often than they would like. The funny thing is that in the C/C++ world it's common to reimplement functionality due to the difficulty of using some dependencies for them. The result is not really different from vendoring dependencies, except for the reduced testing of those components, and this is completly acceptable to distros compared to vendoring. It makes no sense! reply Palomides 5 hours agoparentprevdebian is substantially older than all of those distros, and you named three that happen to, in my view, been designed specifically in reaction against the debian style of maintenance (creating an harmonious, stable set of packages that's less vulnerable to upstream changes), so it's strange to say that debian is the odd one out keeping a debian-hosted copy of all source used to build packages seems like a very reasonable defensive move to minimize external infrastructure dependencies and is key in the reproducible builds process there's definitely a conflict with the modern style of volatile language-specific package management, and I don't think debian's approach is ideal, but there's a reason so many people use debian as a base system also it seems like the idea of maintaining stable branches of software has fallen out of vogue in general reply wojciii 5 hours agoparentprevPerhaps they want to have builds they can reproduce years later? When libraries are removed you have to update your build. This will not be the case if you use your own infrastructure (crates.io mirror). reply tsimionescu 9 minutes agoparentprevBecause Debian and similar distros have a goal of maintaining all of the software that users are expected to use. And this means they commit to fixing security issues in every single piece of software they distribute. A consequence of this is that they need to fix security issues in every library version that any application they distribute uses, including any statically-linked library. So, if they allow 30 applications to each have their own version of the same library, even Rust crates, and those versions all have a security issue, then the Debian team needs to find or patch themselves 30 different pieces of code. If instead they make sure that all 30 of those applications use the same version of a Rust crate, then they only need to patch one version. Maybe it's not 30 times less work, but it's definitely 10 times work. At the size of the Debian repos, this is an extremely significant difference. Now, it could be that this commitment from Debian is foolish and should be done away with. I certainly don't think my OS vendor should be the one that maintains all the apps I use - I don't even understand the attraction of that. I do want the OS maintainer to handle the packaging of the base system components, and patch those as needed for every supported version and so on - and so I understand this requirement for them. And I would view bcachefs-tools as a base system component, so this requirement seems sane for it. reply cozzyd 3 hours agoparentprevPart of a distros job is to audit all the packages (even if just to a minimal extent), and in many cases patch for various reasons.

See our services for more information. I adore Nerves. I recently joined the core team. And I’ll be doing my best to help people get along with this lovely way to co-mingle hardware and massively concurrent reliable software. Getting started Assuming you have a comfortable Elixir & Erlang installed, preferrably the most recent. Most conveniently through asdf/mise, but I don’t judge. Instructions are lifted from the official docs but I will try to keep it leaner as I assume you are comfortable with Elixir. Install deps for your OS: MacOS + Homebrew shell brew install fwup squashfs coreutils xz pkg-config Linux + Ubuntu/Debian shell sudo apt install build-essential automake autoconf git squashfs-tools ssh-askpass pkg-config curl libmnl-dev Have a Raspberry Pi computer (not the Picos, those are microcontrollers), with SD-card, available. It will assume a Raspberry Pi Zero, ie. using rpi0 for referring to the target system. You can replace that in any command with another supported system: shell # Install the Nerves tooling called nerves_bootstrap mix archive.install hex nerves_bootstrap # Use the Nerves tooling to create a new Elixir + Nerves project mix nerves.new my_thing # it will ask to install deps, you can yes, otherwise: mix deps.get cd my_thing export MIX_TARGET=rpi0 # Getting deps with the target set will fetch the base linux system mix deps.get mix firmware mix burn The mix burn should prompt you for which SD-card you want to flash the firmware to. Then start the device with that SD card in it. Give it power and it should turn on. If you have it connected with a data-cable it should show up via USB networking which is convenient. It should be announcing as nerves.local and have picked out one of your SSH public keys to embed in the firmware by default. Try ssh nerves.local to see if it is up. If not you may have to adapt a bit further and set up WiFi. If you have networking the next update is still a mix firmware to compile but the deploy becomes: shell mix upload nerves.local That’s ridiculous. You can also update specific modules by just pasting them over the ssh connection into IEx which is surprisingly practical. Set up Wi-Fi Top of the generally debunked hierarchy of needs is of course Wi-Fi. You can edit config/target.exs to edit the config for hardware devices. host.exs is for running the project locally on your computer. The networking libraries for Nerves are known as VintageNet and we can configure the VintageNetWiFi technology like this by replacing the default \"wlan0\" entry: elixir config/target.exs {\"wlan0\", %{ type: VintageNetWiFi, vintage_net_wifi: %{ networks: [ %{ key_mgmt: :wpa_psk, ssid: \"my_network_ssid\", psk: \"a_passphrase_or_psk\", } ] }, ipv4: %{method: :dhcp}, } } Re-burn the SD-card and with a little bit of time your Pi should connect to your wireless network. If you have one of the larger Pis and an ethernet cable that also works great. Nerves Livebook If you are a bit lost on what to do and inspiration hasn’t sparked immediately you can instead get some neat tutorials going from Nerves Livebook. There you get pre-baked firmware with special environment variables for setting up Wi-Fi. Note that it starts a bit slowly, especially on something like a Pi Zero. So be patient. Follow the instructions linked because they are friendly and practical. Going further with Phoenix The Nerves documentation has a part about UI where we show how to do a so-called Poncho project (less bad than an umbrella project, but it’s still raining). Redwire Labs published their approach which I know others have also done and dubbed it naked Phoenix. I like this approach so if you want to integrate Phoenix. Try it. All just Elixir * If you’ve dealt with your fair share of Mix projects and Elixir applications Nerves is fairly straightforward because you are just building an Elixir thing. Thing can get a little bit spicier if you need some special dependencies but usually that’s actually fairly simple. Either the library pulls it in for you or you need to install packages via buildroot. It is more involved than you might be used to for apt. Pretty much a slightly old-school Docker image situation. The nuisance is the build time and that’s the flip side of building a tiny dense BEAM-centric linux from scratch instead of shipping Ubuntu and hoping for the best. I can tell you I’ve had more luck reviving a Nerves-project 2 years down the line than I’ve had when I’ve hacked together something on top of Raspberry Pi OS. There are some things that have fancy deps that aren’t possible to cross-compile or aren’t ready for it. But I’ve seen most of Membrane compile without issue. I’ve installed SQL Cipher as an encrypted alternative to SQLite. There’s some nuance there but it is the same that lives in your Dockerfile plus a bit of architectural nuance. You also get some cool stuff you usually don’t poke at on a server. VintageNet for wrangling network interfaces. NervesTime for both Real-Time Clocks, ntpd and so on. The Nerves heart variant of the Erlang heart. A/B firmware partitions and firmware validation. Things that are more fun on-device than on your average server is stuff like connecting a camera and using evision. I’ve added a Coral TPU over USB and had some fun via tflite_elixir. Find some devices to talk to, you now have a little server that can pull down your calendar, parse it and control things based on that, or based on a public RSS feed you like. There are so many possible things. I have hacked on my Elgato Keylights and my Elgato StreamDeck. And you can get incredible mileage out of OTP functionality like GenServers and the binary pattern matching to do things with hardware. You really get to do the stuff Erlang was made for. More Nerves Things to read further on: NervesHub Really fancy firmware updates, including binary delta updates, for Nerves devices. Me, Josh and the Nerves team are making them cooler by the day. Includes nerves_hub_link and nerves_hub_cli. NervesKey Opinionated abstractions on top of hardware encryption using the ATECC608-series from Microchip. This gives your device an identity and I’ve been doing stuff with it. Mobius On-device metrics, I want to look into this one and try to combine it with Explorer in some neat fashion. Scenic Not currently the liveliest project but it does allow you to make UI all in Elixir and is used in production. Sensors & peripherals There are many devices supported to be used directly from Elixir that you can pick up off of Adafruit or Pimoroni and just have fun with. I’ve implemented the Inky eInk display and the VCNL4040 ambient light and proximity sensor. exit That’s it for now. Try Nerves and let me know if you run into things that feel confusing or weird about Nerves and I’m happy to try and clarify, improve and generally help you succeed with Nerves. I am reachable on email lars@underjord.io and on the fedi @lawik. Underjord is a 4 people team doing Elixir consulting and contract work. If you like the writing you should really try the code.

Basically, once you have Linux, you can run nearly anything already. reply lawik 12 hours agorootparentIt was never intended to. The BEAM is not a good fit for that environment. I find it a bit bewildering that people are disappointed about that but I think it comes from having had the difference between microcontroller and embedded linux device clear to me from the early Pi and Arduino days. You can look at AtomVM for a way to run Erlang and Elixir on an MCU. It just isn't Nerves. Nerves is a Linux :) reply MarcusE1W 11 hours agorootparentprevThere is the AtomVM, a (mini)BEAM for microcontrollers https://www.atomvm.net/ There is also integration for Elixir and AtomVM. reply vendiddy 46 minutes agorootparentI'm curious if AtomVM is compatible with Erlang nodes.

Joining a new company, especially a big one, is always the same struggle -- the soup of acronyms and weird proper nouns. Everybody knows that $colorname is a UI library and $malename is an authentication server and three letter acronym refers to a specific department, maybe in a different company.

As they do everywhere. Competitive job market all around right now. Taking the question at face value, I don't know your intent, and not as a bitter commentary on the experience of trying to find a job with tech one likes: I know people that did embedded C++ that got recruited into doing Elixir on a Nerves project. I know lots of people who have just switched their web work in Ruby or Python to Elixir. Either by finding the job or doing the work for getting the tech adoption OK:ed at current employer. Most Elixir devs I know did not have prior Erlang experience. But most did have prior dev experience. The BEAM ecosystems solve problems you mostly encounter with some experience. I have also seen and onboarded several junior folks into the ecosystem and jobs as their first professional thing. Connecting and collaborating with people who could vouch for you when the opportunity comes is a good starting point. But there are many paths. (edit: fix a spelling) reply cultofmetatron 7 hours agoparentprevJust hired a elixir dev recently. Assuming you already have experience developing in another platform, learn elixir and My advice would be to be active on the elixir slack and to have a few projects.

All of them are based on Raspberry PI Zero kits from Pimoroni (shop.pimoroni.com) and sadly some of them are not in stock, and won’t be stocked again according to their support. I built: - a clock with an internal task scheduler (e.g. send me an email digest every morning), based on https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-bot-pi-zero-w-proj... - a lamp that follows the solar cycle for the given location (e.g. it turns purple at twilight), based on https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/mood-light-pi-zero-w-proj... I’ve also got some impression (https://shop.pimoroni.com/search?q=impression&stock=true) kits that I want to program for a family photo tree kinda thing. A summary of my experience: - these are not complex projects, and required (in the worst case scenario) some porting of the original python examples provided by pimoroni to interface with the hardware. - deploying via ssh is fast and reliable - can quickly experiment by pasting a new version of a module in the device shell. Got an editor keybinding to do that by targeting a tmux pane. - OTP constructs help structuring code beyond the standard infinite loop that you have in other languages. And you can have pub-sub and state machines just with the standard library. - it’s easy to abstract the hardware bits away using dependency injection, so that you can work on the host machine if needed. - working with time and time zones is possible thanks to the ecosystem packages. - any dependency with native extension can be a problem if not built with cross compilation in mind, and if it crashes on device that’s where debugging becomes a bit harder (might need a serial cable). - if needed, I usually add a simple web yo for config/customization. - there are great tools in the ecosystem to troubleshoot memory issues etc. - sometimes I have WiFi issues and I suspect it’s related to power management, but I haven’t checked thoroughly yet. reply lawik 11 hours agoparentprevI (author) have been dealing with the ReTerminal DM from Seeed Studio which in spite of being industrial is a fairly fun device: https://elixirforum.com/t/bringing-up-cool-hardware-with-ner...

Decades ago I worked as a test engineer for a big hardware vendor. We had maybe a couple hundred raid controllers that we were testing and to address some issues we found, the supplier needed us to change a bunch of configuration variables that were only accessible via a text menu system over a serial connection to these devices. After painful manual reconfiguration of a handful of these things, I instead wrote a fairly complex expect script to make the appropriate changes and also validate all the settings on the rest of the raid controllers in a fraction of the time it would have taken to do it manually. It saved me so much hassle and got me some pretty good kudos and respect from my direct leads. It's one of those tools that I kind of wish I would need to use again! reply i_am_a_peasant 10 hours agoparentthis is the sort of context I've also seen expect use. hardware test automation in manufacturing xD reply shrubble 17 hours agoprevOne of the early papers by Don Libes, author of Expect, explaining how to use it; published 1990 - thus predating Linux: https://www.nist.gov/publications/using-expect-automate-syst... reply hiAndrewQuinn 12 hours agoprevMy go-to example for `expect` is password-based SSH.

People are I find less scared of \"useful CLI tool I can script around\" than \"scripting language in its own right\". reply quesera 11 hours agoparentprevFor this particular use case, I'd suggest sshpass instead. https://linux.die.net/man/1/sshpass ... Operations folks today might not understand -- everything just works nowadays, which is slightly boring. And boring is good! But there's something unique about the feeling of making things work even though they are not designed to work, and really have no right to work. Expect has been a lifesaver for some of the most critical systems at some of the biggest companies in the world. No aspersions cast by me! reply hiAndrewQuinn 11 hours agorootparentDefinitely, `sshpass` is the more better keyhole tool for this job. I picked it as the most common example I can imagine everyone going \"ugh, I have to do this by hand again?\" at. reply oxygen_crisis 9 hours agorootparentsshpass is a travesty of security. It has all the pitfalls of putting your front door key under your doormat. Except you're doing it in a world where everyone can materialize a unique key out of thin air, and you can always instantly tell your door which of those keys should or shouldn't be allowed to open it. sshpass is a curse, even calling it a crutch would be improper flattery. It's a dangerous cheat that accomplishes nothing except impeding people from otherwise spending the 20 minutes it takes to figure out SSH keys. reply quesera 5 hours agorootparentYes this is the proper dogma, but you're missing the point. Any automation around passwords is a crutch and a mistake. But sometimes it is necessary. You don't always control the remote systems. The remote systems are not always capable of key-based auth. And sometimes the remote system is not of high concern so the \"danger\" is null. sshpass makes a reasonable effort to do the best-possible thing under these less-than-ideal circumstances. The other options suck more. My most recent use of sshpass is to collect reports from a vendor over sftp. I would have preferred to use https with BASIC auth, but in truth that has exactly the same problems as sshpass, and I have other hills to die on. reply yusyusyus 8 hours agorootparentprevsometimes the device you're connecting to doesnt support ssh keys. reply actinium226 7 hours agoparentprevFor the case of entering passwords, you can just use ssh authentication instead reply ndsipa_pomu 6 hours agorootparentThere's certain devices (e.g. firewalls) that don't allow you to save your public key for SSH authentication, so you're stuck with passwords.

Agreed. In that old system we did not have any TCL scripts or third-party libraries--just C, Perl, and C shell (no Bash; it was Unix). C shell scripting is painful (https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Csh.html), so practically all scripting was Perl or occasionally AWK. reply overanalytcl 17 hours agoparentprevArguably, Tcl can do GUIs much easily and can integrate C less awkwardly than Perl. Both have their use cases, at any rate, and more people should use Tcl, Perl and any version of Expect.

Maybe it is specific to my environment, but I get mangled commands about 1% of time, which really sucks for automated workflows. I mostly countered this by writing commands to a tmp file, verifying md5sum and then executing the file on the device side. reply nrclark 3 hours agorootparentAcross a large enough sample set, I definitely see occasional serial errors (although they're rare). For me, I detect them by checking the exit-code on each command that I run, and also by looking for expected output in response to the commands.

Expect would still be useful for someone scripting a debugger (for example), but Tcl falls under the close to isoteric language nowadays and it takes less time to just repeat the commands in a readline capable interactive program than find just the right way to script it. Last time I've tried to use expect was when I attempted to build a Tk frontend to the Haskell GHCi debugger (similar to the DDD application), but I got tripped up, from vague memory, on terminal ansi codes, and random lock ups I couldn't pinpoint. reply orev 5 hours agorootparentSome tools like ssh and gpg go out of their way to prevent easy use via command line flags.

If the device you are logging into supports sudo then it probably supports bash or python too. In that case a better solution is to create a script on the target device and then call that script over ssh, using key-based authentication. You do not need expect. Expect is mainly used on devices with a rigid terminal UI that do not support scripting and require interactive password authentication. reply anotherpaulg 16 hours agoprevI just used python pexpect [0] for a fun project.

    "originBody": "Ugh. Drew’s blogging about Rust again. – You I promise to be nice. Two years ago, seeing the Rust-for-Linux project starting to get the ball rolling, I wrote “Does Rust belong in the Linux kernel?”, penning a conclusion consistent with Betteridge’s law of headlines. Two years on we have a lot of experience to draw on to see how Rust-for-Linux is actually playing out, and I’d like to renew my thoughts with some hindsight – and more compassion. If you’re one of the Rust-for-Linux participants burned out or burning out on this project, I want to help. Burnout sucks – I’ve been there. The people working on Rust-for-Linux are incredibly smart, talented, and passionate developers who have their eyes set on a goal and are tirelessly working towards it – and, as time has shown, with a great deal of patience. Though I’ve developed a mostly-well-earned reputation for being a fierce critic of Rust, I do believe it has its place and I have a lot of respect for the work these folks are doing. These developers are ambitious and motivated to make an impact, and Linux is undoubtedly the highest-impact software in the world, and in theory Linux is enthusiastically ready to accept motivated innovators into its fold to facilitate that impact. At least in theory. In practice, the Linux community is the wild wild west, and sweeping changes are infamously difficult to achieve consensus on, and this is by far the broadest sweeping change ever proposed for the project. Every subsystem is a private fiefdom, subject to the whims of each one of Linux’s 1,700+ maintainers, almost all of whom have a dog in this race. It’s herding cats: introducing Rust effectively is one part coding work and ninety-nine parts political work – and it’s a lot of coding work. Every subsystem has its own unique culture and its own strongly held beliefs and values. The consequences of these factors is that Rust-for-Linux has become a burnout machine. My heart goes out to the developers who have been burned in this project. It’s not fair. Free software is about putting in the work, it’s a classical do-ocracy… until it isn’t, and people get hurt. In spite of my critiques of the project, I recognize the talent and humanity of everyone involved, and wouldn’t have wished these outcomes on them. I also have sympathy for many of the established Linux developers who didn’t exactly want this on their plate… but that’s neither here nor there for the purpose of this post, and any of those developers and their fiefdoms who went out of their way to make life difficult for the Rust developers above and beyond what was needed to ensure technical excellence are accountable for these shitty outcomes.1 So where do we go now? Well, let me begin by re-iterating something from my last article on the subject: “I wish [Rust-for-Linux] the best of luck and hope to see them succeed”. Their path is theirs to choose, and though I might advise a moment to rest before diving headfirst into this political maelstrom once again, I support you in your endeavours if this is what you choose to do. Not my business. That said, allow me to humbly propose a different path for your consideration. Here’s the pitch: a motivated group of talented Rust OS developers could build a Linux-compatible kernel, from scratch, very quickly, with no need to engage in LKML politics. You would be astonished by how quickly you can make meaningful gains in this kind of environment; I think if the amount of effort being put into Rust-for-Linux were applied to a new Linux-compatible OS we could have something production ready for some use-cases within a few years. Novel OS design is hard: projects like Redox are working on this, but it will take along time to bear fruit and research operating systems often have to go back to the drawing board and make major revisions over and over again before something useful and robust emerges. This is important work – and near to my heart – but it’s not for everyone. However, making an OS which is based on a proven design like Linux is much easier and can be done very quickly. I worked on my own novel OS design for a couple of years and it’s still stuck in design hell and badly in need of being rethought; on the other hand I wrote a passable Unix clone alone in less than 30 days. Rust is a great fit for a large monolithic kernel design like Linux. Imagine having the opportunity to implement something like the dcache from scratch in Rust, without engaging with the politics – that’s something a small group of people, perhaps as few as one, could make substantial inroads on in a short period of time taking full advantage of what Rust has on offer. Working towards compatibility with an existing design can leverage a much larger talent pool than the very difficult problem of novel OS design, a lot of people can manage with a copy of the ISA manual and a missive to implement a single syscall in a Linux-compatible fashion over the weekend. A small and motivated group of contributors could take on the work of, say, building out io_uring compatibility and start finding wins fast – it’s a lot easier than designing io_uring from scratch. I might even jump in and build out a driver or two for fun myself, that sounds like a good opportunity for me to learn Rust properly with a fun project with a well-defined scope. Attracting labor shouldn’t be too difficult with this project in mind, either. If there was the Rust OS project, with a well-defined scope and design (i.e. aiming for Linux ABI compatibility), I’m sure there’s a lot of people who’d jump in to stake a claim on some piece of the puzzle and put it together, and the folks working on Rust-for-Linux have the benefit of a great deal of experience with the Linux kernel to apply to oversight on the broader design approach. Having a clear, well-proven goal in mind can also help to attract the same people who want to make an impact in a way that a speculative research project might not. Freeing yourselves of the LKML political battles would probably be a big win for the ambitions of bringing Rust into kernel space. Such an effort would also be a great way to mentor a new generation of kernel hackers who are comfortable with Rust in kernel space and ready to deploy their skillset to the research projects that will build a next-generation OS like Redox. The labor pool of serious OS developers badly needs a project like this to make that happen. So my suggestion for the Rust-for-Linux project is: you’re burned out and that’s awful, I feel for you. It might be fun and rewarding to spend your recovery busting out a small prototype Unix kernel and start fleshing out bits and pieces of the Linux ABI with your friends. I can tell you from my own experience doing something very much like this that it was a very rewarding burnout recovery project for me. And who knows where it could go? Once again wishing you the best and hoping for your success, wherever the path ahead leads. What about drivers? Yes, I saw that video, and yes, I expect much better from you in the future, Ted. That was some hostile, toxic bullshit. ↩︎",

The linux project uses static analysis tools which provide some of what rust guarantees (outside of unsafe). The language isn't the problem, it's the architecture. In Linux, all of the drivers run with the rest of the kernel. A bad driver can take down the whole thing, or perform arbitrary badness. In Drew's own Helios microkernel, the architecture is right, and it's ready to have folks start piling on drivers in user-space. Those drivers can be written in pretty much any low level language that can produce ELF binaries. It's surely a better path forward to slap a Linux syscall API on top of Helios + some new drivers than to clone the whole linux system architecture in another programming language. At least then, we would have gained something tangible (drivers can't ruin the kernel). Instead of having another Linux written in a different language, with all the same design flaws. reply pizlonator 16 hours agoparent> I don't see why it's so important to rewrite parts of the kernel in rust, or why Drew is so sympathetic to the cause. The linux project uses static analysis tools which provide some of what rust guarantees (outside of unsafe). It’s important because static analysis tools get nowhere near the coverage of a memory safe language. Static analysis can find bugs but it cannot prove their absence. A memory safe type system proves absence. Rust’s type system proves absence module uses of unsafe, which is still much better than what any C static analysis could do. (I am saying this as a Rust hater who’s trying to obviate the need for it.) > The language isn't the problem, it's the architecture. In Linux, all of the drivers run with the rest of the kernel. A bad driver can take down the whole thing, or perform arbitrary badness. This is a case of “why not both”. Sure, you can harden an OS by compartmentalizing. And you can also harden using memory safety. As time goes on, folks will do both. The fact that you could (and should) do one of these things is not an argument to not do the other. reply elihu 6 hours agoparentprev> I don't see why it's so important to rewrite parts of the kernel in rust, It'd be nice to be able to say, \"We're pretty sure these source code files don't contain any null pointer dereferences, array out-of-bounds errors, use-after-free errors, double frees, or (if the kernel rust project fully embraces the Rust way of doing concurrency, I'm not familiar with the technical details) race conditions, because otherwise it wouldn't have compiled.\" When absolutely necessary, unsafe code blocks can provide a back door around some of these checks, but as long as the unsafe code blocks are relatively small, it's a much smaller surface area for these kinds of bugs to show up. Not to mention the type system is in some ways much more user friendly. Proper algebraic types are easier than trying to cobble something ad-hoc together with tagged unions. > or why Drew is so sympathetic to the cause.

He isn’t. The original article gave the project a thumbs down and so does this one… only this time he is here to admit defeat on behalf of the project because of “burnout”. All the praise is just nerdstroking to soften the kernel of the argument that they are working on the wrong thing. reply drewdevault 11 hours agorootparentI am sympathetic to the cause. I respect the Linux project as a whole forming a consensus on the right direction for the kernel and I respect the right of the Rust developers to participate in the consensus-making process and advocate for what they believe is the right direction -- and put in the work to get there. I can hold this view and disagree with their opinion at the same time. I celebrate the difficult technical and political work they're doing to advance their cause, and I respect the hell out of that -- the fact that I would make different choices doesn't contradict this in any way. The fact of the matter is that politics was always going to be difficult, and for all of the respect and admiration I have for the Rust-for-Linux team -- which I do have, thank you -- I am equally sympathetic to the kernel hackers who didn't ask for this project on their doorstep, and for their own needs to be accommodated. I condemn the toxicity that has bubbled up in this process, from C hackers and Rust hackers alike, but even absent that toxicity I think that the political challenges of Rust-for-Linux are enormous and distract from the fundamental work of the project. People have burnt out and quit the project, and you cannot erase their experience when it questions the viability of the project. I'm offering them compassion and a different path that might celebrate their work without leading to burnout. People having burnt out and quitting the project is a historical fact, and not my fault, even if I'm the easy polemic for you to pin the blame on. I think it'd be a fucking shame if they quit pursing their passions for OS development in Rust over it and I've said as much and that's more than I can say for you and everyone else filling my messages with personal attacks and bad faith reading of everything I have to say. reply phaylon 8 hours agorootparentThis just gives all the power to abusers.

Linux is successful because of its timing and probably accidental social engineering - regularly breaking out-of-tree drivers incentivized upstreaming hardware support.

Not does he seem supportive of Rust enough as to replace the top maintainers he trusts and has worked with for a very long time with those that will extend the red carpet for Rust developers.

Now, we are in a situation that is not pleasant for anybody involved. reply nequo 15 hours agorootparentThe problem is that neither Linus nor the other prominent maintainers will live forever. C was the right choice in 1991 but today the landscape is different enough that its shortcomings, for the younger generations, are painful to ignore. So saying yes to Rust, or to some other language that is not filled with foot guns and could also work in the kernel space, is not only a matter of kindness but a matter of long-term strategy for the kernel. reply snvzz 9 hours agorootparent>The problem is that neither Linus nor the other prominent maintainers will live forever. I agree. But likewise, Linux's design is far from the state of the art. Maybe there's value in letting it be what it always has been. It is not realistic to try to migrate millions of LoCs written with poor structure, to properly structured Rust, with barely any support from the pre-existing developers. At some time, it makes sense to move on to something better. This hypothetical system be written in a different language. It could be Rust, it could be C23, or something else entirely. But what it will definitely be is better structured. It would have clean, versioned APIs. And drivers will no doubt run in user space. reply MBCook 15 hours agorootparentprevPrefer C? Or haven’t used Rust? All the Rust kernel developers have to know C. Is that true of the bigger maintainers who are arguing against it? It’s fine to prefer one over the other.

I can think of a couple, including Xorg and GCC. I don't know if those cases can be characterized as \"grudges\" exactly but, in each instance, someone was unsatisfied with the prevailing conditions, forked the work, and then subsumed the legacy. Doubtless there have been far more failures than successes. I also know that computing probabilities based on such ratios is simple minded: other factors exist and the equation is non-linear. > But I think Linux isn't at that position yet. I was disturbed by the irrational behavior I saw in this talk[1]. What the presenter sought was reasonable: communicate the intended semantics so Rust kernel developers can track the evolution. This was somehow understood as: forego C and become a Rust programmer, take responsibility for our work and maintain it going forward. No, I do not believe the former implies the latter. There are endless silos, both formal and informal, for both good reasons and bad reasons, permeating all intellectual work, whether \"open\" or not. It is entirely reasonable to imagine that this pattern can be employed among reasonable people for the matter at hand, especially for something like file systems, where even parallel implementations can and do exist simultaneously. If this behavior is prevalent enough then drastic steps are justified. Whether they're feasible or not is another matter, and also a many factored, non-linear calculation. One could, for instance, reimplement only some fraction of the kernel and be entirely sufficient for most of the backend cloud server Linux use case. Given the enthusiasm for Rust among major cloud operators, I suspect this might be attempted at some point.

That's how I understand it as well: the proposal is 1. Put our Rust code in. 2. If you make C-code changes that break Rust-code, then your change can't be merged until you either learn Rust or wait on us to fix things. This is an unreasonable expectation, IMO, for any large project written in any language; this is not specific to Linux and C and Rust. Making unreasonable proposals in civil language does not magically turn that proposal into a reasonable one. Pressing forward in spite of feedback that the proposal is unreasonable is uncivil, even if you spread a thin veneer of civility over it. reply topspin 8 hours agorootparentI'll stipulate your view of the proposal. Does an uncivil, almost hysterical reaction that is perceived (wrongly or otherwise) as elitist and irrationally hostile an effective approach? I question the basis of the reaction and find it wanting. Paraphrasing now; \"50 filesystems won't be instantaneously converted to Rust.\" Has anyone, anywhere suggested such a thing? I don't think anyone credible has done so. A strawman argument. The accusation of some forced conversion to a new \"religion\" is also baseless, not to mention insulting. An aside: the get_or_create_inode method example that was left on the display for nearly half the presentation is very compelling to me. It is explicit and comprehensive: one can trivially comprehend both the likely implementation of the method and the obligations of the caller without reading a line of code beyond that declaration. Practically self documenting and vastly superior to conventional systems programming C. At one point a speaker likened this to Java, I suppose because of the type composition. That's ignorant and false: that signature conveys so much more value than what one sees in typical Java code that it's not in the same ballpark at all. The verbosity has actual value. Rust is great; a legitimate advance in systems languages. People are compelled by it. That has produced some conflict. Not all conflict is avoidable or inherently evil. The C side of this conflict will need better tactics if they're not going to just devolve into irrationality with false claims, baseless accusations and hysteria. reply lelanthran 6 hours agorootparent> The C side of this conflict will need better tactics if they're not going to just devolve into irrationality with false claims, baseless accusations and hysteria. The \"C side\" don't need any tactics; it's their project and they are free to refuse entry of some other group of people. They can make false claims, they can make baseless accusations and they can throw hysterics all they want to, because they don't have to convince anyone of anything. The Rust side has to provide an argument more compelling than \"you are using inferior tools\", because even if true, it's irrelevant!

The BSDs, Solaris/Illumos, and Windows all have tried, some more than once even. I think there have been at least 4 Linux kernel ABI compatibility layers for those OSes. They've all failed. And all future attempts will fail too for the same reason: The Linux kernel ABI is not specified anywhere, and it's insanely large (and growing). Besides the system calls (easy), many ioctls (hmmm), proc(4) (oof), and many ioctl-like ABIs within ABIs, there's loads of driver-specific ABIs and things like security modules and what not that add their own ABIs and which you'll invariably end up having to support. The last effort in Illumos land foundered on proc(4), IIRC. To top it all off that undefined (but stable) ABI is a moving target: it's always evolving / getting extended. The only thing you have to help you is that whatever the ABI, Linux [mostly] commits to maintaining backwards compatibility with it. If your compatibility ever gets good enough, that will help you, but in the meantime you'll be chasing a never ending and ever growing ill-defined ABI.

A Linux kernel clone is the epitome of a large Rust community project (for many reasons, some noble, some not so noble). It would likely pull in hundreds if not thousands of developers in an arms race assuming the end goal is well defined. Nobody claims it's a small task, but I believe it can probably be accomplished.

It probably wasn't 99% wandering around. So you're going to need something like 10% of the man-hours that went into Linux. You say Rust is more productive? How much more? Maybe a factor of two?

It's a very polite, high-effort, superficially humble piece of writing, that nevertheless boils down to \"You guys should probably leave us alone and work on stuff we don't need to worry about\". Now, working on a Linux fork as a \"proof of value\" thing could be interesting, but it also means that this hypothetical Linust project would be stuck forever chasing Linux's API decisions without any power to influence them (and, if recent history is any indication, quite a lot of hostility from OG Linux maintainers). I can't help but notice that Drew's plan doesn't include any exit strategy, any point where the projects merge or Linux starts taking components from Linust or something. Maybe Drew thinks that forever being stuck between shadowing a concurrent project's API and trying to convince its billion users to switch to yours instead is an attractive prospect. If I was a Rust-on-Linux developer, I'd find that patronizing. reply troad 10 hours agoparentThis is all predicated on the assumption that forks and clones are a bad thing, when they're actually a good thing? Why does a clone require an 'exit strategy'? Does Linux have an exit strategy for merging back into Unix? When is Unix getting merged back into Multics, for that matter? If Rustnux is safer and more performant in the ways that Rust advocates believe it will be, Rustnux will gain traction and demonstrate the potential benefits of Rust in the kernel itself. This is intrinsically beneficial, and I'm unsure how convincing a billion people to switch has anything to do with it. (Also, bizarre metric, does every purcharser-of-an-IoT-thermostat get their choice of OS kernels?) For those who don't want to work on \"shadowing\" an API (quick, someone tell the Wine crowd they're 'stuck' and should stop), Redox already exists. He's not saying to shut it down.

Your 'very practical desire' to write Rust drivers doesn't extend into some sort of corresponding obligation for anyone else to accept that code into their projects. Your desires do not take priority over the desires and needs of others. I feel like people have some kind of misconception about what OSS requires on this point. The only meaningful right you have with the Linux kernel, that you don't have with - say - NT, is the right to fork it. Nothing about the idea of OSS extends you a right to merge whatever code you want into someone else's project to satisfy your 'very practical desires'.

So I'm not sure we've reached the point where a fork makes sense yet. If we forked every time a kernel dev acted nasty to others, we'd have far too many forks. > or 'I hate Drew', which is an irrelevant and cruel thing to say about an actual human being.

Doing anything on Linux is many times as hard as doing it on systems that put a strong emphasis on structure. This is true not just for microkernel, multiserver systems, but for other unices/unix-like such as the BSDs (which put far more emphasis on structure relative to Linux) as well. Thus, I agree entirely with Drew, with extra reasons, that we (developers in general, not specific to rust) should try and put some effort elsewhere than Linux. It doesn't have to be Linux. It isn't the end-all in operating systems. It's just what happens to be most popular -right now-. reply lelanthran 13 hours agorootparent> It doesn't have to be Linux. It isn't the end-all in operating systems. It's just what happens to be most popular -right now-. That's part of the problem, I think: The Rust group's primary goal appears to be increasing the usage and/or popularity of Rust, not merely hardening the Linux kernel. After all, both the kernel devs as well as the Rust group knows very well that the Rust group can maintain out-of-tree patches indefinitely. By using a out-of-tree patch, they can slowly and effectively replace almost all of the drivers. Many people actually would download and use their `rustix` kernel. But that doesn't allow them to achieve their goal of spreading the movement, hence their resistance to prove the concept out-of-tree and the pushback from kernel devs who see this purely as a popularity-booster. There is no good argument against the Rust group proceeding with an out-of-tree development effort; all the ones around \"it's too much work\" reflects the fear that the kernel devs have that the Rust group would push Rush code into the kernel, and then not be around to maintain it when some C code breaks it. reply cryptonector 14 hours agorootparentprevLack of internal APIs is not the problem if the putative Rust-based clone doesn't aim to be compatible with Linux drivers written in C, which I think it wouldn't. The real problem is that the Linux kernel ABis to user-land are merely stable, myriad, and poorly documented. Keeping up is not possible. The BSDs, Solaris/Illumos, and Windows all had at least one (sometimes two) attempts at being compatible with Linux kernel user-land ABIs, and all failed due to being woefully incomplete in spite of being huge. reply PoignardAzur 13 hours agorootparentprev> \"Fine I'll do it myself\" is a story basically as old as time. Heavy survivorship bias in your list of examples, though. reply raggi 19 hours agoprevThere's an attempt at heading off the driver commentary with a note at the bottom. The note makes some hand-wavy thing which is essentially \"assuming you have an army of people with specifications, this won't be a problem\", but that assumption is crazy. Fuchsia is a real OS effort funded by Google (at varying levels of funding through it's lifecycle, which is still ongoing AIUI) - I worked on Fuchsia for a number of years, from approximately the time the kernel had become usable, through to launching on nest hubs where it replaced the existing OS from bootloader to GUI. Drivers remain a huge problem for Fuchsia despite funding. SOC vendors don't provide docs or assistance, even for serious efforts, they demand money first - they're literally holding the software world hostage with this activity. After leaving Fuchsia and reflecting on the whole thing, I really believe that despite the many problems Linux may have over the long term, the only viable strategies for a broadly and practically usable safer OSS system are either: someone donates at least $2bn to get it done in a PBC well managed and focused over a decade, or you slowly mutate Linux into that thing. Anything drastically different is, for now, dependent on the world being a different shape / people & companies having different attitudes than they do. I'd love to see something like Redox prove me wrong, but real world experience suggests that's extremely unlikely. RISCv is the one thing in flight that might \"change the shape of the world\" enough to alter this, but RISCv comes with it's own stack of long challenges to overcome to meet the originally stated goal of broadly and practically usable. Writing a core kernel and usable userspace isn't something to be trivialized, but by cost and work volume, getting a broad set of drivers is far far more effort by an astronomical margin. The OSDev community has thousands of OSes to explore, and barely any drivers that do things a user actually cares about. reply andrewchambers 19 hours agoparentIf its compatible with linux then the linux drivers would work right? reply raggi 19 hours agorootparentIn short: no. Longer: there is no such thing as \"compatible with linux drivers\", linux has a stable(ish, very ish) userspace, but it does not have a stable HAL or driver interface. All of the drivers in Linux are GPLv2, so there are constraints to \"borrowing code\" from them, if you'd even be able to or want to. On the \"ish\" about userspace, while the POSIX layer is pretty stable, the deeper you go beyond that, extended ioctls for devices and drivers, some stuff on netlink, etc are not nearly as stable as the \"never break userspace\" mantra would imply too. Running a subset of userspace software is pretty easy (https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/components/v2/starn..., https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/linuxemu/) but getting much further is extremely hard, and probably practically untenable as Linux is a moving target, even in userspace. reply snvzz 3 hours agorootparentIn such a scenario, it makes sense to design a sane, stable driver api and move drivers to it.

If recompiling is OK, I suggest starting with one of the BSDs, at least they have a fork() that works. reply drewdevault 11 hours agorootparentprevCygwin is a POSIX implementation, not a Linux implementation. Linux is mostly POSIX compatible and so Cygwin is source-compatible, but not binary-compatible, with many programs that work on Linux. reply troad 1 day agoprevTLDR: In response to the recent resignation of Rust-for-Linux's Wedson Almeida Filho [0] and consequent debate over the politics of Rust in the kernel, Drew DeVault suggests that the Rust for Linux crowd build their own ABI-compatible Linux clone, reasoning that a clone is easier than a greenfield research OS (like the existing Redux). It's not a bad idea, imho. Rust folks love rewriting things, and are often quite good at it. It would keep both the curmudgeonly kernel Never-Rusters and the Rust evangelism brigades happy (by keeping them apart). And it's a great proving ground for Rust's claims - assuming licence compatibility, successful rewrites of individual components could be lifted by Linux down the line.

This reminds me of a post, on this site, I saw which said something to the effect of \"ZFS is only great because it is the only filesystem in its domain\" which is ridiculous on it's face, but I think even more ridiculous as you dig a little deeper.

Sometimes you want to scream to that fool who manages to continue to avoid using the safety: \"What more do you want?\" > This is particularly true in supervisor mode, with hardware other than the CPU itself within reach. Of course, I'd agree to some extent, but I think your framing is again perhaps overly narrow. Rust is a really good tool.

And it's going to be a nightmare, because Linux famously makes changes every now and again which require maintainers monkeying all over code they do not know well to change references to functions and structures. This is hard enough with just C, it is untenable with Rust. Let's be honest. Linux isn't even that good. Is it worth the pain?

Well -- never let it be said I wouldn't say it directly to you, and I hope after reading this you will at least understand why I feel the way I do. I said what I said above, because I find your writing deeply incurious, and what is probably worse, directed towards others who are similar incurious, in much the same way say Fox News or MSNBC is in my country. When I read your writing, I never have the sense you've ever thought critically about your opinions at all. There also seems to be only good things and bad things in your cosmology. I hope you know this isn't to denigrate you as an engineer, or you as a person. You may be a wonderful person, and you have certainly built artifacts which are useful to your users. You do also seem to be very principled and sincere in your beliefs. And it's certainly not to say I always live up to my/these aspirations! On the other hand, I think, when a software engineer expounds more broadly on software (which seems to be your only beat), they owe their readers a duty to be self-critical. For instance, as you, yourself, note: You're known for your Rust hot takes[0]. If you (or the comment readers) want me to get more particular see \"Does Rust belong in the Linux kernel?\"[1]. There you skip talking about memory safety to spend more than a few graphs on the \"Trendiness\" of Rust. An argument AFAIK that was never made by those seeking to integrate Rust into the Linux kernel. And this is where I usually get off the Devault train, because it is another shallow strawman based on vibes. Not once do you ask, as someone who is intellectually curious might: \"Maybe Rust is trendy because it provides lots of interesting and useful features. Perhaps I/Drew should try this new language, then I'd have some basis for the many graphs I wrote about 'Trendiness'.\" Unfortunately for the reader, that never happens. Each blog post is one string of unschooled, untested assumptions tied inexorably to another string of assumptions, on and on, ad infinitum. I'll admit I've compared you to Tucker Carlson more than once because that is exactly what reading a Drew Devault blog post feels like, because yours is actually a deeply conservative breed of tech demagoguery, saying to your readers, again and again: \"We already know what's right. Someone just needs to say it now and then...\" Similarly, re: your latest article[0], yes, you do, in a footnote, express that you thought Ted T'so's behavior was bad. But your solutions have nothing to do with remedying the bad behavior. Your solution is -- I was right all along, it was never going to work out, this couple needs a divorce. At every turn I keep expecting you to say: \"Was I right? I think so because...\" but, as a regular reader, I should know better. We are on the Epistemic Closure Express. Drew's writing only knows one destination. TBC this beef doesn't just extend to your writing on Rust. Your writing on Linux packaging was what first bothered me[2]. Never once do you ask yourself questions like: Is there something wrong with the Linux model of 12 different package managers? What if a dev wants users to actually use his or her software, what should they do instead of wait? Do I really imagine distro maintainers are scouring the land looking for new software to land in their distros? Is there a software solution, perhaps a declarative language/system, which would make this easier? Your answer here is like your answer to bad behavior within Linux -- your problem isn't a problem. Because I can't tell my reader Linux has any problems? Because that would be too grey for my black/white world? [0]: https://drewdevault.com/2024/08/30/2024-08-30-Rust-in-Linux-...

Haha, maybe. > More like an activist than ... well ... a normal well-adjusted person. What then am I an activist for exactly? Rust for Linux and better package managers? If you think \"activism\" is my aim after reading my comment, I think you missed my point. The point is -- I can't stand Drew's writing. And the reason why is not because he expresses strong opinions which I don't share, it's because -- Drew doesn't ever consider the possibility he's wrong. Even as a nodding feint to the reader that acknowledges intellectual humility is something we all expect. So, I will accept, in that limited space, I'm an activist. I am an activist for Drew writing better. Do you really need another example of Drew's lack of intellectual curiosity? Well... One might read Drew's \"Rust is not a good C replacement\"[0], and think wait a minute, Drew does actually collect some evidence there that Rust is adopting more features per year than C, Go or even C++. Yes, I'll admit Drew occasionally collects the worst evidence to make bad points. Drew concludes: \"[This prevalence of features] speaks volumes to the stability of these languages, but more importantly it speaks to their complexity. Over time it rapidly becomes difficult for one to keep an up-to-date mental map of Rust and how to solve your problems idiomatically.\" And this conclusion might be a reasonable inference to draw after one has worked with Rust over a year or so, and one can provide some examples of certain redundant or complex behavior, but Drew doesn't do that. He takes some information, which could be relevant, provides it out of any context, and simply moves on. I'd note there is still no evidence Drew has ever even tried Rust in any of Drew's writing. He just doesn't like it from afar! Or perhaps Drew could have provided an example of a feature that wasn't a good feature from the year of this blog entry (2019)? No, that might have required him to wrestle with his point a little, and that would be hard! As Drew says, \"My approach wasn’t very scientific, but I’m sure the point comes across\", failing to understand his superficial approach is exactly the problem with his writing, and this point. His bullets in support are similarly facile. As Drew says: \"C has a spec. No spec means there’s nothing keeping rustc honest. Any behavior it exhibits could change tomorrow.\" Left unremarked upon by Drew is how much of C's spec leaves C's behavior undefined, compared to the implementation defined behavior Rust, because that wouldn't serve to celebrate C and flog Rust. So we don't get the ordinary hemming and hawing one often sees in good writing (\"It could be like this, but I think it's more like this...\"). Instead, we get black and white. Heroes and villains.

First, we may have to choose between those things because Rust in the Linux kernel is not gaining traction and major contributors are dropping out rather than seeing it through. It's valid to speculate about alternatives. Second, software development is not a zero-sum game and such a rewrite can exist in concert with Rust-for-Linux (and even benefit from it). Drew is not handing out orders here anyway. > Second, this would perpetuate toxic LKML behavior. I'd suggest maybe this bad behavior should be dealt with. You've used the passive voice here, and the probable reason for that is that there is nobody who is or will ever be responsible for dealing with LKML's shitty \"culture.\" It's a cesspool at every level and will continue to be so until everyone currently in a leadership position is gone. In addition, the problem here is not technical. Rust is a solution to some technical problems, but technical decisions in a mature group effort are secondary to what Filho referred to as \"nontechnical nonsense.\" That nonsense is the single most important aspect of the project, and too many of the Rust-for-Linux proponents don't seem to understand that. Without developer buy-in, none of your advanced futuristic solutions are even going to make it in the door. The fact that many of the developers whose buy-in you need are assholes is not grounds to reject the work. It simply makes the work less pleasant. Linux moves forward because the people who build it are moving in the same direction. If you want that direction to change, you have to convince a majority of the actors. You're not going to do that by telling them the tools they've used for decades are bad and wrong and the answer is this other shit you happen to be good at. People keep making this assumption that Rust-for-Linux is hindered by technology considerations, but that was never the case. It is and always has been a sales pitch, and the Rust-for-Linux people have completely fumbled the ball at almost every stage. There is a great example in Filho's linked video where he's showing get_or_create_inode and the C devs (poorly and abrasively) try to explain that this design means to implement special cases you have to go fucking around in the type system instead of just branching differently in the call site where the other logic is. Filho gets frustrated because he can't seem to understand that using types this way is not intuitive for many people, and the C people get frustrated because Filho's answers don't account for their objections at all. There's another great example in this very thread where you declare that \"the Rust devs showed an better/easier way.\" They, arguably, did not, if you're not a Rust dev. To someone who isn't accustomed to idiomatic Rust, it seems completely insane to have to go digging around in the type system in order to enable magic elsewhere in the call stack, when you can just tell the computer what to do. Nobody at any point is trying to demonstrate why the Rust approach is superior -- a position I happen to agree with, for the record -- and instead just bemoan these stupid C toddlers who don't take the same things for granted that Rust adults do. It's pointlessly demeaning, combative, and in this case self-defeating, and it's the primary reason I think projects which use Rust ab initio succeed more than these piecemeal approaches. reply mustache_kimono 19 hours agorootparentWe mostly agree. I come to a slightly different conclusion. That more than a sales pitch someone needs to lead this project. GKH could decide to build something in Rust for instance. Re: whether Drew's proposed solution is a reasonable alternative to Rust for Linux, I don't think the technical/practical reasons for wanting Rust for Linux have gone away. We use Linux. We want memory safety. We will be waiting a long time if we are waiting for a new kernel to appear. > To someone who isn't accustomed to idiomatic Rust, it seems completely insane to have to go digging around in the type system in order to enable magic elsewhere in the call stack, when you can just tell the computer what to do. I think this would be a fairer point if the interface was a well documented C interface, which demonstrated how to use the interface correctly but it wasn't. See the API docs: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.0/filesystems/api-summary... And the function itself: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/d5d547aa7b51467b15d9c...

They’re trying to improve a bad api by adding types do describe it’s awkward behavior. The C programmers who love the Linux style want to be able to change semantics or api without modifying rust code. The solution is straight forward, build an adapter later in C that has well describable and clean semantics. Since it is C and in the kernel and has clear semantics the C programmers can maintain it without having to look at Rust. Perhaps the general lack of encapsulation and layers in the kernel will defeat them as they will need a lot of adapter layers.

They remove a lot of ambiguity in how something should be held. Is this data type or method thread safe? Well I don’t need to go look up the docs only to find it’s not mentioned anywhere but in some community discussion. The compiler tells me. Reviewing code? I don’t need to verify every use of a pointer is safe because the code tells me itself at that exact local point. This isn’t unique to the Linux kernel. This is every codebase that doesn’t use a memory safe language. With memory safe languages you can focus so much more on the implementation of your business logic than making sure all your codebases invariants are in your head at a given time. reply GolDDranks 2 hours agoparentIt's not _just_ memory safety. In my experience, Rust is also liberating in the sense of mutation safety. With memory safe languages such as Java or Python or JavaScript, I must paranoidly clone stuff when passing stuff to various functions whose behaviour I don't intimately know of, and that is a source of constant stress for me. reply miki123211 1 hour agorootparentAlso newtype wrappers. If you have code that deals e.g. with pounds and kilograms, Dollars and Euros, screen coordinates and window coordinates, plain text and HTML and so on, those values are usually encapsulated in safe wrapper structs instead of being passed as raw ints or floats. This prevents you from accidentally passing the wrong kind of value into a function, and potentially blowing up your $125 million spacecraft[1]. I also find that such wrappers also make the code far more readable, as there's no confusion exactly what kind of value is expected. [1] https://www.simscale.com/blog/nasa-mars-climate-orbiter-metr... reply db48x 1 hour agorootparentAs much as I like Rust, I don’t think that it would have solved the Mars Climate Orbiter problem. That was caused by one party writing numbers out into a CSV file in one unit, and a different party reading the CSV file but assuming that the numbers were in a different unit. Both parties could have been using Rust, and using types to encode physical units, and the problem could still have happened. reply tialaramex 52 minutes agorootparentYeah, even an extremely powerful units type system like C++ mp-units doesn't fix \"I assumed this number was feet and you assumed it was millimetres\". But both the mp-units and this lighter weight Rust approach would at least make you write that down in the software. There's some chance the mistake is realised, whereas when it's just an organisational assumption that just doesn't happen. reply pessimizer 54 minutes agorootparentprevUnless the unit was part of the type, and why wouldn't it be? A unit error is a type error. You don't have to say that something is 5 long, you can say that it's 5 inches long. And the function can be made only to accept a length in inches, and you can implement :Into on your length type for an automagic conversion. reply kwhitefoot 1 hour agorootparentprev> prevents you from accidentally passing the wrong kind of value into a function, You can do this in other languages such as Pascal with subtypes and something functionally equivalent in C# and other object oriented languages. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 1 hour agorootparentI do not think the claim was that this is a unique construct to Rust. reply the__alchemist 1 hour agorootparentprevIMO, this is one of the most underrated advantages of Rust over most (all I've used) alternatives. Mutation is explicit/principle-of-least-surprise. reply layer8 2 hours agoparentprev> This is every codebase that doesn’t use a memory safe language. Many of the same problems — the mentioned underdocumented API assumptions — exist in memory-safe languages like Java and C#. Memory safety is just one among many aspects in interface contracts, and is actually often one of the better documented ones in non-memory-safe languages. Type-based checking is of course very beneficial, but TFA specifically focuses on the documentation aspect, not on the enforcement, which are in principle orthogonal to each other. TFA draws attention to the fact that the enforcement here also entails better self-documentation. However, it’s limited to whatever aspects the type system enforces. reply misiek08 1 hour agorootparentFor project like this one - it would be cumbersome, but proper Java is also solving the problem. Currently we write code without all throws definitions, because those are handled by Spring-like monsters or other libraries, but having method definied with LockedEx, NullPointerEx etc. is even more friendly as doc generation. Funny, but I don’t like Java that much, but it’s one of those languages also solving documentation problems here. Yes I know it’s \"faster-development\" to have type instead of additional definition attributes, but I think the problem would be also solved. reply dagmx 2 hours agorootparentprevThe posted link talks about how the types act as documentation, and in turn enforce it. I’d recommend reading the whole thread that someone else posted below. reply layer8 1 hour agorootparentI was criticizing your incorrect inference “memory-safe language => better-enforced API contract”. The only thing memory-safe languages do in that context is to remove a single aspect from the universe of things that can be ambiguous in an API, and they also don’t cause anything else to be enforced. (Rust does more, but that’s because of properties beyond mere memory-safety.) In other words, “memory-safe language” doesn’t mean what you want it to mean. reply dagmx 1 hour agorootparentJeez, there’s a whole comment above that explaining the context and caveating it with the needs of robust type system too. If you’re pedantically holding on to one sentence as a gotcha, because I didn’t caveat everything, then fine. But seems a bit much to then say I’m forcing a definition just because you ignore the rest. reply brigadier132 1 hour agoparentprevThe way I like to think of it is as follows: There is a space of all possible programs that can be written. Every time you add a restriction like the borrow checker, more expressive data types, or immutability, you are shrinking the space of all possible programs you can write. Sure, some of those programs are correct but 99.9999% repeating are incorrect. reply tialaramex 1 hour agorootparentRight, we can and in some domains we absolutely should, prefer languages which are specialised to only be able to express programs which match some simple model of what we intended. You cannot invent a wholly new idea this way, but you often don't want new ideas. WUFFS is an example of this, the WUFFS JPEG decoder decodes JPEGs, duh, but even if you deliberately sabotaged it, your sabotaged decoder just... decodes JPEGs wrong, maybe now they all decode to the Goatse image. It not only can't escape to execute arbitrary code, it can't do much of anything outside of the task we intended, all the resulting runtime bugs (for which you need unit tests) are things like oops the grass is blue, or the decoder rejects this 1x1 image even though it's valid. No \"Segfault\" no \"Ooh it truncated the file instead of reading it\", those aren't things we want, so no need to be able to express them. For example I think a lot of big data work could use such a language. Data goes in, processing happens, data comes out. No \"Oops, it wiped the hard disk on nodes 6, 18 and 24, I wonder why\". No weird interactions with the OS that weren't catered for, just data in, processing, data out, which is what the people using these things always want. reply helltone 2 hours agoparentprevI didn't know rust was able to tell when a method is thread safe. Where can I read more about that/try it out? reply dagmx 2 hours agorootparentIt’s probably more correct if I say that data types themselves are thread safe or not. https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/send-and-sync.html So therefore a function can’t do things that invalidate that type level contract. reply remexre 2 hours agorootparentprevSend and Sync are the keywords to search for. reply metaltyphoon 2 hours agorootparentprevIsn’t anything with Arc thread safe? reply ninkendo 1 hour agorootparentNo. Just because something’s behind an Arc doesn’t mean two threads can hold it at once. Arc just ensures that it is freed (dropped) when no threads are using it any more. T itself has to be Send+Sync for Arc to be. To a first approximation, Arc> is what you want when you want a blob of mutable stuff to just work between threads, but you still have to worry about terrible performance if you hold the mutexes too long, etc. (Not to mention mutexes are just slower in general than having types which are natively Send+Sync.) reply ab5tract 2 hours agorootparentprevTelling when a thing is thread safe is hardly the same as telling when something isn’t. reply aaomidi 2 hours agorootparentprevRace conditions within rust are technically impossible :) reply jrpelkonen 2 hours agorootparentSafe Rust prevents data races, but not race conditions in general. reply CryZe 1 hour agorootparentThough arguably, the fact that in order to mutate data from multiple threads, the compiler,forces you to use some synchronization primitive, results in you having to think about how you are going to synchronize access, which should lower the chance of race condition bugs overall. reply tialaramex 1 hour agorootparentprevThe analogy I find helpful for this is, you let the cat out your front door and close it. You walk to the back door and close that too. A race condition (which safe Rust can have) is a normal phenemenon in our world. If we put the cat out the front door, then walk to the kitchen and close that door by the time we reached the back door maybe the cat had run around the outside of the building and come inside again, closing the doors in the wrong order introduced the opportunity for a race - be very careful. A data race (which safe Rust does not have) is a weird thing caused by the mismatch between how you think the computer works and how it actually works. What happens if Alice tries the put the cat out the front door at the same time Bob tries to put it out the back door? Well, in the real world that cannot happen, either Alice has the cat or Bob does. But for many languages† this sort of nonsense can happen and when it does that's a disaster † In safe Rust it can't happen, in Java, OCaml and Go it can happen, but it may not be a disaster (the details are different for each, it is a bug though). reply sixfiveotwo 1 hour agorootparentprevHmmm, no. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31912781/why-doesnt-the-... reply chungy 2 hours agoprevThere are tons of underdocumented Rust libraries, where I've had to pore over it for very long periods of time because the author probably thought the code would speak for itself and not bother writing any documentation strings on any of the functions. No, Rust doesn't solve the problem of incomplete API docs. Developers being diligent enough to document the APIs solves the problems, and that solution is entirely language-independent. reply conradludgate 2 hours agoparentI feel you misunderstood the thread if that's your take away. The argument is that properly utilising a stronger type system is more self-documenting. And quite often to achieve safe abstractions, you have to lean into this paradigm more. It of course still requires discipline, but in my experience it works well in practice. Since C has no generics/type templates, you cannot achieve the same level of type based abstractions, thus you cannot rely on the types semantics alone to suggest it's own use. reply stefan_ 1 hour agorootparentMore self-documenting for whom, the code generating documentation? Because for using it as a programmer I've found the code that has been Rust-ified to normalize everything into 1000 traits of which the given type you are using might implement 100 you can't see without going into more documentation to be a nightmare. reply estebank 1 hour agorootparentI've seen crates like that: APIs with very complex trait bounds that require one to sit down with a cup of tea to pour over before you can understand what they do. I don't particularly like those. What APIs written that way enable is that you're forced to use them correctly, you have a bunch of type ceremony that you need to follow before the compiler will accept a simple method call. That means that the API is resistant to misuse. What you are asking for, reasonably, is for the opposite situation: give me enough information that if I'm accidentally misusing the API, which will be rejected, I will be able to understand what's missing so that I can use it correctly. I'm personally of the opinion that crate author should provide explanations, examples, and take into account the kind of compiler errors people will get when they inevitably try to misuse the APIs. reply Ygg2 1 hour agorootparentprevJust use basic types? Sure you can over engineer Rust, for dubious gains. But that's true for any language. *cough* MetaAbstractFactoryProxyFactoryFacadeBuilderProxySingletonWebViewFactory *cough* > More self-documenting for whom Anyone using basic Rust types. Is type `Sync`? It's safe to share between threads. Is type `Option` its value can be missing i.e. None. Is type moved? Yes, if it isn't borrowed, and not Copy. reply Blahah 1 hour agoparentprev\"pour over\" -> \"pore over\" btw reply chungy 1 hour agorootparentThanks, I didn't know this. I suppose it's like writing \"could of\" instead of \"could've\" :) reply devnull3 2 hours agoprevIn the beginning, I was trying to use Rust like C (which I think lot of people do) and was struggling with the borrow checker. I had a light bulb in my head one day to read the function signature and see if its '&self' or '&mut self'. If any one API of a struct/enum has '&mut self' then its instance cannot be shared across threads without using a mutex (which brings its own friend along i.e Arc). This led me to structure the code in my mind much in advance to prevent borrow checker issues. Another use of this is while embedding an object in a struct. When I realized that '&mut self' infects everything up the call chain it was a big learning moment. That is the embedding struct also needs a mutable borrow as well. reply grimgrin 2 hours agoprevIDK if this is bad practice but I've rolled up the messages if you wanna read this in one view: https://gist.github.com/shmup/d6290988c876c303663d56563bc570... reply faitswulff 2 hours agoparentYou can also click the eye icon in the top right to auto expand all the comments in the thread. reply KTibow 2 hours agorootparentIt's a weird icon choice, I would've used something like `expand-all` reply coder_san 2 hours agoparentprevThank you.

For this I have to bring up that there are indeed rust API's that I have to Google around a bit because I have no way of knowing just by looking at the function signature how to create the type that it expects. Because some types you can't just make from scratch and have to use a combination of other functions to create. reply pornel 1 hour agoparentIt's still an improvement, because you can find what makes that MysteryObject and you know how to pass it to a function that takes a &MysteryObject or Rc or other variation. In C, it's all MysteryObject* and you have no clue if that is a Box, Rc/Arc, &mut, Cow, MutexGuard, maybe a slice of &[MysteryObject]. And if you're unlucky you get functions taking or returning void*. reply bobajeff 1 hour agorootparentWell sometimes it's not actually MysteryObject. It's actually some special type like SpecificCaseMysteryObject that's been unified inside of MysteryObject but only MysteryObject is in the signature. reply bobbylarrybobby 1 hour agoparentprevI've seen this in Haskell too. “The type signature is self documenting!” Unless you're talking about the most trivial functions, that's almost never the case. reply raggi 1 hour agoprevYou can also state this without the Rust involvement: adding a duplicate of the APIs in any other dialect, going through that exercise pushes implementors to reach clarity and understanding that is more detailed and complete than any incremental code review, and you can benefit greatly if you utilize that feedback in a timely fashion to improve the code and/or docs. There's an interesting parallel here to one of the common rust feedback tropes: until rust has two implementations and a specification it's not ready; this is interesting to reflect on in context. This also came up in the video referenced in the step-down announcement, specifically just before Ted jumped in all hot, they were in the middle of about to propose to take some of what had been learned and perhaps rename or even document the C side once it was understood. Amusingly/disappointingly that suggestion which was coming was also counter to what Ted assumed they were saying. A recent personal experience example down this same path happened in the GSO paths in the network stack, where a well intentioned incremental linux change made its way through review, landed not only in head but also into stable and LTS before anyone noticed that it was broken. It had actually broken kselftests (noted by a maintainer after the report it was broken), but kselftests is quite a mess to use on any given day, so it's hard to \"spot\" regressions and demonstrably isn't used as a tool to guard against regressions consistently. Reviewers missed the semantics, and i wouldn't blame them because it turns out the semantics in question aren't explicitly or clearly written down anywhere. Last year we wrote against this interface at work, and gained substantial performance improvements, but to do so we had to read the docs, read the source, read the review threads, make assumptions, try stuff, and ultimately settle on the observed semantics more than anything else. This is a userspace interface, so it should be well defined and stable following the mantra, and it's mostly ossified now due to having real users, but it's not well documented or well understood. We follow along some of our fellow offload implementors and have seen a number struggle trying to work solely off of the docs and looking at our implementation, as they miss minor semantics - you can only get those by reading the source and patches very closely. The point of this story is that these problems of understandability cause regressions inside the kernel too, all the time. Reaching for tools to avoid this is a good idea. reply oconnor663 1 hour agoprev> Does a ref counted arg transfer the ref or does it take its own ref? This sort of thing also comes up a lot when you write Python extensions in C. You have to know the \"calling convention\" when you pass object refs in and out of functions. This entire category of problems goes away when you write extensions in Rust with PyO3, and the barrier to entry for new folks is much lower. C++ can do similar things (std::shared_ptr), but it tends to introduce new footguns in a way that Rust really doesn't. reply edfletcher_t137 1 hour agoprev [–] Another perspective which makes it clear this is The Way: it brings the promise of fully self-documenting code much closer to fruition, if not all the way! reply The_Colonel 1 hour agoparent [–] It's a false promise I stopped believing many years ago. No type system will replace docs or even comments. No type signature will give you the why, the big picture or the context.

There's an amazing range of designs, starting from the early 60's functional cassette designs, moving through the colourful playfulness of the 70's audio tapes to amazing shape variations during the 80's and 90's. We hope you enjoy these tapes as much as we do! The compact audio cassette medium for audio storage was introduced by Philips in 1963 under the name Compact Cassette. Although there were other magnetic tape cartridge systems at the time, the Compact Cassette became dominant as a result of Philips' decision (in the face of pressure from Sony) to license the format free of charge. It went on to become a popular (and re-recordable) alternative to the vinyl record deck during the 1970s. During the 1980s, its popularity grew further as a result of the Sony Walkman, with cassette sales overtaking those of LPs. (Vinyl overall remained ahead due to greater sales of singles, although cassette singles achieved popularity for a period in the 1990s). The mass production of compact audio cassettes began in 1965 in Hannover, Germany, as did commercial sales of prerecorded music cassettes (also known as musicassettes; MC for short). The system had been initially designed for dictation and portable use, thus the audio quality of early recorders was not well suited for music. Some early models also had unreliable mechanical design. As time went on, various improvements (in particular, the introduction of Dolby noise reduction) resulted in the format being taken seriously for musical use. Although its use in the West has declined as a result of more advanced technologies, it remains widespread, and is still the dominant medium for listening to music in many third world countries. In essence, the audio cassette is simply a cassette-based (and smaller) version of the older reel-to-reel tape format. It consists of two miniature reels, between which an oxide-coated plastic tape, or magnetic tape, is passed and wound. These reels (along with some other mechanical parts) are held inside a protective plastic shell. Four single audio tracks are available on the tape. These are paired to produce two stereophonic tracks – one played when the cassette is inserted with its 'A' side facing up, and the other when it is turned over (with the 'B' side up), thus mimicking gramophone records.

The nostalgic feeling seeing these photos give me cannot be put into words, esp. for those who haven’t used tapes. There were stores in my country where you would give a list of songs you wanted, select the quality of the cassette tape, and in 3-4 days would get the recordings, a primitive Spotify list. I also had a combination radio/cassette player deck on which, whenever a good song on the radio came up, I would record it, to have my own mix tapes. Recently I found, to my amazement and delight, that a robust cassette hacking culture still exists to circuit bend walkmans and create loops, eg see this course: https://dogbotic.com/cassette-hacking or the HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13386973. Tangential, but I’ve also started to at 8-track tapes. You can pick these up really cheap at estate sales and players are cheap, too. reply gregmac 59 minutes agoparent> I also had a combination radio/cassette player deck on which, whenever a good song on the radio came up, I would record it, to have my own mix tapes. Ha I did this too, starting from when I was pretty young. I had a dual-deck recorder, and would sometimes just record the radio for an hour or so, then later copy specific songs to a second tape. I remember getting so annoyed when the radio announcers would talk over the beginning/ending of a song I wanted. Eventually I started buying music on CDs but still made mix tapes for years after that, because (1) I initially didn't have a portable CD player, but I had a walkman, (2) even once I did, I still usually preferred listening to a mix vs a single album, and (3) I didn't get a CD burner until their price became reasonable. reply ChrisArchitect 14 hours agoprevRelated: https://c-90.org/ reply dr_kiszonka 14 hours agoparentI think this was my first one (a gift from dad): https://c-90.org/catalogue/tapes/Sony/Sony%20EF/0 reply PlunderBunny 9 hours agoprevSeeing the BASF cassette immediately reminded me their advertisement: https://youtu.be/CD6S8DZHpG4 reply maroonblazer 6 hours agoparentAnd this one, for Maxell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk71h2CQ_xM reply lb1lf 11 hours agoprevI got into tape trading of live shows just before CD writers became widespread - I still have a tape deck and literal crates packed with Maxell XL-IIs tapes.

    "originBody": "Member-only story Three Critical Questions to Turn the Tables During Technical Interviews Marianne Bellotti · Follow 8 min read · 22 hours ago -- 1 Questions for when your interviewer says “Do you have any questions for me?” I get really obnoxious and opinionated about how we interview potential new hires. The interview is often the best signal candidates have about what it’s like to work with us. Especially valuable candidates who are likely to have competing offers from other companies. Our interview experience should show us at our best. And that thought process carries over when I switch to the other side of the table. I expect people interviewing me for a job to both assess my skills and sell me on why joining their organization is the right move for me. But it’s not always obvious how you do that as a candidate. Especially if you’re in the earlier stages of your career. When you’re on the other side of the table, how should you best use your time in interviews to collect the most valuable data on how well the company and role might fit? The answer lies in making use of the point in the conversation when the interviewer says, “Do you have any questions for me?” Round after Round You should have a standard set of questions you plan to ask every interviewer at every stage of the interview loop.

What happens?” “Tell me about your last major migration. How long did it take and how long did you say it was going to take before you started?” “Let’s say I’m the person you hire. 6 months have gone by, what’s different?” reply nickdothutton 10 hours agoprevWhen I was more junior, one of my favourite questions to ask a company was \"Can you give me a day in the life, or a week in the life of this job/role?\". The reason being, job descriptions are very often a fantasy. An aspiration. What the company wishes its people did, not what they are actually doing. Often the reality is much less attractive than the job description you think you are interviewing for. Faced with this \"week in the life of...\" question, very few interviewers can conjure up a detailed fantasy of fictional projects concluded, smooth running operations, and friction-free collaboration on the spot. They are more likely to say what the person will _actually_ be doing. This is typically a lot less attractive. Only then you can really start \"talking turkey\" for the remaining minutes. reply claudiulodro 3 hours agoparentI ask this question every time I interview and the answer is always useless, something like “Well, it varies”. For some reason companies never want to say what they’re working on, like it’s state secrets or something. I guess that’s a signal too though. reply marcosdumay 2 hours agorootparentWell, if everybody gives the same answer there's no signal there, by definition. reply neilv 17 hours agoprevTreating the interview as two-way is good, and how it should be. A couple points: > When people struggle to answer it you still reap the rewards of letting them know that you’re not just looking for a job, you care about being successful at their company. If you publicize that in a Medium post targeting HN-like audience, aren't you just increasing the number of people will ask that question just to \"reap the rewards\" of signalling (falsely) something they think is positive? > Ask questions like: “How is the company responding to challenges from disruptors like X and Y in this space?” or “What are your thoughts on potential regulation?” If you've been having a pretty candid conversation, these questions can trigger rehearsed public/investor-facing talking point answers, which is fine, but might also knock the person back into a less-candid mode. reply makeitdouble 15 hours agoparentI think interviewer answer candidly when they care about the candidate actually thriving once they join, instead of spending a \"I'm not job hopping\" sacrificial year and get out as soon as they can. Seeing how they react to the current company strategy is a valuable in that respect, and it will be better for both of them bail out during the interviews and not after signing the contract. reply BobbyTables2 15 hours agoparentprevOr get denied an offer for using “in this space” during a technical interview. reply tdb7893 17 hours agoparentprevThe article is paywalled but I'm not a fan of suggesting particular questions in general. Unless it's relevant to the team I'm on or the candidate is genuinely knowledgeable and interested in the field then it comes across as not genuine. I've never actually mentioned that sort of thing in interview feedback but I would prefer a candidate asks what they are actually interested in knowing. reply em-bee 7 hours agoprevi don't care about most of the questions being raised here. a slow process to get changes accepted, long build cycles, bad legacy code, irrational business decisions, whatever. what i care about is how the team works together. how supportive the people i get to interact with are. how i can get help when i am stuck. if i can ask dumb questions without repercussions. if people compete or cooperate to solve problems. if they share code ownership. both on the individual and on the team level and beyond etc. if i am in a team that works well together with a supportive manager or leader then i don't care what we are working on. as long as our superiors feel that we are contributing something, even if the end result is nonsense, i'd rather do that than suffer people who are unfriendly or uncooperative or bother each other in other ways, while working on something that saves human lives. reply xtiansimon 5 hours agoparent> “…i'd rather do that than suffer people who are unfriendly or uncooperative…” I assume if you had interview questions to root out cooperative groups you would have shared. So maybe the next question would be, What management or leadership practices are indicative of a better group dynamic? Otherwise, in my experience, the group dynamic is an interpersonal dynamic— the result of quality of work the group achieves and the synergies of individuals in that process—unpredictable. reply em-bee 5 hours agorootparentto be honest, how to discover these issues in an interview is really the question. i have no idea what to ask to get that that. i mean, asking if i'll get help from my team mates is surely going to be answered with yes, whether it is true or not. same if dumb questions are ok. etc. i think you'll really have to spend a day with the team to get an even just an idea. at best in a coding interview i can find out if the interviewer is helpful when i am stuck there. or as in one interview i had, the fact that i was allowed to do the tests in a language that i was familiar with but nobody else in the company knew, at least showed that they were open minded and would accept me as an experienced programmer despite not being as experienced in the language they were using. reply Sakos 3 hours agoparentprevI've worked at a place like you describe. Supportive team, cooperation, understanding, etc. Despite whatever disagreements it was pretty great. For about 2 years. Then the stuff like irrational business decisions, difficulty getting people on board to address issues, all this institutional inertia, people saying no to everything that could possibly improve things internally. It weighed down so much that I just couldn't handle working there anymore. reply rr808 17 hours agoprevI usually try to ask these What are the bad things about this job? What's the average tenure on the team, how many people have left the team recently and why? How does this team & company compare with other places you've worked? (second or third round) How many other people are being interviewed and how do I compare? reply bradjohnson 13 hours agoparentI like the middle two questions a lot, and I try to ask them as well. I think the other two are flawed, though: > What are the bad things about this job? Too vague. Most interviewers won't be ready to shit talk their employer with this question and will say \"nothing.\" A better question would be some variation of \"What would you change about the way your team works if you could?\" Frame the question properly so that they don't set the parameters themselves. > How many other people are being interviewed and how do I compare? Comes off very insecure and gives you no useful information. It will only reflect poorly on you. reply eropple 4 hours agorootparent> Most interviewers won't be ready to shit talk their employer with this question and will say \"nothing.\" I'm not sure that's really true. I ask, verbatim, \"what sucks about this job?\" to everyone in the interview loop and I frequently get high-signal responses from it. What you're saying might be true in some places and for some (probably earlier-career) roles, but that's signal too. > Comes off very insecure and gives you no useful information. This one is true to a point, and probably depends on how it's asked (and whether you actually are insecure). Working mostly in smaller companies and startups, interviews have generally ended up at the CEO level, and a \"what's your funnel look like for this role?\" has never gone poorly while getting me pretty clear signal on whether I should toss this one in the trash or not. reply pavel_lishin 3 hours agorootparentprev> Most interviewers won't be ready to shit talk their employer with this question and will say \"nothing.\" I don't think that's true. During times I've been an interviewer, I've been open about the bad parts of the job. And if everyone tells you nothing, then that in itself is valuable information - that they're all fucking lying to you. reply mattlondon 11 hours agorootparentprevPlus any professional place will obviously have processes and rules in place to not discuss other candidates with a candidate. Sure you might be curious to know, but that is a waste of breath to ask an interviewer during a technical interview. Ask the recruiter if you must. reply alemanek 7 hours agorootparentI have asked “How do you feel I can improve as a candidate in the future?” Basically asking for a mini retro at the end of the interview process. I have found it acts as a decent proxy for how strong/weak I have done. But it also allows me to get some feedback to improve for future interviews. There has been at least one job that me asking this question directly resulted in an offer as well. reply RaftPeople 2 hours agoparentprev> What are the bad things about this job? A softer way to word this: \"What are some of the biggest challenges for this role?\" It won't get into all the dirt, but should give you some insight into things that aren't great. reply sethammons 10 hours agoparentprevI don't ask what is bad, I ask: if you had a magic wand and could fix something here, what would you fix and why? It gives me insight into their recent frustrations and often company going-ons or culture. It then opens for a potentially interesting discussion on how changes are made at the company which is particularly relevant to working in leadership roles reply franciscop 11 hours agoparentprevI had 3 different Engineers mentioning \"X person who left\" in the interviews of a company once, which triggered all sorts of red flags. Digging a bit deeper, the company had a major merger and it seemed it had gone from a super-nice environment where devs were trusted and empowered to a top-down, strict structure where they were all now fighting to stay hired. reply nopeYouAreWrong 11 hours agorootparentThis describes T-Mobile incredibly well... reply GuB-42 4 hours agoprev> Let’s say I’m the person you hire. 6 months have gone by, what’s different? What's wrong with \"you’ll be here and doing the job\"? The point of hiring someone is that there is a job to do, if you are hired and get to stay for 6 months, then you will be doing the job, if someone else is hired, he will be doing the job instead, if no one is hired, and there is no internal restructuration, then the job will not be done. For the details, just look at the job offer. I don't understand the point of asking this, even after reading the article. Why not just ask about the job directly, instead of resorting to some cryptic roundabout question? reply paradox460 4 hours agoparentIt's kind of the inverse of questions like \"why do you why to join this company\", where most interviewers would be put off by the truth, which is \"because you'll pay me\" reply Sakos 3 hours agorootparentThe point isn't necessarily to get an accurate rendition. It's to see how they answer. What they emphasize. What they don't mention. Most of the questions I ask when being interviewed are like this, ones that give me a sense of what the environment and the people are like. reply evilfred 20 hours agoprev“There’s an IC sitting out there who just had an amazing idea for a new feature/product. What happens?” in a company with more than 10 staff, they should talk to a product manager, sorry. you can't build a sustainable company by adding new features willy nilly whenever some dev has a Great Idea. reply faizshah 15 hours agoparentI don’t like the wording of the question but saying “talk to a product manager” is a red flag answer that would be the exact wrong answer an engineer would be looking for. A good manager coaches their engineers on how to package (one pager, demo, talking to partners etc.) and present their ideas to get buy-in from leadership, these types of managers are the ones hackers like. A bad manager is one who gives a dismissive “talk to a PM” answer, who doesn’t coach through the politics/process of the company and simply dismisses your ideas outright. If you hear this type of answer it gives the impression of those “just do your job and keep your head down” sort of workplaces with management that’s bad for growth. reply maccard 10 hours agorootparentThe point is that the answer shouldn’t be “just go build it”, it should be “get buy in” reply bradleyjg 8 hours agorootparent“Get buy in” > “just build it ~= “go talk to a pm” reply photonthug 15 hours agoparentprev> build a sustainable company by adding new features willy nilly whenever some dev has a Great Idea. This is hilarious because it seems to place some kind of value on a stable interface, but that is something that companies / product managers have themselves systematically destroyed over the last decade or so in pretty much every arena. Only software for professionals is even slightly immune to this (IDEs/CAD/etc). Pretty much everything else has auto-updated churn that you can't opt out of, on everything from UI to core features. Putting devs in charge of inserting features \"willy nilly\" would likely result in a much more consistent experience than what we usually get, because they'd be willing to declare something \"finished\" eventually. Product managers want the churn, because they can boost fake metrics like engagement, and it gives them stuff to do. reply YZF 14 hours agoparentprevThere needs to be some cat herding and not all ideas are great but on a strong team the devs know their product very well and understand their users very well. Amazing product managers also do that but they are a very rare beast. There's nothing wrong per se with \"talk with the product manager\" but is that where good ideas go to die or is that a productive/creative/innovative environment where teams build great stuff. A ton of stuff you use every day is \"software developer had great idea\". Even from really large companies. (p.s. using \"IC\" can already be a red flag - we don't use this terminology in the large company where I work). reply Javalicious 19 hours agoparentprevYup. Which is why this question can give some good insight into how the company runs. Is it chaotic? Suffocatingly rigid? Or is there a pipeline to triage and introduce new features in a sustainable and beneficial way? reply ang_cire 18 hours agoparentprev10? If I am the 12th hire at a company and there's already a dedicated PM there, I'm out. 100, understandable. reply icedchai 16 hours agorootparentI've seen companies where there are almost as many PMs as engineers. It's totally dysfunctional. reply kdazzle 15 hours agoparentprev“There’s a product manager sitting out there who just had a mediocre idea for some new feature. What happens?” reply jillesvangurp 14 hours agoparentprevIt's why I prefer working in startups. Less money but the amount of crippling BS you deal with is vastly less. Basically, you are the only thing on the critical path to delivering anything. A lot of what I do in startups is ruthlessly getting rid of anything that blocks me that I can't control. I do some consultancy on the side with bigger companies that are stuck in exactly the way you describe. Because the elephant in the room is usually that product managers vary widely in quality and I've seen them be a bottleneck in quite a few places. There's this weird dynamic where you get non technical product managers act more like a CTO and CTOs act more like a VP of engineering in some companies. Since I come in and advice at that level, I get to see this dynamic up close. Good ideas don't stand a chance in such companies and they actually end up paying me to tell them to stop doing stupid things that they already know they shouldn't be doing to begin with. A lot of companies are not long term sustainable because they fight themselves into corners like that. That's why consulting can be so lucrative. You just relay what engineers in the company are saying anyway to their managers. All you need to do is listen and talk authoritatively. A good company would have a culture of being open to sound engineering and be empowering people to make things better. Steve Jobs famously encouraged that in his people and got rid of people that tried to prevent that. Elon Musk apparently does similar things. Neither are/were particularly pleasant people to report to but there's a pattern in their behavior that they encourage and insist on creative and critical thinking around them. A weak manager does the opposite. Weak managers are the reason consultants like me get lucrative gigs to tell them what they should already know. reply YZF 14 hours agorootparentStartups can also have know-it-all product management. Ask me how I know. It's possible to have the best and the worst of all worlds, i.e. get paid more and be in a fairly functional environment or get paid less and be in a less functional one.

Does it happen often enough that people know what to do? When they tell you a story, they probably will minimize the gauntlet the innovator had to run. reply stavros 10 hours agorootparentprevBut then nobody is going to say \"yeah mostly we ignore them\", they're going to come up with 1-2 examples when they actually implemented it. reply dehrmann 17 hours agoprevNot sure the author realized this, but there's an interesting contradiction here. > In hiring, we standardize questions to help mitigate bias and make more accurate comparisons across a group of candidates. > The people on the ground, close to the problem are often your best bet, but organizations find it difficult to handle anything they can’t standardize and normalize. Standardizing is more fair, but at the cost (or benefit) of minimizing interesting outcomes. reply dakiol 9 hours agoprev1. The offer is good. I was aiming at 12% more, though. Can we work it out? 2.

This is not wisdom. This is over-fitting industry/era/role-specific individual experience to generic candidate advice. Do none of these things. reply stavros 9 hours agoparentThis isn't social engineering, these are actual things I want to know about a company if I'm going to spend a few years there. I typically ask much more than this. reply cbanek 14 hours agoprevA lot of times the questions I ask are literally about the job, since interviewers are so focused on trying to ask candidates things that they forget that it's a matching game, and the job has to be explained too. I'll try to \"turn the table\" early on in the interview. Ask what they are building, ask questions, say how you might design it (or have designed it in the past). All the fluffy stuff people can lie about, but getting into a good technical discussion can I think prove that both people are on the same level and can work well together. The other question I like to ask is \"why are you hiring for this job?\" This can be a real teller. Is it a group expanding due to new responsibilities? Did the last person leave in a huff? Figuring that out can really help explain the org you're about to go into. reply austin-cheney 16 hours agoprevThe first question is absolutely spot on, but I don't like the second two. Those last two tend to generate answers that are purely administrative and without substance, such as: We will perform your first mid-year review!. WTF, so what? Here are some better questions (repeating the first one from the article first): 1. “There’s an IC sitting out there who just had an amazing idea for a new feature/product. What happens?” That question is solid because it indicates they actually give a damn about employee contributions beyond what they populate on a Jira board. Its a telling sign if they are hostile to initiative. 2. \"How do you measure things related to your product and what do you measure?\" The answer to that questions addresses multiple concerns. Everybody claims to value product quality, but most places I have worked at really don't give a shit, because its just too much effort. If they aren't measuring things they have no idea how slow their product is, what kind of user engagement they achieve, their defect trajectory, and on and on and on. On a more primitive level if they aren't currently measuring things it also provides an indication of whether or not they actually want to, but maybe don't know how. The point here is you can use questions like that to cut through their bullshit and determine their level of current capability and also their level of honest versus conservatism. 3. \"What is your average build time?\" or \"How do you perform test automation?\" Most places care more about their tech stack than actually writing software. That should send all kinds of warning flags. When developers just waste time all day staring at the ceiling while software goes through a bunch of build nonsense that indicates developer time just isn't as valuable testing alternatives. its great to have 90 minute builds when the business is healthy and you can go out and go bowling, or whatever, but the moment the employer becomes unhealthy those undervalued developers will find themselves unemployed. As a bonus if you ask tough questions during the interview and the challenge makes the hiring manager uncomfortable consider they will remain as uncomfortable if you end up working there. That is really bad, because shit rolls down hill and their discomfort eventually becomes your problem. reply TheGamerUncle 18 hours agoprevhttps://archive.is/aCVkR reply workfromspace 9 hours agoparentWas looking for this.

What happens?” Sounds like a good question, but the answer doesn't really matter, because it depends on whether the business actually wants to implement the idea. And if they do, it needs to sound like it's coming from an executive, because if it's not, they'll be embarrassed and try to crush the idea. So if the dev really wants the idea to get into product, they should be funneling the idea through their manager or through a product or sales back-channel. “Tell me about your last major migration. How long did it take and how long did you say it was going to take before you started?” Bad question, because they always take longer than they expect and always run into problems, and if they don't they were just lucky. You're asking them to either embarrass themselves to you in the interview, or lie. Not going to give them great feels to remember when they think about your candidacy. Maybe ask them about migrations to see how often they do them, but don't lead them to tell you something specific. “Let’s say I’m the person you hire. 6 months have gone by, what’s different?” > You’d be surprised how often I ask this question and the answer I get back is something like “you’ll be here and doing the job” Yeah, because this is a really bad question. It's not their job to make you have an impact. It's your job to make an impact. That's why it's a job. The question should be them asking you what you will do in those 6 months to make a difference. reply lolinder 16 hours agoparent> Sounds like a good question, but the answer doesn't really matter, because it depends on whether the business actually wants to implement the idea.

Isn't this exactly the kind of answer that the question is meant to tease out, so that the candidate can know ahead of time that the company is more interested in executives' status than in innovating? I'm trying to figure out why you're framing this as a reason to not use the question instead of a great example of its utility. reply 0xbadcafebee 11 hours agorootparent> Isn't this exactly the kind of answer that the question is meant to tease out, so that the candidate can know ahead of time that the company is more interested in executives' status than in innovating? This is like asking if sharks like the taste of blood. Any answer other than the obvious is a shark looking for a meal. Executives only exist because they are obsessed with status/power, the share price, the market cap, competition, winning. That is their purpose in life. If they cared more about innovation, they wouldn't be executives, they'd be engineers. It's not impossible for an engineer to get an idea into a product. But they have to know how to swim with sharks. reply stavros 9 hours agorootparentThis makes me sad for the companies you worked for. I'm at the director level at my company, and I make sure to both give credit to whomever does good work, and to enable them to do it. I do enough good work of my own that I don't need to steal credit to be successful. reply faizshah 16 hours agoparentprevYea these questions aren’t great but if you want to ask these type of questions a better version would be: - “Can you tell me about the last time an IC on your team turned an idea into a feature/product? What was the process?” This can pinpoint whether the manager has a record of helping their directs get their own ideas into the product. - “Tell me about the challenges you ran into in your last major migration, how did you decide what technical debt falls below the line?” All migrations end up being late due to unknown unknowns, but you probably want to learn a little bit about how they managed the situation and how they decided to cut scope to still meet the new deadline. Or you could go with something like “tell me about the first 6 months of your most recent hire.” The “6 months have gone by, what’s different?” Is just a bad question. If what you’re trying to figure out is how you’ll transition from onboarding to full team member why not just ask about that directly? Also if you wanna social engineer the interview with this type of strategy, you probably should ask questions that are less focused on what they will do for you and more focused on how you can impact the organization. reply charlie0 16 hours agoparentprevI agree with your first and last answer. This is why most people can't make an impact. Even if you _could_ make one, too many layers of permission often kills the potential, or just as worse, the idea is greenlit and some other engineer with seniority leads the project; robbing you of the chance to make an impact. reply greenthrow 18 hours agoprevThese are ok generic questions, but not great. And I would encourage people to do learn as much as possible about the org/team they are interviewing for.

I don't want to have to ask questions when I don't care about the answers just because that's what \"top candidates\" are supposed to do. What you're actually measuring is how much the person you're talking to is willing to read articles like this to come up with fake questions to ask as part of a fake performance so you'll hire them. reply happyopossum 18 hours agoparentI suppose it depends on the role, but IME as a hiring interviewer, that phase of the interview can important.

That stuff comes out over time. To boot, I can think of quiet a few lies/half truths from interviewers. It is like dating, nobody says they are actually a lazy slob and the codebase is a POS on the first date. reply bdw5204 17 hours agorootparentprevFor somebody who's unemployed, especially somebody who's been unemployed a while (very common in this market), the main thing you care about is getting employed again. I imagine somebody who's currently employed wants to know that the company is better than the place they're currently at before they'd accept an offer. But sometimes \"better\" can be a very low bar to clear because their current company might be awful. In other words, evaluating the candidate by their questions is just bias towards those who are already in good situations. Somebody being unemployed or employed in a toxic environment doesn't mean there's anything wrong with them especially in an economy where companies continue to lay people off at random. reply lolinder 15 hours agorootparent> In other words, evaluating the candidate by their questions is just bias towards those who are already in good situations. It sucks for the employee, but the unfortunate truth is that filtering for someone who's already in a good situation is actually a really good filter for the employer. As you say, it doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with them, but being unable to find a job for an extended period of time—to the point where you'll look for anything and not try to filter workplaces at all—is correlated with undesirable traits. Meanwhile, being steadily employed in a chaotic market and asking questions that show you're not desperate and are evaluating me as a hiring manager are both correlated with positive traits. Again—not that any specific candidate is problematic or good because of those situations, but you will tend towards better hires overall if you watch those cues. The hiring process sucks and it sucks that this method of filtering works, but it does work. reply seadan83 15 hours agorootparent> The hiring process sucks and it sucks that this method of filtering works, but it does work. How do you know this? (That this is not just sampling error, survivor bias, and/or confirmation bias) I speculate that a good hire is almost random. Context matters as well. I worked with someone that was horrible, to later find out they were the other dev that I was going to work with later on a contract job. The different environment was night and day. That being said, I do think the signal of a horrible hire can more often than not be detected during an interview. Otherwise, IMO, there is too much noise that it is close to random. reply photonthug 14 hours agorootparentThis filter works because people that are really good at what they do naturally tend to actually care about the surrounding tools/processes involved. Someone that has no opinions at all about those tools/processes is just showing up, and people that are just showing up are not usually as good as people that are passionate about the work. That said.. it is stupid/insulting/weird to interview assembly-line workers as if you're looking for skilled artisans. Most companies/interviewers completely lack the self-awareness and ability to reflect on which category of worker they actually need/want, and may not even realize there are 2 categories. reply photonthug 15 hours agorootparentprev> For somebody who's unemployed, especially somebody who's been unemployed a while (very common in this market), the main thing you care about is getting employed again. Rather than seeing this phase of an interview as a chance to \"conform even harder\" and show smiling engagement in what is already an unfair / coercive farce, try thinking of this as an opportunity to exercise your curiosity. I mean sure you don't really care, you just need a job. But it's possible to be curious about lots of things you don't really care about. Look at that bird, I wonder where it's flying from/to. Hey it's a car parked on the street, I wonder how many people had sex in the back. Look it's a manager at a company, I wonder how they handle product ideas in that company. Being curious is easy, usually it hurts nothing, and it's a kind of muscle that benefits from flexing. Besides, especially if you've got a long drive or a long interview.. well you're stuck with it, and what else are you going to do. reply defenestration 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, your current situation does make a difference in what is important to you and which questions you have. And it also influences the balance at the interviewing table. I can imagine that it is frustrating to feel being evaluated against candidates who have the luxery of saying ‘no’ to a new job and can think critically if they want to work at the new place. Sometimes you have more freedom to say ‘no’ then you think. It can make a difference between night and day. reply kevinventullo 18 hours agoparentprevFWIW at the big tech companies I’ve worked at, that part of the interview does not have any impact on hiring decisions. reply faizshah 16 hours agorootparentIn theory it’s irrelevant in practice although companies try to make the process quantitative it is ultimately qualitative because it’s a human rating on a qualitative rubric. The impression you leave on the interviewer always makes a difference in how they represent you in their feedback and panels. It’s like in school every TA uses the same rubric yet they all grade differently. reply stevenpetryk 18 hours agoparentprevYeah. When I’m interviewing folks at my current company, and the Q&A portion begins, I tell them they can ask whatever they want or just reclaim the time; my notes are sealed. More interviewers should operate like that. reply lolinder 15 hours agorootparentYou can tell them that, but I don't think I'd believe it as a candidate. I'll assume that every interaction I have with you up until an offer is extended is going to influence your perception of me, whether you're taking notes or not. reply stevenpetryk 2 hours agorootparentI suspect most don’t believe it, and in general it’s wise to remain suspicious. But I’ll continue to reassure nonetheless. reply greenthrow 18 hours agoparentprevIf you don't have any interest why do you want to work at that organization? You just want a check? That's not a good way to spend half your waking hours during the work week. reply bdw5204 17 hours agorootparentIf you aren't already wealthy, you're probably working because \"you just want a check\". Even if the job you want is to own your own company, you still have to work until you have enough savings.

That said, if you want to run a business, and you don't like/want to do anything else, then you're kind of stuck. Unfortunately not wanting to do the job you want to get isn't generally what makes you a great hire but wanting to do a different job without having any skills also doesn't make you a great hire.

They aren't speaking \"down\" regarding ICs, they're just making their intention clear in terms of the role they're in search of.

ICs lead by example and mentorship. the fact that they’re not managing people doesn’t preclude being a leader at a company. the way i’ve heard it put for staff+ engs that i like is that they’re managers without reports. but to speak to GP’s point, they are being a bit overly sensitive. “leadership” in the context of the article likely means C-suite or director level, which usually IS mutually exclusive with an IC role.
