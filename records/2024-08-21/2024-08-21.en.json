    "commentBody": "Zen, a Arc-like open-source browser based on the Firefox engine (zen-browser.app)621 points by femou 22 hours agohidepastfavorite301 comments rchaud 1 hour agoVery cool project, happy to see a browser that's not a Chromium fork for once. Some feedback: - Web Panels: have an option for letting CTRL + Click (or other shortcut) open the link in the Web Panel sidebar. Drag and dropping the link into the sidebar would be a good shortcut as well. This works for use cases like browsing a search results page, and opening multiple links without losing focus on the search results page itself. - Horizontal Nav Bar: Vivaldi and Arc browser both have no horizontal bar taking up real estate. Maybe this is not possible to replicate with an FF fork, but having sidebar navigation AND a mostly full size top nav bar is redundant. reply explosion-s 3 hours agoprevI've recently made a similar (more modular) project which compiles various features and patches them into a Firefox profile. It can compile themes, hardening, userscripts, userstyles and more into a clean firefox profile, basically removing the bloat from firefox while still being fully customizable: https://github.com/explosion-scratch/firebuilder reply mnmalst 1 hour agoparentThis looks really great. One thing I have never seen done is having the url bar completely removed and put everything in the sidebar. That would really save some vertical space. Since you seem to know your way around the firefox sources, do you think that's possible? reply explosion-s 46 minutes agorootparentIm not sure - most of what my project does is compile multiple people's modifications together, I feel like I saw one such repo recently, I'll reply if I find it reply btown 1 hour agoparentprevReally cool! Do you know if there's anything similar for Chrome? reply explosion-s 1 hour agorootparentI don't think so, it's a lot harder to patch chrome because you'd need to recompile it. There is ungoogled-chromium but it doesn't add many features, mainly takes away the bloat. Unfortunately drm content is a bit finicky in ungoogled chromium. Firefox is great for modding because everything is contained in one profile folder, so one can simply make a new profile folder however they want and have the perfect browser reply BiteCode_dev 6 hours agoprevI've been wanting split view in FF for a long time, so I'm going to try this right now And I know somebody, somewhere, is going to argue that it should be the job of the desktop. I disagree. I don't want to have to create each context I want things to exist in, and manipulate that carefully. I like automatic context. That's why I like tabs in my browser and not a thousand windows. And that's why I enjoy my split views to be inside the tabs I just created. reply depingus 4 hours agoparentMozilla maintains a Firefox extension that does split view in the browser. Its called Side View. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/side-view/ reply lagniappe 4 hours agorootparentThat's a sidebar, they're not the same. It requires hacks to change the dimensions to a true split, and the things like zoom and extensions don't work the same in it. This is a half-measure at best. reply butz 4 hours agorootparentprev\"This add-on is not actively monitored for security by Mozilla. Make sure you trust it before installing.\" What? reply slenk 58 minutes agorootparentA lot of legitimate Firefox Addons say that. Just means Moz can't manually review every single extension if they want to allow their users a good extension experience...unlike developing Chrome extensions reply cqqxo4zV46cp 2 hours agorootparentprevI‚Äôm sure that you can piece together how this could happen. reply alimbada 4 hours agorootparentprevI've tried it.

Vivaldi is based on Chromium. reply bloopernova 5 hours agoparentprevI use vertical tabs, so I don't want 2 windows with tabs, I want 1 window with tabs-1stview-2ndview reply bogwog 3 hours agoprevI hope a sustainable Firefox fork emerges soon because it seems Google's illegal default search deals (aka the only thing keeping Mozilla afloat) are coming to an end. That's a great thing in general, but it would really suck if FF died and we all got stuck with Chrome derivatives. Personally, I wouldn't mind paying for my web browser if it's good. I wouldn't pay for Mozilla's FF, but I would pay for a fork of it by a company whose business model doesn't involve ads or selling data. I happily pay for Kagi, and will happily pay for the app that I use the most. reply bearjaws 3 hours agoparentMozilla could keep building FF without Google, but it would require that 90% of the C suite get laid off and dedicated focus from the company... reply KennyBlanken 1 hour agorootparentGood. They've lost market share continuously for fifteen years. In 2009 they had a 30% market share. Now they have a 5-6% market share. 4/5ths of their market share, gone. reply choilive 1 hour agorootparentThe number of internet users have also gone up 300% over that time period, so on absolute terms they still have a sizeable user base.. but yes. They need to figure out how to increase market share. reply fabrice_d 1 hour agorootparentThey are even losing users in absolute terms: check https://data.firefox.com/dashboard/user-activity reply beefnugs 57 minutes agorootparentprevNah, they would just enshittify like everyone else. This world is trash. The only hope is it pisses off enough people for them to contribute to some open competitor, the circle of softwarelife reply widdershins 12 hours agoprevNot many straightforwardly positive comments here so far, so I will write one. I'm a Firefox user but I've recently been tempted by Arc primarily because of its 'workspaces' feature and its minimal UI that gets out the way. I used Arc for several weeks and really got a taste for these features, so I'm really happy to see them come to a Gecko-based browser. Thank you, and keep it up! My advice would be: don't advertise wooly claims about performance and security, when it's not clear exactly what's different from Firefox there. Instead, focus on this simple fact: it's an alternative UI for Firefox-based browsing, and that's great. reply thisislife2 0 minutes agoparent> don't advertise wooly claims about performance and security And about privacy ... reply dao- 11 hours agoparentprevAgreed. I work at Mozilla as an engineer for Firefox, and I'm generally happy to see this. I currently work on tab groups, and I'm curious to see what their implementation will look like or whether they'll try to fast-track our work-in-progress once that's somewhat viable. For the sidebar and vertical tabs, they seem to have implemented their own thing rather than using what our team has been working on. At a first glance, the results look similar. I wonder if they'll want to ditch their implementation once we've released, as forking this stuff long-term may not be super cost efficient. Their claims about performance do seem dubious. Mostly they seem to tweak a bunch of Firefox prefs, but more often than not there are good reasons for Firefox's defaults, and changing them may come with a tradeoff. reply nokeya 11 hours agorootparentTab groups again? I don‚Äôt remember when exactly, but like 10 years ago Firefox already had this feature. I was using them happily, organising all my numerous tabs to a dozen of groups by theme (work, social, movies, etc). But then Mozilla decided: ‚ÄúNobody is using tab groups, screw it!‚Äù and removed them. All groups and tabs were lost. Now history will repeat? reply Vinnl 11 hours agorootparentI think you're referring to Panorama View [1], introduced in Firefox 4 (2010). I think there are still extensions that replicate the experience [2]. There are many things different now that might make it work better this time. If not just that it's 14 years later, different UI, and the pattern being familiar from other browsers, might make a difference too. But no guarantees, of course. (Note: I don't work on Tab Groups.) [1] https://web.archive.org/web/20110613070035/http://www.azaras... [2] https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/simple-tab-groups/ is widely used, but I'm not sure if it does the overview. Other extensions do. reply capitainenemo 6 hours agorootparentThere's also https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1509350 filed in 2018 for restoring it, now duped against this official bug... https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1907090 reply cxr 4 hours agorootparentprevPanorama from Firefox 4. Also called Tab Groups. reply dao- 11 hours agorootparentprevI remember, I was around back then. :) Panorama was in some ways ahead of its time. The UI was nice visually but also somewhat heavy handed / not very beginner friendly to say the least, which contributed to it being used only by a relatively small share of our user base. We're cautious about not repeating history. We're implementing tab groups from scratch and directly in the tab bar. Our Firefox View feature (Tools > Firefox View) may later get a more visual surface for managing groups. reply nokeya 10 hours agorootparentIt was used by advanced users. And what advanced users do? Disable telemetry;) So, I suppose the share was a little bigger but not that much. reply eddyg 4 hours agorootparentOr, just don't disable (anonymous) metrics. There's a BIG difference between tracking and metrics, but they are often treated the same, especially by \"power users\". reply Y_Y 8 hours agorootparentprevMaybe instead of ubiquitous stupidity-tqxax telemetry we could have some neo-Nielsen families and get to pick a roughly representative sample out of voluntary, compensated users. A trusted third party contracts the victims and agregates the data. Don't ask me who regulates or pays though. reply jackstraw14 8 hours agorootparent> A trusted third party And why wouldn't it be Nielsen :) I remember when they sent me cash in the mail as a kid, fun times. reply cbsks 7 hours agorootparentThey still do that. Just a few weeks ago my daughter filled out their survey and got $5! reply jackstraw14 4 hours agorootparentThat's so cool, mine was about 30 years ago. I had no idea they were still doing this! reply justinclift 7 hours agorootparentprev> which contributed to it being used only by a relatively small share of our user base. And that's why telemetry is such a brain dead idea. People then actually make decisions based upon \"number of people using feature X\" which is incredibly... lets just say \"unwise\". reply 1oooqooq 6 hours agorootparentwonder if we should just accept it as \"voting\" and monitor their telemetry experiment and spam the option we would like reply ReadCarlBarks 2 hours agorootparentYou can vote for features on Mozilla Connect: https://connect.mozilla.org/ reply justinclift 5 hours agorootparentprevMight be more accurate. ;) reply jay_kyburz 9 hours agorootparentprevI never understand the need for tab groups, once you get above 4-5 tabs you are actively working in, whats wrong with bookmarks? reply KingMob 9 hours agorootparentBookmarks are perceptually longer-term than open tabs, so there may be more reluctance to save to a bookmark. (E.g., if planning a trip to Italy, do you want to bookmark some blogger's food recs for Rome, forever?) But worse is, it relies on recalling the text in the bookmark's title to resurface it. You might not remember the page title, but you can always scan through open tabs. reply miah_ 5 hours agorootparentI wrote love the ability to associate a TTL with bookmarks. Let me bookmark for 3 hours or 2 days or forever. Of course the 3 and 2 are user choices. Mostly the way I deal with this now is sharing the tab to another Firefox on a different computer then use it there and decide it's fate. reply krferriter 38 minutes agorootparentThis is an interesting idea for a feature, that I think I would like too. I like to save things to maybe look at later and a TTL would manage automatically dropping them from bookmarks in case I never actually want to look at it later. reply torstenvl 7 hours agorootparentprevI add a folder to my bookmark bar. All project related tabs get bookmarked there. When I'm done, I either delete the whole folder or file it somewhere. I can also open all in tabs, if I really want to. reply PrototypeNM1 3 hours agorootparentprevThink of it like memory hierarchies. Bookmarks are long term storage, tabs are registers. Tab groups fall somewhere in the middle, easy to reengage with and easy to put out of focus. reply cxr 3 hours agorootparentprevI use Firefox's existing native support for tab groups that it's had since pre-1.0. They're called windows. reply proaralyst 8 hours agorootparentprevWork make me use Chrome, and I have recently converted hard to tab groups. I've found two main uses: one for a collection of reference tabs that I mostly want open or closed together (specific API references that are normally spread out over a few pages); the other is to organise groups of tabs for different projects I'm working on. Both of these make context switching easier as I can quickly hide all of the tabs I'm not currently using, knowing they'll be just as easy to reopen later. In Chrome, tab groups can be saved too, so they give you a bit of the persistence of bookmarks. I'm still a Firefox user where I have a choice, and I'm really excited to hear they're working on first-class tab groups reply slightwinder 5 hours agorootparentprevBookmarks suck. They are slow and cumbersome to manage, especially when it's many related urls. And for working with them, I need to open them as a tab anyway, so why not stay there from the beginning? reply superkuh 1 hour agorootparentprevBookmarks don't have tab history. reply josh-sematic 5 hours agorootparentprevGlad to hear Mozilla is working on adding this. I switched to a chrome-based browser for a while and the only thing I miss after going back to Firefox is tab groups. reply BodyCulture 8 hours agorootparentprevFirefox is the only browser that freezes Ubuntu after some extensive internet use, especially with video watching. Since many years and still today. reply csouzaf 2 hours agorootparentI'm not sure how this contributes to the thread. This isn't a technical support forum, so it might not be the best place to discuss specific browser issues. I've been using Firefox on Ubuntu since 18.04 was first released (about 6 years ago), and while I've encountered some issues, I haven't experienced the problem you're describing. Of course, browser performance can be affected by many factors in your system. If you're seeking help, you might have better luck in a dedicated support forum or the official Firefox support channels. reply codethief 2 hours agorootparentprevDoes it freeze completely (forcing you to resort to kill -9) or is it just slow? In any case, I've been been a Ubuntu user since ~2010 (and a Firefox user since its inception). I remember there being a time when Firefox was slower than Chrome and freezing occasionally but that was a looong time ago and I haven't had any issues with performance or freezes/crashes ever since. reply 1oooqooq 6 hours agorootparentprevhappens to me too. but i would bet money it's because of memory corruption in both of our cases. i have the exact same setup on ECC ram and zero crashes. on non ECC (cheap, garbage, that everyone accepted as the default) ram, one crash every couple weeks. so unless you can prove software on the same cpu is non deterministic, it is ram corruption. reply BossingAround 4 hours agorootparentprevI've never used Ubuntu, but on Fedora and openSUSE Tumbleweed, I've never run into this issue (and I've had like 50+ tabs open for weeks since i don't really reboot my work laptop unless I have to) reply mkesper 7 hours agorootparentprevAre you using the snap version? I don't doubt that will give a crappy experience. reply Croftengea 2 hours agorootparentprevNative vertical tabs in vanilla FF? Whoohoo! Imho, the killer feature is automatic group assignment based on URL patters. Will the vanilla implementation support it? reply viraptor 11 hours agorootparentprev> I currently work on tab groups (It's happening.gif) But seriously, that makes me extremely happy. I'm using the weird hack in tree style tabs to do this and it's not great. I'd love this to work in general and something with a persistent \"current context\" for new tabs. reply Vinnl 11 hours agorootparentIf you're unfamiliar with Sidebery, it's similar to TST but has a neat tab groups feature as well. Speaking of, there are other cool new features coming to Firefox - such as vertical tabs: https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/here-s-what-we-re... reply viraptor 9 hours agorootparentThanks, sideberry looks great. I've defaulted to TST for so long, I haven't looked for alternatives, but it seems worth trying. reply methuselah_in 7 hours agorootparentprevits good to see you giving direct feedback. reply 1oooqooq 7 hours agorootparentprevFirefox defaults lately are awful and out of touch... gestures for reload/back/forward? really? several decades and still not incorporating uBlockOrigin as a native feature? really? a convoluted only-4-containers shenanigans that not even the author understand instead of simply isolating private tabs per window like everyone asked over the years? using on android? too bad now you don't have half the settings available, AND you will not access many extension for no technical reason other than mozilla implemented a blacklist! ...oh and no access to about:config either! i don't recall many examples because i gave up caring and have a list of settings (most not even available in the settings screen) and extension i must install on Firefox every new install which is larger than my OS customizations.... and on android i did what anybself respecting person would do and never touch Mozilla's default. install F-DROID's instead. so, no, Firefox defaults are not very good. reply downsplat 3 hours agorootparentFor Android, I've been using Firefox Beta as my daily driver for over a year, it works flawlessly, and about:config is available. reply 1oooqooq 28 minutes agorootparentyeah, even the very own devs HATE the defaults someone (who?) decided for android. first there was a non documented setting to remove the blacklist for extensions... when they blocked access to about:config then everyone started using firefox dev... now they removed the block from nightly (i guess using real bleeding edge dev annoyed them)... anyway, this only proves me point even harder. reply autoexec 2 hours agorootparentprevThey've automatically added spying by default now too. Mozilla is now an ad-tech company. Don't expect defaults to get any better. reply yonrg 5 hours agorootparentprevI'm a firefox-only user, and I read your comment in two ways. It's grumpy, but also on the point! Thanks, I feel similarly. What is your main browser btw? FF works for me in great ways, and I am highly productive with it, as long as some plugins still work: uBlock, tridactyl, foxyproxy. And for UI: sidebery, stylus. From time to time I feel I should turn my back towards FF when they come up with new decisions in their UI, which I drastically reduce (no menu, no tabs,...), or new features, which are more disturbing than helping. On android, I discovered 'kiwi browser' which is FF based but does not blacklist the plugins. reply mnmalst 2 hours agorootparentMan you got my hopes up for a bit there since I remembered Kiwi browser was chromium based which after checking, it still is. From there website: \"Kiwi is based on Chromium and WebKit.\" https://kiwibrowser.com/ reply slightwinder 5 hours agorootparentprev> several decades and still not incorporating uBlockOrigin as a native feature? really? Might be better that way. AdBlockers are fast-moving, with a dedicated, diligent working community. Outside the browser, they probably can work better. reply fabrice_d 2 hours agorootparentNot just that, but why would Mozilla pick the winner here? Everyone complains about the side effects of default search engines, let's not do it again with ad-blockers! And anyway, their Google contract certainly prevents them from doing shipping ad-blocking by default. reply 1oooqooq 24 minutes agorootparentbecause that was the original promise with extensions! contribute without the red tape, and if enough people like it, we will incorporate. heck dev tools started as someone cloning IE dev tool as an extension... there were two... the IE clone and a dalvik debugger... mozilla had no problem picking the winer and incorporating in the official build. > their google contract stop normalizing this! they officially denie this arrangement exist! so they cannot use it as an excuse. reply 1oooqooq 26 minutes agorootparentprevthe extension already incorporates a interface to select/finetune/update the rules. for the past decade updates to the extension itself have been UI only. reply cma 6 hours agorootparentprev> several decades and still not incorporating uBlockOrigin as a native feature? really? How much less will Google pay to be the default search if this is added? reply 1oooqooq 5 hours agorootparentbut they will never say that out loud ;) so what is the official position? they don't even have one. nobody touch tickets mentioning these things. so sad how open source is so easily coopted. i remember when google and Microsoft had to do the w3c misdirection, now they don't even pretend. reply espadrine 10 hours agoparentprevProduct presentation is a hard-to-develop skill. I agree that many aspects of the page are muddy. I personally find their compact mode the cleanest I have ever seen. This is the entire window: https://imgur.com/hhfyeVz To access the address bar, move the mouse to the top, or type Ctrl+L. For the tabs, move the mouse to the left, or type Ctrl+1, 2‚Ä¶ or Ctrl+Tab to cycle through. I wish Firefox had such a compact mode. reply charlie0 4 hours agoparentprevTried Arc and didn't like it. It's main selling point is the workspaces. However, I'm not the type of person to have 200 tabs open at once, so it wasn't as useful for me as I thought it would be. It's def a nice looking app though. reply angryasian 3 hours agoparentprevYou should try Firefox Mozilla containers https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account... This is official supported add-on reply czk 48 minutes agorootparentThis is the main reason I still use Firefox.

Other sites/applications aren't going to be using this custom protocol handler, and if it's just for my own browser then I'm going to be creating containers and then setting \"always open site in this container\" and Firefox will always open that site in a specific container. What are you using this for? reply mdaniel 1 hour agorootparent> Other sites/applications aren't going to be using this custom protocol handler I have my own xdg-open in the PATH which supersedes the /usr/bin one (I believe there actually is a plugin mechanism for xdg-open but I found it easier to just create my own binary than learn their tomfoolery), and with that in mind, I'm able to make any URL routing decisions I'd like via that > then setting \"always open site in this container\" ... which won't work for multi-tenant sites like console.aws.amazon.com or portal.azure.com which use cookies or other such nonsense to determine who you are currently logged in as. That's actually true of Google and Microsoft, too, although I have less day-to-day experience with that. I am, of course, aware of the user switcher built into both AWS and Azure consoles, but it's not the same as having a giant red themed container for production accounts versus green for QA ones As for your specific question, I also use aws-vault to cook federated login URLs for the console because my experience of working with AWS SSO and Okta is some ... it's a lot of clicking ... versus letting aws-vault build the federated signin URL and then launching it into the container named according to its AccountID (so it's easy to programatically dispatch them) reply gchamonlive 6 hours agoparentprevI might be willing to try it because of these workspaces. How does It differ from Firefox Profile Manager? reply autoexec 3 hours agoparentprevIf they commit to keeping all Firefox's spying out of their Firefox-based browsing UI that's all I really need.

I migrated from Vivaldi to Firefox because of it. reply prometheon1 6 hours agorootparentSame! I switched back from Brave to Firefox last year after discovering that Sidebery has tab panels (which I think Arc calls workspaces) that can be set to use the same Firefox container. I want to be logged into different accounts of the same service, in Brave I had different \"profiles\" for this, but I like that now in Firefox I can have everything in a single window and I can easily switch between containers by switching to a different panel. (Which I have a hotkey for) reply chown 4 hours agoprevI've recently started using Arc mostly out of FOMO and there are parts that I like and parts I don't. I have been a Firefox user for a long time before that so glad to see something similar that's one of the major priorities is the aesthetics and I very much appreciate that.

Keep it up! reply cropcirclbureau 2 hours agoprevI'll say it again, the golden standard for workspaces and sidebars is Sideberry and it's written for Firefox. Always glad to see new browser chrome efforts building on Firefox but it's such a high bar. Will still give this a try though. reply commercialnix 14 hours agoprevI use Sway (an i3 clone for Wayland), so these \"split views\" and \"workspaces\" are not appealing to me. Zen makes serious claims about performance and sandboxing, but do not forwardly present writings on how they do these things, leaving us with the impression there are some tweaks here and there but not much more. reply zamadatix 14 hours agoparentI'm a Sway user as well but I still find value in features like workspaces, tabs, and split views in certain apps even though they are all also features in Sway. Sometimes a particular split (or any of those other things) can itself be a context I want to switch to in part of my current view. Rather than individually orchestrate that from wherever the components are into my current view it can be nice to define that relation more directly via something like this. Not saying such features in apps must also be appealing to you as well or anything equally silly, just whether or not they are appealing is more hinged on that base question of whether you like the idea of nested organizational structures than whether or not your window manager has a similar tiling feature. reply gorgoiler 14 hours agoparentprevI‚Äôve been using the sway family of window managers for nearly 20 years! (First ion2, then ion3, then i3, and now sway.) In all this time I‚Äôve briefly used native tabs but mostly now use windows without title bars or any other decorations in split mode all of the time. Most of the day I simply have a terminal running tmux on the first workspace with vim in the first tmux window, shells in the others, and a browser on the second sway workspace. Would I benefit from using native windows in sway? It often feels like vim splitting, tmux splitting, Firefox tabs, and sway windows are all fighting with against other or at the very least not cooperating when they could be doing a better job if they all deferred to sway. I‚Äôm just not sure how to do that well with easy switching between windows and I don‚Äôt know if vim even supports it at all unless I use gvim? reply bee_rider 3 hours agorootparentTmux splits are really nice on the server, and getting the server and my local system to be aware of each other is‚Ä¶ either very difficult or impossible. Tmux and vim splits, the competition between them can be a little annoying. Mostly I prefer tmux splits, but the shared yank buffers and ability to link scrolling in vim is really nice. You can open a terminal in vim somehow IIRC, maybe vim as a multiplexer is the way to true enlightenment, haha. reply joshmarinacci 3 hours agorootparentprevCould you provide some screenshots? I‚Äôd love to see what your desktop looks like with this configuration. reply granra 11 hours agorootparentprevI used to also use i3 and later sway and I noticed I only ever tiled my terminals. I don't really remember why but I started using tmux (with tilish) and I liked that I can detach and reattach to sessions later. But at that point I'm just full screening windows so now I'm on gnome and use a single terminal window with tmux :) Edit: my journey of text editors has been vim -> neovim -> helix so I just have them open inside the tmux sessions. reply gorgoiler 11 hours agorootparentAnother part of my journey is moving to entirely local development rather than ssh-ing from a $2000 MacBook (running a Linux virtual machine) to a $5000 dev server. I now use native Linux on a $250 mini PC to write my glue code and k8s to hand off all my big compute tasks. But what that really means is, while ssh-tmux-vim is great when you need it, local UIs could be so much richer, and I would never know because I am still tied to using my local machine as if it were a remote host. I should stop writing about it and just do something. I have a feeling that using native sway tabs for everything might be fantastic, if I can get over the hump of making the change. reply dotancohen 10 hours agorootparentprevAs a very longtime VIM user, can you talk me into helix? reply granra 3 hours agorootparentI'm not one for preaching about software :p I thought I'd miss the infinite extendability of neovim with all my plugins and such but it didn't end up mattering to me and it was quite freeing actually to be just bound to what is supported in the core editor (as long as it's enough for you). I've been waiting for editorconfig support since before switching but it doesn't look like it will be merged into core. Afaik there's plans to add plugin support using some custom lisp language which I'm excited about (I wrote all my neovim config in fennel). But overall it's really fast and comes with essentials built-in like LSP and tree sitter support. There's some learning curve coming from vim in terms of key commands and such as helix is inspired by kakoune in that realm. I don't think I did a really good job at convincing you but that's what came from my head quickly :D reply dotancohen 1 hour agorootparentThanks you! I will take a look.

It‚Äôs so presumptuous and conveys vanity. Moreover, users may prefer their software to be utilitarian, and in any case are likely to have different opinions on what constitutes ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù. For that aspect: Show, don‚Äôt tell. If people do find it beautiful, then they don‚Äôt need to be told. And if they don‚Äôt, then telling them is unlikely to change that. reply BiteCode_dev 7 hours agoparentI read it the opposite way: - I feel more passion from the author. - I value the pride they show in their work. - I know many people actually care about beauty. In fact, with the same amount of bugs, the users of the most beautiful software will actually report it's less buggy. The problem is when someone makes appearances more important than being useful.

You don't know the developers wrote it. And if a non-developer wrote it, then that person probably isn't going to commit the content to a repo. reply dartos 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is based on Firefox, so it doesn‚Äôt really help with browser diversity. Ladybird does, but it‚Äôs not really ready for prime time yet reply BiteCode_dev 5 hours agorootparentOf course it does. Right now FF shares are so low devs are ignoring it. If more browsers use this engine, more devs will test with it. Also, if it reaches success, it make FF future more robust, which also helps with future diversity. reply dartos 5 hours agorootparentNo way. If google decides that they don‚Äôt want to fund Mozilla anymore, then these Firefox derivatives fall as well. I don‚Äôt really see the zen team (or other ff forks) hiring the FF devs that are making 6 figures at Mozilla. If Firefox decides to deeply ingrain some DRM standard, there‚Äôs a high likelihood that it‚Äôll be included in downstream browsers like this one, unless they are privacy nuts like librewolf. We need entirely new browsers that are more than window dressing on top of existing ones. reply immibis 5 hours agorootparentRemember what happened to Thunderbird, though.

And Mozilla Corp is something different altogether. reply manuelmoreale 4 hours agorootparentprev> Thunderbird operates in a for-profit subsidiary of the non-profit Mozilla Foundation. I guess the answer is yes. reply beAbU 5 hours agorootparentprevThe first sentence in the first paragraph on the website is \"beautifully designed\". Clearly the creator wants to bring to our attention that they spent a lot of time designing the visual aspects of this browser. And from the looks of things, this is indeed true. The browser does look very beautiful. But... this is literally form over function. Browsers should be like car tyres. Only after you have selected for your functional use case and requirements, do you filter for visual aesthetics. reply InsideOutSanta 6 hours agoparentprevI like it, because it shows the author's aspiration. Not all software aims to be visually appealing, which is totally fine. But depending on what the software is, aesthetics are something that I find important. For browsers in particular, that is a major reason why I don't use any of the existing Firefox forks: they are all very utilitarian. But I look at a browser window pretty much all day long, so I prefer a visual design that brings me joy. reply TedDoesntTalk 5 hours agorootparent> I prefer a visual design that brings me joy This sounds like a marketing-speak. Joy is not an experience gained by staring at the visual design of a browser. You are confusing joy and another experience, perhaps appeal or attraction. If you genuinely experience joy from browser visual design, you are probably that same guy who experiences ‚Äúdelight‚Äù when a customer support representative treats you well on a phone call. reply InsideOutSanta 1 hour agorootparentWhy are you spending your time explaining to people you've never met what kinds of emotions they feel, or how legitimate their emotions are? reply Y_Y 5 hours agorootparentprevCan we just have two separate things? One is a browser that works well, and the other could be maybe some pretty pieces of paper that you can stick over the UI elements that don't spark joy for you. reply InsideOutSanta 1 hour agorootparentWhy do they ned to be separate? reply moffkalast 6 hours agorootparentprevThat's probably for the best, every time Firefox tries to make itself look nicer they manage to make UX worse in the process. reply wccrawford 6 hours agoparentprevI feel the same, and not just about \"beautiful\". Any time a marketing person tells me how to think about their product, it pushes me away. Tell me what it is, now how I should think about it. reply niam 5 hours agorootparentThat's my instinct when people describe themselves, too. e.g in dating profiles when people remark about how \"I'm smart, funny\", etc. They may be both of those things! But I can't help that my first conceit is always to think \"that's not yours to decide here\". reply gexla 6 hours agorootparentprevImagine having an artist who does paintings and an architect both come up with a concept for a building. Then have each explain their design decisions and why you might select that concept. Each are going to use much different language, though each concept might still be described as beautiful by a judge. Of course, you still need to craft your language to appeal to the buyer, but an architect can probably still do that more effectively. And that architect likely isn't going to use the word \"beautiful.\" The architect's message would likely resonate with me because I could feel the domain knowledge and craft skills shining through. reply mionhe 5 hours agorootparentI think you be comparing an amateur artist with a professional architect (which isn't surprising; amateur architects are very rare and professional artists have less visibility.) Only amateur artists would actually describe their work as \"beautiful\". If you go to a gallery or museum and read what a professional artist says about their own work (usually found on little cards next to paintings/scriptures/etc.) their descriptions tend to be about much more focused on what they were trying to convey and how they used that medium to do it. This is also what I've seen from professional architects. That doesn't mean you would be any more swayed by the professional artist, but it's at least more apples to apples. reply gexla 5 hours agorootparentA couple of things on this... If only an amateur would use the word beautiful, then was it an amateur who wrote the content for this site? The core of my comment was that different professions use different language. In your example, I may find a similar level of skillful description of their work, but that's not going to cross over into different domains. The architect would likely write a more compelling pitch for a building design concept than an artist who is a painter. The artist may not use the word \"beautiful\" but still may use other language which is a similar miss in domain language used for a successful pitch. In my field, I have to sell software development services to customers who may not be technical. I have to be careful to limit the depth of my technical explanations. But I'm still going to use just enough domain language that the customer will intuitively understand that I have a better grasp of the work to be done than the newly hired sales guy who is doing a pitch for the company he represents. Here's a snippet from \"above the fold.\" > Beautifully designed, privacy-focused, and packed with features. Packed with features? That's like creating a menu item in your site nav entitled \"Stuff\" or \"Misc.\" Maybe they were just in a hurry. reply lo_zamoyski 5 hours agorootparentprevYou mean \"tell me what it does\". Beautiful is what a thing is. And what a thing does follows from what it is. Contrary to modern misconception, beauty is objective. Taste is subjective. What makes good taste is alignment of the subjective with the objective. So, in this case, we can ask \"what makes a browser beautiful?\". Well, since it is a tool, then its usefulness is intrinsic to the kind of thing it is. So, how useful it is as browser is constitutive of its beauty, as beauty has to do with the perfection with which something realizes the kind of thing it is. reply Y_Y 5 hours agorootparent> You mean \"tell me what it does\". Beautiful is what a thing is. And what a thing does follows from what it is. If they state in the readme that it's a web browser and I can compile it using GNU make then I'll believe them. If they say it's whizzy fast and easy to learn then I'll consider that's probably somewhat true. If I read \"beautiful\" and \"paradigm-changing\" and \"redefines the browsing experience\" then I imagine they're just trying to puff themselves up without having anything concrete to back it up. It's true that things can be beautiful, and there are some universal (enough) beauty standards. The signal of being beautiful is not saying \"look how beautiful I am\" though. It's easy to claim something like that and hard to refute, so it's not a very good signal. The beauty should speak for itself, or at least be attested to be a third-party like with a quote from a review. reply hoistbypetard 7 hours agoparentprevI don't find it off-putting. I may or may not agree that the software is beautiful because, as you point out, people often have different opinions on what constitutes beauty. All the same, I find it useful to know that the authors of the software consider \"beauty\" one of their goals. And beauty does not preclude utility. reply nosioptar 3 hours agoparentprevAlso, beauty is in the eye of the beerholder. I don't consider the screenshots of Zen to be beautiful by any measure.

If I'm going to put in the effort to create something like this. There is ONE powerful reason which compels me to do this. If I'm pitching this to an investor, then I need to craft a message to convince the investor to hand over money. The above line is wasting space. I get a sense that the message is either crafted by developers who are horrible at doing so, or by copy people who know nothing about the product. And in neither case does anyone spend significant time finding and interacting with passionate potential users to find what sorts of messaging resonates with them. As with writing, you need to find your voice, and let that voice drive the messaging. Personally, I wouldn't even bother starting such a project if I didn't get to the \"find your voice\" part. Maybe the developers have some hand-wavy plan to sell options and accessories rather than having a strong starting point to solving a problem. reply mthoms 5 hours agorootparentCome on.

The sidebar is missing some hover popups so one can know what the buttons mean; animations, in general, are not very good, making the interface look rough; some parts of the regular firefox interface are just \"glued in\", and they feel a bit alien / missing integration (bookmarks, history...); tab bar at right side not working, although there is a button for it (useful for wide monitors in which you pin the window to the right side).

Personally I don‚Äôt find profiles that useful just for the fact that I simply use different browsers for personal and work‚Ä¶ but a use case for profiles is, for example, to be signed in as admin and user to your local dev web application and test things between the two just by changing tabs instead of having to logout and login reply slightwinder 5 hours agoparentprevWorkspace is mainly just managing Tabs.

Some tabs are actually multi-tab (split screen). The folders themselves have a neat feature whereby active tabs can be shown while hiding inactive tabs located in the same folder. I can also switch to a specific space with a user defined hotkey, and customize the color of each workspace. Each workspace can have its own profile (and history) or you can share profiles between workspaces. You choose. None of those on their own are groundbreaking, but all together they make for a compelling differentiator (for me anyways, but I have ADHD so prioritize different things than most).

I'm surprised Mac users are noticing a difference though, I find the difference basically vanishes on really high res displays (like my QHD-ish panel on my Framework 13). reply pjerem 11 hours agorootparentPixels aren‚Äôt noticeable anymore in such resolutions but font rendering and anti aliasing may still impact perceived contrast and crispness. Though, on such displays, disabling AA totally is a viable option but it will still feel different. reply pjerem 11 hours agorootparentprevInteresting, font rendering is the number one thing that makes me hate Electron apps (I have so much more reasons to hate Chrome). It‚Äôs to the point that I just can‚Äôt use, say, VS Code on a monitor that is not Hi-DPI. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not saying that the font doesn‚Äôt look better. Maybe it‚Äôs aesthetically more pleasing but to me, it‚Äôs just harder to read. I have multiple eye issues that may not help and which make me more demanding but since I don‚Äôt have this issue with OS rendered fonts, I consider this to be an issue. reply christophilus 10 hours agoparentprevSlack video chat works only in Chrome.

However, I recently also had issues with Sony, where the login page would error out every single time with Safari and Firefox. Chromium worked just fine.

Engines are the most difficult part to build and coordinate around. WebKit is open source and gets contributions from across the industry. It would make sense for most people to coalesce around that single target. The browsers built around the engine are the feature-filled interfaces people care about and where competition should happen. The engine has no opinions about tracking or tabs or built-in services. As soon as we argue we need unique engines, there are now multiple competing standards for developers to target. In fact, I'd bet that future engines that cite issues with WebKit as their motivation for a fork or a from-scratch rewrite will start using the tagline \"WebKit-compatible\" because that standard is so important. reply DHPersonal 5 hours agorootparentThe issue with a single browser having dominance is that the largest contributor to that project doesn‚Äôt just control the project, they control the Web. reply Kokouane 15 hours agoparentprevThey only compared to Firefox-based browsers which does make sense.

    "originBody": "I've Built My First Successful Side Project, and I Hate It 19 Aug 2024 22 minutes read #Business In 2020, I built my first side project. I scratched my own itch, then started selling it, and since then, the project has earned me over $15,000. But a few months after releasing it, I was so tired of the maintenance that I wanted to shut it down. Here is a story about my short entrepreneurial adventure. Gumroad dashboard with the earnings from my project In the second part of 2020, I had some spare time. I just finished a project for a client, and I've decided to dedicate a few months to making a Python course ‚Äì just to try something new. At the same time, I became interested in using technical analysis to trade stocks. Following one of the \"internet investment gurus\" (yes, I know how bad it sounds), I started day-trading stocks following some \"mystical knowledge\" on how to leverage price formation called \"harmonic patterns\" to figure out when to buy or sell (look, I'm sorry, I also cringe when I write those words). Like many traders investors, I was using TradingView, the most popular free platform for technical analysis. Compared to the tools offered by stock brokers at that time, TradingView was far superior with its user-friendly web interface and a plethora of tools. You could even write your own scripts using an abomination of a scripting language called PineScript to implement all sorts of additional tools, graphs, and metrics for your charts. But there was no script that would draw harmonic patterns for me, and after a few days of drawing them manually, I got tired and decided to automate the process. It took me a few weeks to learn the language and implement a script to automatically draw harmonic patterns on the chart. The script significantly decreased the time I had to spend searching for stocks to trade. Then, I wrote another script - one that was drawing potential future patterns. Great! If those scripts work for me, maybe someone will pay money to use them too. After all, the idea of harmonic patterns wasn't new ‚Äì the earliest harmonic pattern, the \"Gartley Pattern\", was first described in 1935. There are books, articles, and videos on this topic, so for sure, I wasn't the only one using them. Luckily for me, TradingView supports selling access to scripts, although in a slightly convoluted way. With the most expensive subscription, if you publish your script with \"invite only\" access, you can control which users can use it. So, I bought that subscription and created a landing page connected to Gumroad to accept payments for monthly and yearly subscriptions. Promoting my scripts # Now, I needed to find a way to tell TradingView's users about my scripts, as those \"invite only\" scripts are not easy to find. TradingView doesn't promote them in the search results; instead, it prioritizes free-to-use scripts with publicly available source code. And even if someone found my scripts or my website, I needed to convince them that my scripts are useful and do what they are supposed to do. Even though I offered a 14-day money-back guarantee on any subscription, people were reluctant to give their credit card details on some random website. So, I've created a couple of smaller scripts by reusing large chunks of code from the existing scripts. Their source code was still hidden, but people could use the scripts for free - with limited functionality: you could find only some types of price formations there was a limit to how many past days you could check there were no automatic notifications when a new pattern appeared Still, people liked them and started using them. When they asked about missing features like the notifications or detecting more patterns, I directed them to the paid scripts. Then, I published some \"ideas\" on TradingView - screenshots of popular stocks with drawings of the existing and potential future harmonic patterns generated with my scripts. Finally, I created a YouTube channel where I published videos showing all the features of my scripts (this was partially so I didn't have to explain over and over again how they work). And I started waiting for the cash to roll in. Nothing happened for the first two weeks, but then I got my first sale! Someone bought access to one of the scripts for a month. For the first time in my life, I got paid for selling something on the internet. It felt amazing! Later, they requested a refund because they didn't find the script helpful, but to this day, I clearly remember the excitement of laying on the sofa in the evening and getting an email from Gumroad saying, \"Hey, someone just paid you $9 for the thing you've built\". The first sale felt more rewarding than any other that followed, although hitting a $1,000 revenue per month was also a nice milestone. Slowly, more people started using my free scripts, and some also bought the paid ones. To strike while the iron was still hot, I posted a message saying that anyone interested can leave a comment under the paid scripts, and I will give them a free 1-week trial. So people started doing that, and each time, I would log in to TradingView and manually grant them access for a week. Some of those trials turned into paid subscriptions, but most didn't. Slowly but steadily, the number of subscribers started increasing. Needy customers? Checked. Fraud? Checked. Next stop - the \"burn out\" station # As more people used my scripts, I started getting more emails with questions and requests for new features. Many of the emails contained requests for free access to the scripts. Others had very basic questions, answers to which were given in the description of each script. Some people wanted to buy the source code: Or get access to it for free. Of course, for personal use. Sure thing random person from the Internet, I totally trust that you won't share or publish my script as your own. There were people requesting that I add some very specific features because someone they watched on YouTube recommended it. Or that I add some kind of feature that I could not really understand, but it surely made a lot of sense in their mind: Quite a few folks were asking for some \"hot tips\" on how to trade something or if that something was going to go up or down (almost always, this something was cryptocurrencies or forex). Even worse, sometimes such requests were accompanied by a backstory like \"I'm a poor student and want to make some money\" or \"I've lost some money trading, but your script looks very cool, and I will use it to make money back\". Why on earth would you bet your money on some random tool you don't even understand? And then ask some random stranger on the internet for financial advice?! This was sad. I built a tool for people who knew what harmonic patterns were. People who had an investment strategy and only needed a tool to automate the drawing of the charts that they would normally draw by hand. Not some gung-ho investors whose entire investment strategy consists of \"this random script I found five minutes ago says that stock X will go up, so I buy.\" Sometimes, I would get a job offer. Yay! For writing PineScript for a living. Nay! Writing PineScript full time? No, thanks. Or a collaboration proposal from someone who had a \"large group of active traders\": Somehow all those claims from 'people with large communities' never materialized beyond testing the trial. I even had a chance to practice foreign languages! Disputes # Sometimes, people would open a \"dispute\". A dispute means someone complained to PayPal that their credit card was wrongfully charged and then it's up to PayPal to decide if they are right (and refund them the full amount of money + charge me additional $20 for \"chargeback fees\") or if they are not (then I get to keep the payment). In general, I try to be as accommodating to customers as possible. I'm selling software, so unlike with a physical product, I have unlimited stock of my products; producing new copies costs me nothing, and I don't have costs related to handling shipments or returns. So if someone writes to me and asks, \"Hey, I forgot to cancel my subscription, and it renewed for another month\", or \"It's past the 14-day money-back guarantee, but it turns out that the script is not useful for me\", I give them their money back. I want to be nice to people. I started selling those tools to help others. I don't want to charge them for a product they don't like. But I also don't want people to open disputes. If you have too many disputes, you risk that PayPal will freeze your account. Sometimes, being nice to people is not enough. Especially if you don't get a chance to show your goodwill because you're sleeping. My first dispute came from a customer who sent me a message in the middle of the night asking how to cancel their subscription and, half an hour later, proceeded to open a dispute. Even though all they had to do was check the emails from Gumroad that contained a link to manage their subscription. And those are short emails with a few lines of text, so it's not that the link is hidden somewhere - at least other people who wanted to cancel their subscription managed to find it. Or they could at least send me an email without opening a dispute right away. Luckily, after I explained that I could (and wanted to) refund their payment, provided they closed the dispute first, the customer cooperated with me. So we closed the dispute, and shortly afterwards, they got their money back. A few more disputes happened throughout the years but were less thrilling. Usually, someone would open a dispute through PayPal, not answer my messages (or PayPal's), and then PayPal would dismiss that dispute as unfounded. And yes, fraud # Being polite and accommodating will take you a long way and make your online interactions much more enjoyable. It also means that, at some point, someone will try to take advantage of you. For me, it happened three times. Most of the time, someone tried using a stolen credit card, but Gumroad caught that and cancelled the payment. But the first time a fraud happened, it caught me a bit off guard. I don't have many screenshots left because that person deleted their TradingView account, but here's how it went. First, Mr. Scammer (that's not his real name üòâ) asked for free access to the script. That's not uncommon - sometimes, people send me requests like that. When I kindly but firmly denied his request, he tried to pay, but his payment was declined with a message saying he should contact Gumroad. Again, this didn't sound like a red flag, more like a technical issue. Eventually, I got a confirmation email that he had paid for the subscription. Two months later, a \"sale has been disputed\" email dropped. The dispute was initiated by Mr. Scammer. I asked him why he initiated the dispute because he never mentioned wanting to cancel his subscription or getting a refund. This is when things started to be very fishy: Weird grammar errors were not a red flag. They are common in emails I get from existing and potential customers, so it doesn't automatically mean an email is a scam. But a story of your wife controlling the finances and you forgetting to tell her about buying a script for TradingView, which made her open a dispute? That's even weirder than the \"I'm a student who can't afford $15, but I really need this script for my day-trading\" emails I sometimes get. While waiting for the dispute to be resolved, Mr. Scammer tried to buy the subscription one more time, this time with less success: So, was his \"wife\" not only controlling the finances but also using stolen credit cards? I wrote him that he's permanently banned from buying any scripts from me, and the next time he tries, I will immediately revoke his access. That stopped any further attempts. That was the most interesting case of fraud. Usually, when people got caught, they ignored my messages instead of coming up with a creative story: Burn out # Answering emails and checking TradingView comments to give out trial access took a bit of time every day. Not much, but I tried to answer at least every day. It was a minor annoyance when I wasn't working full-time. But when I had to do this after a full day of work, and I got yet another email asking to add some magical method for determining take profit levels that was invented by a crypto-trading YouTuber with 50 followers[1], I had enough. The worst part was that after a few months, I wasn't even using those scripts anymore. I had fun day trading when I wasn't working full-time. It was a nice break from recording videos and a motivation to learn about financial markets. But when a new contract started, I stopped day trading due to the lack of time. But I still had existing customers that I needed to take care of and potential new customers asking me all sorts of questions. I was growing tired of maintaining this project. Sometimes, I would spend an hour answering many detailed questions from a potential customer only to never hear back from them. At times, someone would leave a 1-star review on Gumroad because I didn't want to add some weird functionality they requested. On days like that, I wanted to close down this project, refund the money to the existing clients, and delete my TradingView account. Still, the project was bringing in a bit of money every month. I didn't want to kill the goose that laid tiny golden eggs. So, I've decided that I'm going to sell my \"goose\". Selling my project. Well, trying to... # I looked for platforms where I could list my project for sale. I found a few and decided to submit an ad to IndieMaker and Transferslot (which looked much more active three years ago). I prepared a detailed description of the project and shared details like the number of views on my YouTube channel, unique visitors to the website, the number of followers and subscribers on various platforms, and, of course, the revenue. I even shared some ideas on how to move this project forward. For example, getting one of the free scripts promoted in the weekly TradingView newsletter could accelerate the sales of paid scripts. Then, following some random advice on the internet, I came up with a number to ask for that was around 5x the revenue from last year. I then sent my ad for publication. IndieMaker published my ad, and shortly after, I received an inquiry from a potential buyer. But after answering questions about the Monthly Recurring Revenue growth and what assets come with the project, there was no follow-up. I got more messages later, but those were just spam (\"Hey, I'm interested in your project, send us a list of your inventory\"). Transferslot never published my ad. I think the website was already abandoned when I submitted it. If you have any experience selling projects online (and if you don't, this article from Patrick McKenzie is the best way to understand how it works), you're probably shaking your head by now. People buying software businesses look for simple, low-risk, boring-tech projects with a proven track record of stable or increasing profits. No one wants to buy a project written in an esoteric language (PineScript) running on a proprietary platform (TradingView) that targets a very specific niche of traders. After a couple of weeks with no more replies, I had to decide what to do next. I could submit my ad to bigger platforms like Flippa and pay to have it listed there. But I felt that this project was so niche that I wouldn't find a potential buyer on other platforms either. Especially a potential buyer who knew the PineScript language necessary to maintain and improve the scripts' source code. While waiting for more bids from potential buyers, I started thinking about what I could do to ease the burden of this project. I'm an engineer, goddamit! We're not meant to click buttons in the browser or send the same email over and over again! Turning the autopilot on # I checked my options and decided to automate the following parts of my work: Gumroad payment should automatically grant access to the script on TradingView and send a \"welcome\" email. This would cover the most time-critical part of my work, so I didn't have to start my day from logging in to TradingView and granting access to people who bought subscriptions during the night. A chatbot to manage subscriptions so that I could do all the manual work (removing access from people who cancelled subscriptions, extending trial access, etc.) with simple commands from my phone without logging in to TradingView. Finally, I could create an online form where people could request trial access by leaving their TradingView username. This form would then trigger a Python script granting them one week's access to the selected TradingView script. I implemented all those features using n8n to connect various services together - webhooks, a Telegram bot, Python scripts, sending emails, etc. I will write a separate article describing this setup's technical details. Once I had the automation in place, users could request free trial access through an online form or buy a subscription on Gumroad, and everything would be handled automatically. From time to time, when they cancelled their subscription, I had to send a short message to my Telegram bot to set an expiration date for their access. The hardest part was to stop caring so much about this project and disconnect myself. I like helping people. That's why I became a programmer - to build things that help me or help others. When I get an email, I try to answer it as best as I can. Years of working with clients taught me to explain things in a simple and easy-to-understand way. So, I spent hours patiently answering questions from potential customers only to never hear back from them. And even though I posted a link to the form where people could request trial access, plenty of folks didn't bother reading the description and kept commenting or sending me messages requesting trials. This had to stop. I started by checking TradingView messages only on the weekends and granting trial access in bulk. For every comment about trial access, I replied \"I gave you access now, but it would have been faster if you used the form I posted\", hoping that others would see my reply and use the form next time. I still paid special attention to my existing clients and answered their emails every evening. But if someone was not an existing client, I would only respond to their questions on weekends. Eventually, I stopped checking the TradingView comments or messages. If people really wanted a trial, they would eventually read the two-sentence instruction, click the link, and fill in the form. Did this affect my sales significantly? I don't think so. Most of the people asking basic questions would never convert to paying customers anyway. They were window shopping. They found a script that seemed to predict price changes, and they wanted to know how to make money with it. And the theory behind how it works and why it's supposed to work? Nah, they didn't care. They had ten more random scripts to test out today. Did disconnecting from my project affect my sanity? Oh, hell yes! The project went on autopilot, and it no longer felt like a dreaded chore when I was checking my emails or logging in to my TradingView account. It lost a lot of traction because I stopped updating it, so people think it's not useful anymore (even though it does its job as well as it did a few years ago). Its revenue declined in the past years. But I don't care. I'm happy again. What's next for this project? I guess I will keep running it until I decide that including it in my monthly accounting is not worth the effort, which is when I will shut it down. But for now, the $200 I get every month with almost no work is a nice passive income. Things I've learned # Don't let a side project burn you out # The dreaded truth that most programmers learn the hard way is that releasing a product is just the beginning. Once it's out there, you have to maintain it: fix bugs, implement new features, deal with disputes or frauds, and answer a LOT of emails (often from curious window shoppers who never convert to paying customers). This maintenance is easier if you have more products and you do support in bulk. Or if your project can replace your full-time job and maintaining it is the only thing you do during the day. But if you do this on top of your regular job, it's a terrible time sink. You need to set some boundaries. Otherwise, working on your project will take all your available time. Working on a side project is much more fun if you're also one of its users and genuinely want to keep improving it. It's incredibly smooth if you love your project, and the perspective of working on it full-time sounds like a dream job. And accordingly, it's much harder to support a project when you move on to doing something else and you're no longer interested in maintaining it, but you still have existing customers you need to keep happy. If your side project is not a source of genuine joy and you have other priorities, it's important to set some boundaries. I've decided to focus my support only on the paying customers. I also stopped adding new features and told myself that unless my scripts break, I'm not touching the code. Even though I still had a list of additional improvements I wanted to make one day, I deleted that list. I already had paying customers, which means people find value in what I've built. Sure, I can add new features to attract new customers. But that means even more coding and maintenance for a chance to attract new customers. Use a merchant of record # If you're planning to sell products globally, consider using a \"merchant of record\" like Gumroad or Paddle. This way, you won't have to figure out how much tax to charge for each country (basically, you only sell to Gumroad, and they resell your product to the final customer). Figuring out taxes was the last thing I wanted to do when selling my products. I went with Gumroad, which - at the time of writing - charges a 10% fee, plus around 3% of PayPal/Stripe fees on top of that. There might be cheaper options, so do your research before choosing one. Once you get some recurring payments rolling in, you can't easily move your existing customers to a different company. When the Gumroad fees increased throughout the years, I always thought that migrating to another service was too much of a hassle, so that's why I'm still using Gumroad. Selling stuff to customers is hard # I had this one guy where the conversation looked like this: Hey, amazing script, I rated it 5 stars! Can you implement the take profit levels for me? I'm sorry, but I can't. The original methodology doesn't specify exact take profit levels. It also doesn't make sense because take profits should be manually determined, for example, based on support or resistance levels visible on the chart. Different people will use different take profit levels based on their risk appetite. Ok, but can you please put them for me? I follow this [insert some YouTube crypto day-trader], and he uses [some very specific take profit levels]. I would like the script to draw them for me. Look, I can't do this. Those take profit levels are very specific to your trading system. They won't work for most other people, but they will slow down the script for everyone. Ok, bro. He cancelled his subscription a few days later and lowered his 5-star review to 2 stars. Business-to-consumer (B2C) is difficult (not that business-to-business is much easier - it has a different set of challenges). But this doesn't mean that B2C is not worth pursuing. There are many people who did great selling to customers. One of the most well-known is Pieter Levels (@levelsio), creator of projects like NomadList, RemoteOK, and, more recently, PhotoAI. According to his Twitter profile stats, he makes an astonishing $200k Monthly Recurring Revenue from his projects. But B2C, while easier to get into than establishing a relationship with a company in a B2B business model, means that you will need many more customers to have the revenue levels that B2B can bring. And more customers mean more work. Be nice # Try to be nice to people. I mean, being nice to people in general will make the world a better place. But when dealing with customers, never assume they do something in bad faith. Sure, some folks will try to take advantage of you. But many \"problems\" are just a matter of misunderstanding. People will request a chargeback because they think it's the only way to get a refund for a subscription they forgot about. If someone asks me for a refund, then no matter what's the reason, I give them their money back and wish them good luck with their investments. Fighting disgruntled customers over $20 is not a good way to spend time. If you're nice to people, they are more likely to use and recommend your products. One of the reasons why Amazon got so popular early in the days was because of its extraordinary customer support. Ten years ago, when my Kindle stopped turning on (which might or might not have been caused by accidental yet excessive force applied to it), Amazon's support said \"no worries, we'll send you a new one for free\". Someone would send me a free product instead of requesting to prove that it broke by itself? This blew me away! Especially since I was living in Poland, where the strong post-communism roots mean that if a seller is not mean to you, then this already counts as them being nice.üòâ So, I wanted to do the same with my customers. I tried to accommodate their needs, write detailed explanations to their questions, and generously issue refunds or even discounts when requested. When someone complained that something didn't work because it didn't work the way they wanted, I suggested alternative scripts and offered refunds. And that paid back. I received a lot of nice messages from customers, and even though I was getting tired of supporting my project, getting positive feedback from time to time kept me going for all those years. And that's the story of my first side project. It was fun at the beginning, frustrating in the middle, and now it's mostly a passive income that will eventually dry up. Was it worth the money? Not really. Spending equal time working for a client would probably earn me more. But the experience I gained from this side project will be invaluable when I build the next one. Stay tuned for the next article, where I describe the technical setup I used to automate most of this project. It was always the crypto or forex crowd that was asking for weird stuff. ‚Ü©Ô∏é",

It does get easier over time. I've learnt a few tricks for managing early stage pain points. - You need to develop a polite but curt tone of voice for customer support. - Once your core product is built, its worthwhile spending some time automating the heck out of everything. This will save a TON of time in the near future. - Invest in good docs, even if you're not running a api saas. Good docs + consistent ux + rock solid support will solve most of your support issues. I think a lot of literature around running a online biz has been boiled down to rather basic advice and its hard to find anything solid in this area. I've been running a small blog where I document these issues(operational.co) if anyone wants to check it out. reply guzik 7 minutes agoparent> - Once your core product is built, its worthwhile spending some time automating the heck out of everything. This will save a TON of time in the near future. Interesting. Anything you've automated successfully that you can share? I've heard so many times that you should hold off on automating too early because constant pivoting and refining can end up making you spend more time fixing the automation than actually doing the work itself, so I kinda paused on it. I can see how it would make a big impact on my marketing outreach, which I'm doing manually right now with not much success. reply duxup 3 hours agoparentprev>You need to develop a polite but curt tone of voice for customer support. And very focused responses in terms of action items. You might think of 3 things to say, check, but sadly 90% of the people you respond to with a list will behave like they read just one of them. Sadly this also leads to dragging things out for everyone who can handle more than one thing at a time :( reply Vegenoid 2 hours agorootparentYep. All the time when I worked in IT: Me: Please try these 3 things and let me know how it goes: (list of 3 things with instructions) Them: I tried (thing #1) and it didn‚Äôt work.

Them: (no response) reply zelphirkalt 1 hour agorootparentAnd sometimes the last one becomes: Them: Don‚Äôt close the ticket, I hadn't had a chance to check that yet. Life gets in between and this one library or project is usually hardly the only thing that person juggles. We need to accept, that sometimes issues remain open for an extended duration. The worst is, when you have the same error or issue someone else had already, but their issue got closed by an effin github bot, that automatically closes issues, because someone hasn't replied for a day or two. Like, you are not the center of the other person's life. Just like no one forces you to work at no cost for others and help them, they should not be forced to give undivided focus to your project's issues. Having bots close issues, accompanied by a rude automated message is often contra-productive. It would be fine to instead post a reminder in the issue, asking for an update like shown in the example: Me: Just checking in to see if this is resolved? This is actually a very polite form of handling it. reply ecnahc515 55 minutes agorootparentI almost never see bots close issues that are less than 30 days old. Many projects can change a lot in 30-90 days and the bug may no longer exist, keeping issues open when they may no longer be relevant isn't helping anyone either. If it is still relevant, it can simply be re-opened. I don't see any downside to semi-aggressively closing stale issues. If it's easily reproduced then most good projects will mark it so that it won't be auto-closed. reply wruza 2 hours agorootparentprevI‚Äôm observing this for many years and it feels like there are two types of people. Those who perceive lists as a whole and those who list.shuffle().pop(). Try asking your colleagues/etc three semi-related questions in one message and you‚Äôll get only a partial answer in a significant number of cases. When confronted (constructively, much later) they usually get evasive and can‚Äôt explain. I could theorize it‚Äôs a learned behavior to avoid threaded pedantry or something, but my messages aren‚Äôt even long and other people share my frustration too (we communicate 10x faster and clearer between us).

I also feel that this is happening more and more, since there's more rewards for giving very small pieces of attention and energy to a bigger pool of people, instead giving extra energy or attention to a smaller pool of people seeking for one's help. I'm just facing this with a contractor doing repairs in my house, a month ago was finding a decent mechanic to fix just 2 issues on my car. The first promptly finds energy to discuss things it receives through social networks or messages, but can't provide a decent list of things that I need to provide him to finish his work faster. The second case took a lot of time and discussing with 6 different mechanics, until th car broke and it was towed. I'm seeing this more and more, unfortunately. reply SoftTalker 2 hours agorootparentOr simply their priorities are not your priorities. They have encountered a problem, they asked for help, but they have 10 other things going on. By the time you answer, they have forgotten half the context of the issue.

I have never been at a place in my life where something like \"I will response to all support requests within 48 hours\" is remotely realistic for me.

I would say this would only feel justified if the product pricing page already had clear tiers outlined for paid support. Putting a price per hour on customer support otherwise would make me feel like I am just being milked behind closer doors for more money, and non-paying customers are getting shafted. If a paid customer support tier is something you offer, imo it should be clearly outlined on publicly available pages with explicit explanation about the differences between free vs paid customer support. You suggesting it in private communications only would feel suspicious and shady to me as a customer.

It doesn‚Äôt make sense as an end consumer, but B2B lens it makes sense. If a business can afford the higher price tag, they most likely would rather have a hands off approach for the problem they‚Äôre trying to solve (in a service based business) Many of our mid and lower tier customers want everything drawn out and explained, and give feedback at every step.

The customer support efforts when you don't feel like it, being ghosted after helping a customer, the random or fraud disputes. It's really tricky at that stage between hiring help and having the time/motivation to maintain those very non-tech parts while trying to continue doing other core parts of the side project / startup. The first sale feels great, as does first showing the prototype. By comparison, extra $100 MRR milestones don't feel so great, nor does dealing with customers/disputes eventually (it's a lot of negativity in general - pleased customers just leave reviews occasionally, negative ones email you). And a down negative month or two always feels like a stabbing and like it's all over. Really don't know how to avoid this. Scaling quickly? Via investment in most cases? Maybe. reply federalfarmer 3 hours agoparent> The customer support efforts when you don't feel like it, being ghosted after helping a customer, the random or fraud disputes. These three challenges + context-switching between marketing and product are really tough at the early stage. I've found that growing a business from 0-1 is very formulaic - not easy but the roadmap is clear. Scaling one is much harder, especially without outside capital. There's a huge gulf between earning enough to replace your salary vs. hiring good people to take over lower-level tasks early on. And marketing usually ends up being too critical to outsource at first. At least with digital products, customer disputes can always be settled with refunds, even when the claim is dubious.

One of the things that keeps me away from doing stuff like this is that I _hate_ every part that isn't the engineering part, and the engineering part is a minority share of what it takes to run a business. reply zerkten 3 hours agorootparentWe know the answer to this even before modern tech businesses existed: running a business is a very different experience from what people expect. This is exacerbated with certain experiences that create worldviews which are closer to the opposite of running a business. This is why startup people straight out of school are often unencumbered with ideas that impact their mission. If you go into a large organization, you are exposed to a reality that can distort your perspective. It's a myth that people can't move between large and small organizations, but the differentiator is their awareness of and desire to embrace the current circumstances. Many end up preferring the luxury and ease of large organizations and fail because they don't make the switch. Many startup people don't make the move in the other direction (even if they are exceedingly successful and it might be practical move.) Similarly, a desire to only focus on engineering is something you feel will inhibit your ability to run a business. Over time you might be able to discover ways to reduce your hate for the other work. People here love to prescribe advice for situations like this, but it's really hard to give good advice without knowing a lot more about you. reply Waterluvian 2 hours agorootparentMy solution largely came out of recognizing this reality.

I started out thinking that we've all been conditioned by bad customer support chatbots whose only purpose is to look up facts from the FAQ and then tell you to call the real customer support line to actually handle your problem. the problem was that the chatbots weren't granted hee ability and authority to actually do things. wouldn't it be great if you could aks a bot to cancel your account or change your billing info and it would actually do it? but then i realized... anything with a clearly defined process or workflow like that would be even better if it were just a form on an account settings page. why bother with a chatbot? customer support lines run by humans exist for two reasons: - increase friction for things you don't want your user to do (like cancel their account without first hearing a bunch of sales pitches) - handle unanticipated problems that don't fit into the happy-path you've set up on the settings page My worry is that business dudes will get excited about making chatbots that can do the former and they'll never trust an AI to be able to handle the later. So I'm now of the opinion that having AI customer support will only be used to make things worse. reply QuantumGood 3 hours agorootparentCustomer support isn't paid well, so they often aren't motivated to become very skilled beyond the level of a chatbot before they move on to other things.

The current state of the art does not, so it cannot make decisions. This is why these things can't currently replace real support beyond being a search function exceedingly capable of interpreting natural language queries and, optionally, rephrasing what the found document says to fit onto the query better You can't even have these systems as first line support, verifiying whether the person has searched the docs because you can't trust it with a decision about whether the docs' solutions are exhausted and human escalation is needed. There currently simply needs to be a way to reach a human.

I think I'd rather troubleshoot with a well-scripted AI chatbot, than a human being who's forced into the role of an automaton - executing directly from a script. Just, FFS, let me escalate to an actual competently trained human being once I've been through the troubleshooting. reply crazygringo 4 hours agorootparentprevActually, I do. There's no wait in line. There's no waiting 2 min for each response in chat, or waiting 5 min on hold while the rep figures out what to do. And I've, shockingly, gotten issues resolved faster and better. Using one semi-popular consumer app -- once it pointed me to docs on their site that Google wasn't finding because I didn't know what keywords to use.

Hell, I developed a mobile website once for a power company that was basically a wizard / checklist of \"Have you checked for known outages? Have you checked your breakers? Have you checked if your neighbours have issues too?\" before they were shown the customer service number. Human contact doesn't scale, or is prohibitively expensive. I sat with customer support a while ago (again energy sector, but different company) to observe, and every phone call was at least ten minutes, often 20-30, plus some aftercare in the form of logging the call or sending out a follow-up email. They also did chat at the time, where a chatbot (which wasn't ChatGPT / AI based yet but they're working on it) would do the initial contact, give low-hanging fruit suggestions based on their input, and ask for their information like their address before connecting to a real human. The operator was only allowed to handle two chats at a time, and each chat session took about half an hour - with some ending because the person on the other side idled too long. I mean granted, the UI wasn't great and the customer service guy wasn't a fast typer, but even then it was time-consuming and did not scale. They had two dozen people clocked in, if they were all as fast as this one person, they can handle 50 support calls an hour at most. It does not scale. This was for a company with about 2.5 million users who rarely need customer support. Compare with companies like Google or Facebook that have billion(s) of users.

Or for really common cases (ie. turn it on and off, you're affected by an outage, etc), redirect them to an prerecorded message and then let them know that they are still in the queue and can wait for a person. 9/10 it'll solve everything, but also reduce friction of simple things that might be answered. reply wongarsu 4 hours agorootparentprevMost chatbots are both useless and tedious to interact with.

Whatever the niche, imagine the worst people you've encountered on it, and be sure you want to use your spare time talking to them. Otherwise, the juice is likely not worth the squeeze. reply danenania 3 hours agoparentThat's good advice. Unfortunately though I think the nature of support is that on average it selects for the more difficult people in your customer base, for the same reason that doctors spend a lot of their time with hypochondriacs (despite hypochondriacs making up a small percentage of the population). Something that helps to offset this psychologically, and is also a good thing to do anyway, is to proactively reach out more frequently to all your users. It can be the case that 95% of your users are happily chugging along, while 5% are unhappy and complaining frequently for whatever reason. If you rarely hear from that 95%, it can start to irrationally feel like no one is happy with your product, since that's the message coming from most of your support interactions. reply joshuaturner 3 hours agoprevBefore Reddit changed API access I built an iOS app called Pager (https://pager.app) that allowed users to set up alerts for content posted on Reddit.

Part of the issues also seem to come from a few contributing factors like the unusual platform and expanding from this platform including whatever limitations come with it. Meaning you implemented things in a reverse order than people might otherwise do as they don't start out with a product on a platform trying to make it fit a subscription model. I can imagine the specific type of user base also increasing specific types of annoying support requests. Although customer support almost always ends up being one of the things that at some point will annoy the hell out of you. Even on open source projects, the entitlement can be incredible. Although there you can get away with a remark like \"You are free to uninstall , we will give you a full refund!\". Automating a lot of that certainly was the right call, as well as filtering out all the low hanging fruits of bullshit requests. If people can't be bothered to read instructions (assuming they are clear instructions) then they certainly will also run into various other issues making them not worth the effort. The one thing I don't entirely disagree with is \"Be nice\" which I personally have replaced with \"Be civil\" over the years. It still means listening to peoples requests, helping them where reasonable, even be courteous where applicable. To be fair, there might also be a cultural aspect involved here.

If you make a product for professionals you won't get random chargebacks, incoherent emails, or general rudeness. One great way to filter for professionalism is by simply charging more.

I often get questions from people who can't believe that I'm not jumping at these other opportunities, but I make nearly six figures, my team and bosses trust me, I have nearly unlimited flexibility to choose what I work on and shape my software the way I feel is best, and I get to work full remote and basically make my own hours, giving me all the time I want with my family. It would take an incredible raise to give this up just for better pay. An agony-per-dollar ratio is a perfect way to frame the calculation, and it factors into so many places in life.

For one, people use random sites to test cards to see if they can get away with using stolen CC details at every stripe-integrated company I've seen, target audience irrelevant. The proportion of negative/wild interactions with support and chargebacks is always going to be in an uphill battle with positive correspondance unless you are selling multi-seat deals with support as part of it. I speak a little out of my area of expertise here but from my friends experience, the downside to professional services is that a small proportion of people, or people on bad days, see it as a service, not a SaaS, and will willingly throw threats, insults, etc at you.

I actually had a customer file a class action lawsuit against my business because we sent him a reminder that his subscription was about to expire and if he wanted to renew it he could, and he subsequently filed this lawsuit claiming we were violating a Florida consumer protection law which doesn't allow debt collectors to contact people during certain hours.

I've had a couple of relatively successful B2C products take off as side products in my time, and it is very hard not to develop a personal involvement in the support requests; whereas the detached, time-boxed, semi-automated approach is by far the best way to prevent it from taking over your life. Ultimately you're not a charity (unless you are) and, unless you specify an SLA, you owe these people almost nothing: I tend to suggest offering an automatic refund to anybody dissatisfied for this reason: then invest 95% of your time in whatever makes 95% of the profits. reply shash7 4 hours agoprevVery candid experience - I love it. I've been in a similar boat running a small B2B Saas over the last 2 years.

This will save a TON of time in the near future. - Invest in good docs, even if you're not running a api saas. Good docs + consistent ux + rock solid support will solve most of your support issues.

It might not be the best way to do customer support, and it may feel like you're failing, but you have to protect yourself.

Life can't be kept on pause. Your partner wants a date night, but you have a backlog to work though. You got a frantic email from a customer that they accidentally deleted something and you currently have no way to recover that data. So now you have to add more resiliency to the application. In the middle of the night, your cron server dies, backups stop, emails stop, customers on the other side of the world can't log in. All for a few dollars a day in revenue. Then after a year of that, you get burnt on the project. Then after another year, you stop working on it as much, the bug reports build up until you are scared to even look at your reports. Your partner goes away for the weekend to visit their family, you get a renewed sense of pride in this project that has been limping alone. You fire up your code editor, you pull the last commit down. You start to re-familiarize yourself with the code base. Day 1 was wasted with remembering how you did things. Day 2 starts with a coffee after only sleeping a few hours. You begin to work through the small tasks on your list, because you feel the snowball will work. About 8 hours in, you've made a SERIOUS dent in the backlog. You are feeling good and decide you should eat something finally. Your partner comes home while you are eating your breakfast at 4pm. They start to tell you about their family drama. You start to fade. You walk back to your office and try to get back into the groove. You can't. The weekend is over. Work starts again in 10 hours.

    "title": "MIT leaders describe the experience of not renewing Elsevier contract",
    "originLink": "https://sparcopen.org/our-work/big-deal-knowledge-base/unbundling-profiles/mit-libraries/",
    "originBody": "Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email This is part of a series of profiles detailing the experiences of institutions that have unbundled or canceled big deal journal contracts. The aim of the series is to provide insights, lessons learned, and inspiration to libraries to consider a similar move. Summary MIT leaders describe the experience of not renewing its largest journal contract as overwhelmingly positive. MIT has long tried to avoid vendor lock-in through big deal contracts and, in 2019, maintained individual title-by-title subscriptions to approximately 675 Elsevier titles. In 2020, they took the significant step of canceling the full Elsevier journals contract ‚Äì all 675 titles ‚Äì leaving users with immediate access to only pre-2020 backfile content. Since the cancellation, MIT Libraries estimates annual savings at more than 80% of its original spend. This move saves MIT approximately $2 million each year, and the Libraries provide alternative means of access that fulfills most article requests in minutes. After laying the groundwork with faculty and university administrators, the transition has been relatively seamless with minimal push back from researchers. Most faculty have been supportive of the Libraries in taking a principled stand in line with MIT values and are finding alternative means of access to needed research without an Elsevier subscription. Four years out, the faculty who continue to be most challenged by lack of immediate access are in the life sciences. The experience has highlighted the extraordinary difference between what MIT had been paying (with pricing based on historic spend) to subscribe to Elsevier journal content and what it actually costs the Libraries to provide users with read access to what they need. On the publishing side, MIT‚Äôs analysis demonstrates that there were no financial economies of scale offered by Elseiver‚Äôs read and publish proposal. While local institutional context varies, MIT librarians believe others could likely benefit from a similar move. They are interested in collaborating with others to make collective investments in open publishing using their savings. Preparation In 2019, the MIT Ad Hoc Task Force on Open Access recommended the development of a new framework with value-based principles to serve as the basis for institutional contract negotiations with publishers. The document, formally adopted in May 2020, spelled out the Institute‚Äôs commitment to open access and equity, and provided the Libraries with a critical new tool to use in negotiations. There was a growing belief on campus that MIT‚Äôs history of supporting open learning, open source software, and open scholarship should also be reflected in its relationships with publishers. The new principles-based framework helped to ensure that decisions, such as journal contract negotiations, were firmly anchored in the institution‚Äôs values. This approach also provided concrete touchstones to assist individual authors and faculty in navigating publishing decisions in a similar fashion. ‚ÄúFor MIT to continue to pay millions of dollars to corporations that lock up the scholarship that comes out of our own campus was just inconsistent with MIT‚Äôs history of supporting open education and research,‚Äù said Chris Bourg, Director of Libraries at MIT. The principles were crafted in consultation with the MIT Committee on the Library System, whose members proved to be key in garnering support. A draft of the document was shared in meetings with the councils of MIT‚Äôs five schools. Presentations were given jointly by a Libraries‚Äô representative (typically Bourg or a member of the MIT scholarly communications team) and a faculty member from the committee (often Roger Levy, then-committee chair and a professor of brain and cognitive science). ‚ÄúIt was really important to have those champions among the faculty who could talk peer to peer,‚Äù Bourg said of the work to get campus buy-in for the principles and the changes that could result. Levy was an important example of someone who published in Elsevier journals but was supportive of the Libraries‚Äô potentially canceling its contract with the publisher. In their presentation, the pair explained that canceling contracts with publishers, including Elsevier, who were not willing to adhere to MIT‚Äôs principles was a very real possibility. In addition to answering questions at council meetings, the Libraries presented its principles to the MIT Dean‚Äôs group, which includes the provost and the school and college Deans, who also endorsed the Libraries‚Äô approach. The main questions from faculty centered on how they would be able to continue to access articles if subscriptions were canceled because the publisher was unwilling to meet MIT‚Äôs principles. To help understand the scope of what support would be necessary, MIT used Unsub to determine what proportion of the resources that MIT faculty typically used were already openly available. Bourg and her colleagues were then able to explain to faculty that MIT had perpetual access to back issues, and that newer articles that were not available openly could be obtained quickly and relatively inexpensively through interlibrary borrowing. Many faculty were enthusiastically behind the principles-based approach, said Bourg, while a subset generally agreed with the principles but had concerns about potential changes in access. The year before, the University of California system canceled their Elsevier contract, which signaled MIT would not be alone and helped to allay some concerns at the time. Decision, Outcomes, and Campus Response During negotiations with Elsevier in 2020, MIT presented its principles to the publisher‚Äôs representatives as the basis for new contract negotiations. Once it was clear that the company would not agree to advancing MIT‚Äôs principles outlined in the Framework (such as allowing all authors to retain their copyright), the Libraries made the decision not to renew its contract, effective that July. To support the MIT community once the Libraries went out of contract with Elsevier, scholarly communications librarians created a webpage to guide users through their options for continuing to access articles. For the first several months, the approach focused on providing access through a combination of Interlibrary Loan (ILL) and openly available copies of articles, in addition to conversations with individual faculty about Elsevier‚Äôs business strategy and the MIT Framework. A handful of scholars (especially in the life sciences) expressed concerns about lack of immediate access, Bourg said, and when these concerns persisted, MIT decided to also contract with Reprints Desk, which enables on-demand access for a per-article charge. ‚ÄúTurnaround times were and remain almost instant for nearly all requests,‚Äù Bourg said. Using this combination of non-subscription access strategies, 92% of all articles are delivered to faculty within 1 minute, and 97% within 1 hour. ‚ÄúA lot of universities are hesitant to provide per-article access because of concerns that heavy use could result in costs that would exceed a standard big deal subscription or read and publish deal,‚Äù Bourg said. But that has not been the case at MIT. The Libraries has spent about $300,000 annually for commercial document delivery. ‚ÄúWe spent years building a coalition and getting support from deans, department heads, and provosts, and we had their backup from the start,‚Äù Bourg said. ‚ÄúWhile some scholars remain frustrated by the inconvenience of slightly slower access, we have worked very hard to reduce friction and inconvenience. We do not have any evidence of any decline in the quality of research and teaching at MIT.‚Äù In 2022, Elsevier approached MIT with a request to re-engage in contract discussions. This time, Bourg was joined by an MIT contracts attorney in the negotiation, and once again, the Libraries‚Äô asks were based on the MIT Framework for Publisher Contracts. MIT requested an outlining of the goods and services they would be paying for, some means of using the MIT contract to advance equity in the scholarly communications system, and a contract that allowed all MIT authors (including non-corresponding authors) to have their articles openly available in a repository without an embargo. However, the company returned to MIT with its standard read and publish contract proposal, and MIT once again decided to remain out of contract. MIT librarians continue to collect data about what journals people are requesting and continue to listen to how faculty are adjusting. The Libraries expect that a limited number of MIT scholars may have purchased personal journal subscriptions. Most seem willing to take the small extra step to access an article through document delivery or other access mechanisms in order to stand by MIT values MIT expects to maintain a similar level of savings over time while it remains out of contract. While demand for Reprints Desk may increase somewhat over time (as backfile access satisfies a lower percentage of demand), this need may be significantly offset by the increasing proportion of the literature that is publicly available‚Äîparticularly once the 2022 OSTP Memo comes into full effect. It is also likely that any increased costs for on-demand read access will be less than the annual price increases MIT would have faced had it remained in its journal subscriptions contract. Next Steps and Advice Bourg said she‚Äôs proud of the work that so many people did and the logic senior leaders saw in not paying for content that researchers didn‚Äôt need. The cancellation is part of a broader conversation on campus about the future of scholarly communication that she hopes will continue. Bourg‚Äôs advice for others: ‚ÄúLook at data about use, costs, and find allies across your campus who care about issues of equity and openness,‚Äù Bourg said. ‚ÄúThis is both the right thing to do in terms of our values with public engagement and the right thing to do from an economic point of view.‚Äù As the savings from remaining out of contract with Elsevier continue to accumulate, MIT is interested in collaborating with other libraries to reinvest these funds in community-controlled open publishing initiatives that better serve both their own campus and the academic community more broadly. Bourg notes that ‚ÄúEveryone in the libraries contributed in some way ‚Äì from direct involvement in negotiations, to vendor assessment, technical work, and workflow creation in implementing alternative access, to assisting patrons and answering questions, to gathering and analyzing data, making presentations, scheduling and coordinating meetings, and much much more. This was a true all library effort.‚Äù Note: Those interested in investing funds saved from big deal contracts in open initiatives or in pursuing alternative access strategies to unbundle are invited to join the Strategic Priorities Working Group of SPARC‚Äôs Negotiation Community of Practice.

This conflict goes back a long time. In the early 1990's, with online journals just getting started, MIT was able to insist on principles like \"anyone physically in the library has full access, even if they are not otherwise affiliated with MIT\". A couple of years later, power shifted, and Elsevier could \"our terms, take it or leave it\". Then three decades, a human generation, of Elsevier rent-seeking, and so many people working towards Open Access, unbundling, google scholar, arXiv, sci-hub, and so on. Societal change can be so very slow, nonmonotonic, and profoundly discouraging. And yet here we are, making progress. For anyone unfamiliar with \"author [...] required to relinquish copyright [...] generous reuse rights\", journals would require authors to completely sign over copyright, so authors' subsequent other-than-fair-use usage of fragments would be a copyright violation. Rarely enforced, but legally you'd have to obtain permission. While some institutions sign contracts easily, and struggle with the fallout later, MIT legal culture has been pain-up-front careful with contracts. Which is sometimes painful. But IIRC, we're today using X Windows instead of CMU's Andrew, because MIT could say \"sure!\" while CMU was \"sure, err,... we'll get back to you... some mess to clean up first\". reply hbbio 19 hours agoparent> we're today using X Windows instead of CMU's Andrew And in that world, TypeScript would have to find another name!

You enter commands to your shell in the input window and the results are shown in the same window where they can be scrolled, searched or saved. Typescript does not support curses like xterm does, so you cannot run vi or bash in a typescript, for example. However, you can use the tcsh or pdksh (ksh) shells. Typescript has several other features that I find very useful. The README for the word processing package describes how you can cause the current working directory to be kept in the title of the typescript window. Typescript is \"smart\" about these paths, too. Notice in Figure 4. that the path shown in the title of the window is \"~\", my home directory, and not a fully qualified path. Typescript supports use of several PC keys to make it easier to enter commands. The Cursor-Left and Cursor-Right keys can be used to edit the command I am entering (regardless if my shell supports this). The Home and End keys will move the cursor to the beginning or end of the line (or selected area). The cursor keys are also mapped to allow me to move up and down the the command history. Cursor-Up gets the previous command entered, Cursor-Down the one after. In my opinion an even more useful feature is command completion. If I type \"ls\" and then press Cursor-Up, I get the previous command that began with \"ls\". File completion is supported with the tab key. If I enter \"ls src/tp\" and then press the tab key, typescript will complete the path \"src/tp\" to \"src/tpg-config\" (in my case). It makes entering paths to files ten times easier. I love it! If I enter a command like \"ls /etc\", the window will likely fill and scroll automatically. If I want to see the beginning of the scrolled data, I must use the mouse (or Page-Up/Down keys) to scroll. However, if I enter \"ls /etc control-J\" (where I enter the command with a control-J keystroke, rather than the normal Enter), the command is executed, but the output is pushed to the top of the current window so I do not need to scroll.

Huh? reply lo_zamoyski 5 hours agorootparentprevThe coherent way to think about this is in terms of the common good. In fact, the private good is for the sake of the common good: by being able to have private goods, we are better able to flourish (e.g., by removing conflict over common use). But because the common good is superior to private good, it is not the case that there is an absolute right to the private good. This doesn't mean principles of justice can be violated. On the contrary, it allows for them to be more perfectly realized. If you own a warehouse full of food in the middle of a famine, then it isn't theft for the hungry to take it, because you have a moral obligation to supply the starving with that food. The trouble with the liberal notion of property rights is that it has things exactly backwards. It posits private property as primary, and the common good as a perhaps regrettable, but necessary concession of the private good. But it is the common good that is prior and justifies the private good. So, in this case, does a company like Elsevier serve the common good? reply tivert 4 hours agorootparentYou are exactly right, especially with the example of the famine. Maybe in some cases moderate amounts of greed and selfishness can lead to the common good (though the market), but higher moral principles must always take priority with there's a conflict.

Unless you're in academia, you'd have no idea. I spent a few years in academia while pursuing my Masters. Dropped out for various reasons and never had any idea this was such a huge thing - mainly because as a university student, you just always had access. I got a small glimpse when I got a job a few years later working for a rather large legal publisher and how locked down they kept all of their online materials for anybody outside of academics. Its when I really understood there was a massive war raging about access to this stuff and the publishers trying to eek out every penny from granting access to materials and research that should have been just in the public domain. I didn't stay there long and had almost forgotten about all that stuff until 2011 when it broke into the news cycle again. You're 100% right, this should really be a much larger issue and covered more regularly, it has massive implications on research and copyrights.

I'd hazard a guess that open-access to research affects more than 1% of people directly, and roughly 100% of people indirectly. > state funded research shall be released to the public domain, and all prior contract terms to the contrary are hereby void This phrasing from GP works great because it pushes people's \"freedom\" buttons, and also their \"curb government corruption\" buttons, and for the more academically inclined, appeals to everything from accelerationist futurism to enlightened humanism.

Consistency (in contracts, features, information, behavior) builds. reply mmooss 21 hours agoparentThe effect on experienced negotiators is different: Portraying it as a principle, a policy ('our policy is ...'), an emotional issue, etc. are all just window dressings for what they want, and everyone tries to portray their wants to be as non-negotiable as possible in order to drive up the price they can demand. One basic tactic is to act angry about your want; some politicians love to do this one - it's a new outrage every day. Well I also can act angry and say something or anything is non-negotiable, but the only question is, how much am I willing to give up in order to get that result. Acting angry, saying 'it's our policy' - I don't care about your internal policies; they aren't laws and you can change them at any time; they are your choices just like any other in a negotiation. reply vk5tu 15 hours agorootparentThen this is to misunderstand the customer. Administration in universities is a service to the teaching and research faculties (or departments, names vary). It's these faculties which bring in the money, which produce the results. As a result, universities rarely make decisions like corporations, where the CEO decides and everyone in the organisation toes the line. A policy like this is made by consultation with stakeholders, extensive and ongoing. As the article describes, this takes years even in a small university like MIT. It's simply not within the power of the negotiators to reach a decision outside that policy: they'd be ignored by the university faculties, who would then make their own individual arrangements, and the funds available to the negotiators would not be agreed to (and far worse outcomes are possible, efforts by 'the administration' to make decisions against consensus are a common reason for the head of a university to be sacked). If the negotiators genuinely can't reach agreement, then negotiations have to be suspended, the progress reported to many interested parties within the university, and then a new consensus reached about the negotiation parameters. Now no two universities are the same, and the degree of centralisation varies. But I hope this helps you understand that the 'policy' referred to in this article was itself the result of years of negotiation, and \"you can change them at any time; they are your choices\" doesn't describe the situation. reply elashri 12 hours agorootparentUniversities usually get 40-60% of any grant money by researchers as overhead fees.

The important point in my opinion is that MIT sat together and discussed and also wrote down what they want, how they want it and likely (as an outcome of their discussion) also have an understanding where there are areas to negotiate/compromise on are.

Which is probably correct in 95% of modern business transactions. But surely a skilled negotiator should be able to tell when they're dealing with a party for whom this assumption does not hold. That's one of the main things that being a skilled negotiator is about; the ability to adapt to this particular counterparty in this particular negotiation, instead of adhering to blanket rules. reply TeMPOraL 10 hours agorootparent> modern-capitalism take that reduces to \"People don't actually have principles, they only care about money\"1 This is not a modern-capitalism take, maybe just a modern-capitalism phrasing.

There's no absolute value you won't compromise if the cost of keeping it is high enough, or equivalently, the benefit of breaking it is high enough. Having principles, integrity, is a way to boost the cost of some behaviors ahead of time, so you won't be tempted to engage in them even if presented with substantial rewards. It's particularly effective if other people know your stated principles and will hold you accountable. But it's still a finite threshold that can be overcome (especially with of companies, where principles generally are just pure marketing). A skilled negotiator understands that everyone will sell out on their principles if the reward is big enough - but they also understand that it cuts both ways. Negotiation is a dance of allocating costs and benefits so that everyone actually gets something out of it[2]. It makes little sense otherwise. -- [0] - Absolute principles are like probabilities 0 and 1 in probability theory - they break the math.

They're so intertwined, they can't be separated. The fact that one can always conceive a theoretical \"more valuable thing\" is trivially true, but does not seem practically meaningful.

Which is another issue... copy-editing on scientific papers requires major cooperation between the authors and the editor. reply PopePompus 15 hours agorootparentYes, there was copy-editing. After peer-review and acceptance of the paper, the journal would send me marked up versions of the paper (\"proofs\") that made the paper conform to the journal's style, fixed typos, etc. There were often a couple of iterations concerning these changes. Finally a set of proofs would be accepted, and the paper would be published. Somebody was doing the work of making those proofs, and it wasn't the peer-reviewers. I'm pretty sure that the journals paid people to do that work, and since I was being charged hefty page fees (about $200/page) I suspect some of that money, and perhaps some subscription money, was paying for that work. reply giantg2 18 hours agorootparentprevLower system quality?

The reality is that the power asymmetry is the opposite. What are these large costs for playing what game? Again, this isn't formally controlled by the publishers at all. The snobbery you imagine comes from the promotion and hiring committees and Elsevier and the other publishers aren't on those committees. And you might ask why do the promotion and tenure committees act with such imagined snobbery? They're all experienced academics. It's not like the schools are putting some randos on these committees. It's easily possible for some of these committees to have 300 collective years of experience in the field.

The corporations don't want to pay hundreds of times for the same article, nor do they want to infringe and face legal risks. So they need the brokers to work the system for them.

Could that be replicated by on open source offering? reply mywittyname 22 hours agoparentNetwork effect. \"Everyone\" subscribed to Elsevier, so if you wanted your papers to get visibility and citations, you tried to get it published in their journals. They are a relic of a bygone era. They made sense when journals were physical publications in the library. Elsevier was the one-stop-shop for all of the major academic journals. But with the internet, they make less sense and kept their position through inertia and rent seeking behavior. reply adelmotsjr 21 hours agorootparentI think the issue is more than that though, because if the physical aspect were only the barrier, they should have disappeared by the time the Internet came along. I think (and this is only my honest, outsider perspective) that the issue is, and always was, about trust. As in: who is this dude publishing this paper about high-energy particle physics? I don't know him, so I don't trust him. But I do know about Science, and Nature, and other Journals, so I'm gonna use them. That's why Elsevier and Springer and other publishers continued to exist. Problem is, science isn't about trust. It's about knowledge, and more importantly, truth. But how do get the truth? Well, there's witnesses, and evidence, and Reproducibility‚Ñ¢ of statements to produce facts. Y'know, science itself. If we could somehow resolve the reproducibility crisis of science, I think we would be one step closer to ending the parasitic mono-duo-oligo-whateverpoly of these publishers. Because then it would not be about who I trust to move forward the science enterprise. Instead it would be about facts themselves, and about confirming, via evidence and reproducibility of these facts, that would promote a piece of statement into knowledge. And that is how science should always have been, since the very beginning. But the reproduction of experiments is a problem in itself, that might be the cause of the 'relying-on-trust' issue. Since not all experiments are a simple ./build-and-run.sh script, and some involve a lot of money (think anything in medicine, physics, geology, oceanography, and the list goes on to ‚àû), it ends up being about someone that is reputable and reliable that had money and did the experiment and published in some journal that I know. reply amadeuspagel 7 hours agorootparentA certain trust is necessary even to invest the effort to understand a paper. reply rtpg 18 hours agorootparentprevCuration is, theoretically, a value-add that doesn't magically disappear with the internet. \"This paper is not utter garbage\" is a nice signal, if it's true. reply mitthrowaway2 17 hours agorootparentAnybody can curate.

It could become very prestigious for researchers to be mentioned in your newsletter, and your own reputation will hinge on the quality of the papers you link to (and the ones you leave out). Even so, this service still doesn't require that you host or own copyright to those works!

The fact that that there are so few publishers nowadays really doesn't help with pricing. Another example why antitrust enforcement is needed. reply dan-robertson 20 hours agoparentprevFor institutions, it‚Äôs that Elsevier gives access to some of the papers their researchers need. The question is then how Elsevier got the papers and I think there‚Äôs a bunch of parts to it. Firstly, it can be by providing a good service. Before the war, most papers were published by learned societies and such societies tended to not be very good publishers ‚Äì they would be slow with long backlogs and unable to publish the volume of papers scientists wanted published at the time. By providing a faster service they could get papers. Second it can be by offering a service at all. If you have a Springer journal and an Elsevier journal for some field, they can both get papers because researchers need to publish to advance their careers and one journal will not be big enough for all the papers in that field Third can be from being a preferred choice by being prestigious, which can matter even without impact factor arithmetic ‚Äì hiring committees made of peers can still know which journals in the field are more prestigious / harder to be published in, and take that into account when hiring. It‚Äôs not totally clear to me how to become prestigious. One way is by inertia ‚Äì if you were prestigious before you probably still are. Something some publishers (Pergamon Press, but maybe others too?) did was owning and dining prominent scientists to get them to sign exclusive contracts to edit new journals. Perhaps this association via the editorial board could improve the journal‚Äôs prestige or otherwise get desirable papers in. It does seem true to me that scientific publishers used to provide a pretty valuable service, and I think if one were in a government looking at all the government money going to the journals via universities, one might be able to feel that the improvement to the rate of scientific exchange was worth it. It feels that today, a lot of that value comes from various kinds of inertia/lock-in: Elsevier has the papers and scientists must publish in Elsevier journals to advance their careers, which maintains the prestige of those journals and means the publisher continues to have the papers. reply pdonis 22 hours agoparentprevIt already is: arxiv.org. reply anticensor 22 hours agorootparentDifferent roles. I could have agreed if you said, say, PLOS. arXiv is a preprint repository, Elsevier publishes peer-reviewed journals. reply pdonis 21 hours agorootparentThe preprints on arxiv are read, and responded to, by plenty of peers. The question was what value Elsevier adds; I think the primary value added is just making papers available to anyone who wants to read them. Arxiv does that. (What's more, it does it for everyone, not just academics--as a taxpayer I can go on arxiv and read research that my tax money paid for. I can't do that with Elsevier published journals.) Publication in journals at this point is mainly resume padding and status signaling, not an actual value add. reply anticensor 21 hours agorootparentPLOS is open-access, as a taxpayer you can read world-class peer-reviewed (more stringent than Elsevier journals in fact) articles in your preferred field's preferred issue. reply pdonis 21 hours agorootparentAre there any articles on PLOS that I can't find on arxiv.org? reply j_maffe 19 hours agorootparentIt's not about having access to more articles, it's about the guarantee of peer-review of whatever you read on PLOS.

The current model for traditional publishing vets each paper that is published; arxive vets each author[1] once, and then their papers can be published. So, sure, you could be reading the ramblings of a random person, but it is quite unlikely. I think what is more valuable is looking at the citations to the work you are reading; unless you are reading something very very new, if it is valuable at all it would be cited.

And yet somehow it's not part of the peer reviewing process. reply xhkkffbf 21 hours agoparentprevEditing, typesetting and curating are expensive. Yes, authors can do this and they contribute quite a bit, but it's not enough to support the high quality documents produced by Elsevier. Yes, tex-savvy authors can do a pretty good job but it's just not the same. That's one reason authors choose to pay the page charges. Curating is also surprisingly important. Sure, you can often get some author to send you a free PDF from something written 10-20 years ago. But it's also not uncommon for the author to be very unresponsive. Maybe they left academia. Maybe they're lazy. Who knows? But I know that I can't count on getting a free PDF from any author. reply azan_ 21 hours agorootparentDo you know how expensive open access publications are? I guarantee that editing, typesetting and curating could easily be performed for fraction of that price (and it's easy to prove it - just check how much Elsevier makes each year!).

I'm cts, also known as gf_256, ephemeral, or a number of other handles. I am a hacker and now a small business owner and CEO. In this article, I would like to share my experience walking these two different paths. A hacker is someone who understands how the world works. It's about knowing what happens when you type \"google.com\" and press Enter. It's about knowing how your computer turns on, about memory training, A20, all of that. It's about modern processors, their caches, and their side channels. It's about DSi bootloaders and how the right electromagnetic faults can be used to jailbreak them. And it's about how Spotify and Widevine and AES and SGX work so you can free your music from the shackles of DRM. But being a hacker is so much more than these things. It's about knowing where to find things. Like libgen and Sci-Hub and nyaa. Or where to get into the latest IDA Pro group buy. Or which trackers have what and how to get into them. It's about knowing how to bypass email verification. How to bypass SMS verification. How to bypass that stupid fucking verification where you hold your driver's license up to a webcam (thank you, OBS virtual camera!) Having an actual threat model not just paranoia. Knowing that you're not worth burning a 0day on, but reading indictments to learn from others' mistakes. It's about knowing where to buy estradiol valerate on the internet and how to compound injections. Or the \"bodybuilder method\" to order your own blood tests when your state requires a script to do so. It's about knowing which shipments give the US CBP a bad vibe and which don't. It's about knowing what happens when you open Robinhood and giga long NVDA FDs. I mean the actual market microstructure, not \"Ken Griffin PFOF bad\". Then using that microstructure to find an infinite money glitch (high Sharpe!). It's about knowing how to get extra passports and reading the tax code. It's about knowing how to negotiate your salary (or equity). It's about knowing why things at the supermarket cost what they do. Or how that awful shitcoin keeps pumping. And why that dogshit startup got assigned that insane valuation. And understanding who really pays for it in the end (hint: it's you). My point is, it is not just about computers. It's about understanding how the world works. The world is made up of people. As much as machines keep society running, those machines are programmed by people--people with managers, spouses, and children; with wants, needs, and dreams. And it is about using that knowledge to bring about the change you want to see. That is what being a hacker is all about. --[ 1 - About the Author I have been a hacker for 13 years. Prior to founding Zellic, I helped start a CTF team called perfect blue (lately Blue Water). We later became the number one ranked CTF team in the world. We've played in DEF CON CTF. We've won GoogleCTF, PlaidCTF, and HITCON. It's like that scene from Mr. Robot but not cringe. In 2021, we decided to take that hacker friend circle and form a security firm. It turned out that crypto paid well, so we worked with a lot of crypto clients. In the process, we encountered insane, hilarious, and depressingly sobering bullshit. In this article, I will tell some stories about what that bullshit taught me, so you can benefit from the same lessons as I have. Markets are computers; they compute prices, valuations, and the allocation of resources in our society. Hackers are good at computers. Let's learn more about it. --[ 2 - The Birth of a Shitcoin I can't think of a better example than shitcoins. Let's look at the crypto markets in action. First, let's talk about tokens. What is their purpose? The purpose of a token is to go up. There is no other purpose. Token go up. This is important, remember this point. Now the question is, how do we make the token go up? In crypto, there are two main kinds of token deals. Let's call them the Asian Arrangement and the Western Way. The Asian Arrangement is a fairly straightforward pump and dump. It's a rectangle between the VC, the Market Maker, the Crypto Exchange, and the Token Project Founder. 1. The exchange's job is to list the token, bringing in investors. They get paid in a mix of tokens and cold, hard cash. Their superpower is owning the customer relationships with the retail users, and the naming rights to sports arenas. 2. The market maker provides liquidity so the market looks really healthy and well-traded so it is easy to buy the token. In good deals, they are paid in in-the-money call options on the tokens, so they are incentivized to help the token trade well. Their superpower is having a lot of liquidity to deploy, and people on PagerDuty. 3. The founder's job is to pump the token and shill it on Twitter. They are the hype man, and it's their job to drum up the narrative and pump everyone's bags. Their unique power is they can print more tokens out of thin air, and this is in large part how they get paid in this arrangement. 4. Lastly, the VC gets paid to organize the deal. They give the founders some money, who in return give a pinky promise that they will give the VC a lot of tokens once the tokens actually exist. This is known as a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens, or SAFT. Their superpower is dressing up the founders and project so it seems like the Next Big Thing instead of a Ponzi scheme. Everyone gets paid a ton of token exposure (directly or indirectly), and when it lists, it pumps. Then the insiders dump and leave with a fat stack. Except retail, they end up with the bag. Sometimes the listing doesn't go well for the organizers, in which case, better luck next time. But retail always loses. wtf???

Take for example those Buy Now, Pay Later loans. Now that you are equipped with the concept of capital efficiency, wouldn't it technically better than paying cash to take an interest-free BNPL loan and temporarily stick the freed cash into an investment? (Barring other side effects, etc.) Third, the concept of net present value--i.e., credit--is the killer app of finance. It allows you to transport value from the future into today. Of course, that debt must be repaid in the future, unless you can figure out a way to kick the can down the road forever. For now, let's get back to stocks. ----[ 3.2 - Equities Now we have seen both sides of the coin. Asset value is twofold: speculative and fundamental. First, we saw speculative value as illustrated by crypto meme coins. Then, on the other hand, we examined fundamental value as illustrated by, e.g. a US Treasury. These two lie on two extremes of a spectrum. Some sectors and stocks are more speculative than others; Nvidia is practically a meme coin at this point, whereas something like Coca-Cola is like fixed income for boomers (NFA BTW). Most assets have a blend of both. Thinking about stocks, they (usually) have some fundamental value. Equities represent ownership of some asset, like a business. The business in theory generates dividends for shareholders, and this cash flow (or the net present value of future ones) represents the fundamental value of the business. As we've seen, assets with better cash flows are more valuable. In practice, buybacks can be used to create what is effectively a shareholder dividend in a more tax-advantaged way. Whereas with dividends, they are taxed as income, and this is realized immediately. With buybacks, they are taxed as capital gains, but crucially the gains are not realized until the asset is sold. This could be indefinitely far in the future, so it's more capital efficient. It has the added benefit that it helps pump the token, and imo this is kind of cute because it marries both the fundamental and speculative aspects. Meanwhile, like tokens, stocks are also supposed to go up. Here's an example: imagine a generic meme coin. Apart from Go Up, what does it do? Nothing. Even if it's a Governance Token, who cares when the founders and VCs hold all the voting power? Anyways, I'm describing Airbnb Class A Common Stock. Here's an excerpt from their S-1 [1] [2]: > We have four series of common stock, Class A, Class B, Class C, and > Class H common stock (collectively, our \"common stock\"). The rights of > holders of Class A, Class B, Class C, and Class H common stock are > identical, except voting and conversion rights ... Each share of Class A > common stock is entitled to one vote, each share of Class B common stock > is entitled to 20 votes and is convertible at any time into one share of > Class A common stock ...

Some may because they believe that they will go up, that they will be more dominant, important, and valuable in the future. Like tokens, a large part of stocks' value is speculative. They are expressing their opinion on the future fundamentals. Others may simply because they believe others will believe that it is more valuable. Not fundamentals, this is an opinion about *pumpamentals*. Importantly, unlike fundamental value, speculative value can be created out of thin air. It is minted by *fiat*. Fundamental value is difficult to create, whereas speculative value can be created through hype and psychology alone. ----[ 3.3 - Shareholder Value For stocks, there are usually laws in place to protect investors, pushing the balance between \"speculation\" and \"fundamentals\" towards the latter. As a result, firms are generally legally obligated to act in their shareholders' best interests. This is good because normal people will be able to participate in the wealth generated by companies. And obviously, companies should not defraud their investors. However, the biggest *stake* holders in a business, are usually (in order): 1. The employees. No matter what, no one else is spending 8 hours a day, or ~33% of their total waking lifespan at this place. Whatever it is, I guarantee you the employees feel it the most. 2. The customers. The customers are the reason the business is able to exist in the first place. Non-profits are not exempt: their customers are their donors. 3. The local community / local environment / ecosystem. The business doesn't exist in a vacuum. The business has externalities, and those externalities affect most the immediate surrounding environment. 4. And in last place, the shareholders. They do not really do anything except contribute capital and hold the stock. Of course capital is important but they are not spending 8 hours a day here, they are not the reason the business exists, and in fact they might even live in a totally different country. For large, publicly-listed companies, the shareholders have one more unique difference from the other three stakeholders: liquidity. This difference is critical. Liquidity describes how easy it is to buy and sell an asset. A dollar bill is liquid. Bitcoin is liquid. A house is relatively illiquid. Stock in large, publicly-listed companies is also liquid. A shareholder can buy a stock one day and sell it the next. As a result, the relationship is non-commital and opens the opportunity for short-term thinking. There are many things a company could do which would benefit shareholders short term, while harming the other three stakeholders long term. While a shareholder can simply dump their position and leave, the mess created is left for the employees, customers, and community to clean up. (The SPAC boom was a pretty good example of this. Not all SPACs are bad, but a lot of pretty shit businesses publicly listed through SPACs then crashed. This is sad to me because some of that is early investors and founders dumping on retail like a crypto shitcoin, but dressed up because it's NYSE or NASDAQ. Get liquidity then bail.) Now, it is a misconception that stock companies must solely paperclip- maximize short-term shareholder value. However, this is how it often plays out due to fucked up shit in the public markets, like annoying activist hedge funds or executive compensation tied to stock price. And it is true that employees can be shareholders. And that is usually a good thing! But few public companies are truly employee-owned. Thinking about it from this perspective, the concept of maximizing shareholder value seems somewhat backwards. But *why* would one make this system where the priorities are seemingly inverted? One benefit is that it would make your currency extremely valuable. Suppose you want to do some shit on Ethereum (speculating on some animal token?), you will need to have native ETH to do that transaction. Similarly, if you want to invest in US securities you at some point need US Dollars. If you want to get a piece of that sweet $NVDA action, you need dollars. People want to buy American stocks. American companies perform well: they're innovative; they're not too heavily regulated; it's a business friendly environment. (Shareholder value comes first!) The numbers go up. Remember the token founder from earlier in the Asian Arrangement? Suppose you are a *country* in the situation above, with a valuable currency. Not only is your currency in demand and valuable, you are the issuing/minting authority for that token. Similar to the token founder, you can print valuable money and pay for things with it. And speaking of being a founder, let's talk about that! --[ 4 - Startup Blues Based on what we've set up so far, I will discuss some of the problems I see with many startups today and with startup culture. Much of the problems stem from misalignment between shareholders and the other stakeholders (employees, etc). A lot of this comes from the fundamentals of venture capital. VC is itself an asset class, like fixed income and equities. VCs pitch this to their limited partners, at some level, based on the premise that their VC fund will generate yield for them. The strategy is to identify stuff that will become huge and buy it while it's still small and really cheap. Like trading shitcoins, it's about finding what's going to moon and getting in early. In a typical VC fund, a small handful of the investments will comprise the entire returns of the fund, with all of the other investments being 0's. The distribution is very power law. This means we are not looking for 1x, 2x, or 3x outcomes; these may even be seen as failure modes. We are only interested in 20x, 50x, 100x, etc. outcomes. This is because anything less will be insufficient to make up for all the bad investments that get written down to zero. For the same reason, it only makes sense for VCs to invest in certain types of companies. Have you ever heard this one? \"We invest in SOFTWARE companies!...How is this SCALABLE? What do the VENTURE SCALE OUTCOMES look like here?\" This is because these kinds of companies are the ones with the potential to 100x. They want you to deliver a 100x. Or how about this one? \"We invest in CATEGORY-DEFINING companies\". At least in security, \"category-defining\" means a shiny new checkbox in the compliance / cyber insurance questionnaire. In other words, a new kind of product that people MUST purchase. The market is incentivized to deliver a product that meets the minimum bar to meet that checkbox, while being useless. I invite you to think of your favorite middleware or EDR vendors here. For passionate security founders considering raising venture, remember that this is what your \"success\" is being benchmarked against._.,------------------------------_ .%''&. .;' We partner with founders ^; ! building category-defining ;! ; companies at the earliest stages _; ^;_.^ ''-.______________ __________./ // /^/ /^/;^/' _________ _________ _ '. _ '. ,^ '^_ ,^ '^_ /' '\"' /' '\"' ^' ^\\^ ^' ^\\^ : ^| : ^| : . . |) : . . |) : \\ |) : \\ |) : __\\ ,; : __\\ ,; \" ! ; \" ! ; \" ^\\ _____ /' \" ^\\ _____ /' '|^\\ _/^ '|^\\ _/^^'====='^'====='.|.| _' |^__ _' |^__ ---------_ U '--_ -------------_ U '--_ ----- ._ _. '-._ _. '- ':.' \\ ; / ': .' \\ ; / [4] It's due to the thirst for 100x that there are painful dynamics. A fledgling startup may have founders they really like, but the current business may be unscalable. Bad VCs will push founders towards strategies, bets, models that have a 1% chance of working, but pay out 200x if they do. In the process they destroy a good business--one which has earned the trust of dutiful employees and loyal customers--all for a lottery ticket to build a unicorn. They will throw 100 darts at the dartboard and maybe 5 will land, but what is it like to be the dart? You may have good expected value, but all of that EV is from spikes super far away from the origin. Is it pleasant betting everything on this distribution? VC's want founders to be cult leaders. Have you ever heard this line? \"We invest in great storytellers.\" Like what we saw with stocks and tokens, much of the easily-unlockable potential upside in assets is speculative. In essence, value can be created through narrative. Narrative *IS* value. Bad VC's will push founders to raise more capital at ever higher valuations (higher val = markup = fees), using narrative as fuel for the fire. Storytelling means \"pump the token\", and the job of the CEO is to (1) be the hype man and to raise (2) cash and (3) eyeballs. For this reason, Sam Altman and Elon are fine CEOs, regardless of other factors, because they are great at all three. Much to the detriment of founders' and their employees' psyche, investors expect founders to be this legendary hype man. This requires a religiosity of belief that is borderline delusional. Have you ever tried to convince one of those Silicon Valley YC-type founder/CEOs that they are wrong? They will never listen to you because they have been socialized to be this way. It is what is expected of them, and it is easy to fall into this trap without even becoming aware of it. But if you think about it, does it make sense that to be a business owner, you need to be a religious leader? Of course not. All of these reasons are why so many startup founders are young. They have little to lose, so gambling it all is OK. Being a cult leader may be traumatizing, but they have time (and the neuroplasticity) to heal. And lastly, they do not have the life experience to have a mature personal identity beyond \"I am a startup founder\". All of this makes it easy to accept the external pressures to build a company this or that way. And perhaps not the way they would have wanted to, relying instead on their personal values. The true irony is that the latter is what creates true, enduring company culture and not the made-up Mad Libs-tier Company Culture Notion Page shit that so many startups have. And of course, good VCs are self-aware of all of the issues and strive to prevent them. But the overall problem remains. One last externality is for communities based around an industry. When you add billions of venture dollars into an industry, it becomes cringe. It's saddening to me seeing the state of certain cybersecurity conferences which are now dominated by...\"COME TO OUR BOOTH, YOU CAN BE A HACKER. PLEASE VIEW OUR AI GENERATED GRAPHICS OF FIGURES CLAD IN DARK HOODIES STATIONED BEHIND LAPTOPS\". Here I would use the pensive emoji U+1F614 to describe my feelings about the appropriation of hacker culture but Phrack is 7-bit ASCII, so please have this: :c u_u . _. --[ 5 - Takeaways The point is, all of this made me feel very small and powerless after I realized the sheer size of the problems I was staring at. Nowadays, to me it's about creating good jobs for my friends, helping our customers, and taking care of the community. Importantly, I realized that this is still making a bigger positive impact than what I could have done alone just as an individual hacker or engineer. To me, businesses are economic machines that can create positive (or negative) impact in a consistent, self-sustaining way. There are many people who are talented, kind, and thoughtful but temporarily unlucky. Having a company let me help these friends monetize their abilities and be rewarded fairly for them. And in that way I helped make their life better. Despite a lot of the BS involved in running a business, this is one thing that is very meaningful to me. You can understand computers and science and math as much as you want, but you will not be able to fix the bigger issues by yourself. The systems that run the world are much bigger than what we can break on our laptops and lab benches. But like those familiar systems, if we want to change things for the better, we have to first understand those systems. Knowledge is power. Understanding is the first step towards change. If you do not like the system as it is, then it is your duty to help fix it. Do not swallow blackpills. It's easy to get really cynical and think things are doomed (to AGI apocalypse, to environmental disaster, to techno/autocratic dystopia, whatever). I want to see a world where thoughtful hackers learn these systems and teach each other about them. That generation of hackers will wield that apparatus, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. Creating leverage for yourself. Hackers should not think of themselves as \"oh I am this little guy fighting Big Corporation\" or whatever. This is low agency behavior. Instead become the corporation and RUN IT THE WAY YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE RUN. Keep it private and closely held, so no one can fuck it up. Closely train up successors, so in your absence it will continue to be run in a highly principled way that is aligned with your values and morals. Give employees ownership, as it makes everyone aligned with the machine's long-term success, not just you. Raising capital. Many things do really need capital, but raise in a responsible way that leaves you breathing room and the freedom to operate in ways that are aligned with your values. Never compromise your values or integrity. Stay laser focused on cash flows and sustainability, as these grant you the freedom to do the things right. HACKERS SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO TOUCH THE CAPITAL MARKETS. Many hackers assume \"oh that fundraising stuff is for charismatic business types\". I disagree. It's probably better for the world if good thoughtful hackers raise capital. Giving them leverage to change the world is better than giving that leverage to some psycho founder drinking the Kool-Aid. I deeply respect many of the authors in Phrack 71, and I would trust them to do a better job taking care of things than an amorphous amalgam of angry and greedy shareholders. For all things that don't need capital, do not raise. Stay bootstrapped for as long as possible. REMEMBER THAT VALUATION IS A VANITY METRIC. Moxie Marlinspike wrote on his blog [3] that we are often guilty of always trying to quantify success. But what is success? You can quantify net worth, but can you quantify the good you have brought to others lives? For personal goals, think long term. People tend to overestimate what they can do in 1 year, but underestimate what they can do in 10. DO NOT start a company thinking you can get your hands clean of it in 2-3 years. If you do a good job, you will be stuck with it for 5-10+ years. Therefore, DO NOT start a company until you are sure that is what you want to do with your life, or at least, your twenties/thirties (depending on when you start). A common lament among founders, even successful ones, is: \"Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my twenties\". There's an easy Catch-22 here: you may not know what you really want until you do the company; but once you do the company, you won't really be able to get out of it. Be wary of that. Creating value. This is one of those meaningless phrases that I dislike. Value is what you define it to be. Remember to work on things that have TAMs, but remember that working on art is valuable too! It is not all about the TAM monster--doing cool things that are NOT ECONOMICALLY VALUABLE, but ARTISTICALLY VALUABLE, is equally important. There is not much economic value in a beautiful polyglot file, but it is artistically delightful. This is part of why people hate AI art: it may be economically valuable, but it is often artistically bankrupt. (Some people do use generative tools in actually original and artistic ways, but this is the exception not the norm currently.) Founders vs Investors. Here is my advice: Ignore any pressure from investors to make company \"scalable\" or whatever. Make sure your investors have no ability to fire you or your co-founder(s). Make sure you and co-founder are always solid and trust each other more than investors. You and your cofounders need to be BLOOD BROTHERS (/sisters/w.e). If an investor is trying to play politics with one of you to go against the other cofounder, cut that investor out immediately and stop listening to them. Any investor who pushes for scalability over what you think is the best interest of the company is not aligned with you. High-quality investors will not push for this because they are patient and in it for the long game. If you are patient, you can make a very successful company, even if it is not that scalable. High-quality investors will bet on founders and are committed; only bad ones will push for this kind of shit. I'm going to avoid giving more generic startup advice here. Go read Paul Graham's essays. But remember that any investor's perspective will not be the perspective of you and your employees. Pivoting 5 times in 24 months is not a fun experience to work at: your employees will resign while your investors celebrate your \"coming of age journey\"--unless everyone signed up for that terrifying emotional rollercoaster from the start. They say that \"hacker\" is a dying identity. Co-opted by annoying VC-backed cybersecurity companies that culturally appropriate the identity, the term is getting more polluted and diluted by the day. Meanwhile, computers are getting more secure, and they are rewriting everything in Rust with pointers-as-capability machines and memory tagging. Is it over? I disagree. As long as the hacker *ethos* is alive, regardless of any particular scene, the identity will always exist. However, now is a crucible moment as a diaspora of hackers, young and old, venture out into the world. Calling all hackers: never forget who you are, who you will become, and the mark you leave. --[ 6 - Thanks Greetz (in no particular order): * ret2jazzy, Sirenfal, ajvpot, rose4096, Transfer Learning, samczsun, tjr, claire (aka sport), and psifertex. * perfect blue, Blue Water, DiceGang, Shellphish, and all CTF players. * NotJan, nspace, xenocidewiki, and the members of pinkchan and Secret Club. * Everyone at Zellic, past and present.

I know this is probably a bit revisionist (old-timey inventors wanted to get rich quick too) but it feels like companies used to more often be geared toward longevity, not ascendance, and I don't see how they could achieve longevity while constantly trying to make shareholders rich. Longevity really should be up there on the list of goals, with security and prosperity for all those involved.

The start with security stuff isn't my vibe. But then I kept reading it and the storytelling kept me. The econ stuff, parallels, etc. It ended up capturing perfectly a bunch of ideas I've been having for a few months now. ZIRP was toxic. It made us bad and lazy. Identifying the phenomenons and explaining their mechanisms has been a useful exercise. I think this post will stay in my brain for a long while. I'm at this point in life and this resonates a lot. I want to build useful stuff with intrinsic value and I'm sick of the BS that exulted in the last decade. In my own way I'm trying to start ventures, so it's a good motivating call. Slow start but damn solid article. reply coldpie 5 hours agoparent> ZIRP was toxic. It made us bad and lazy. Yes. It makes me really nervous to see people celebrating the fed talking about lowering rates. Maybe rates should be lowered a bit, sure, I don't know. But please, please don't ever let us go back to zero-interest. As a person who works with technology, that era was so incredibly depressing. So much waste. I'm on the verge of leaving the tech industry because of what happened over the past 10 years. City bus drivers don't have to share an industry with SBF and Juicero and Elon Musk, you know? reply underdeserver 4 hours agorootparentLowering rates is fine. Lowering them to zero is bad. Economists generally believe the baseline, target rate should be around 2-3%. Zero interest rate is like steroids. You can take them for a while to pick you up and help fight a bug (like the 2008 crash), but if you don't stop taking them, you'll need a long, painful, 5.5% interest rate rehab. reply graemep 2 hours agorootparent> Economists generally believe the baseline, target rate should be around 2-3%. The problem with that is (as we found out) that does not leave you much room to cut without going to near zero rates. reply ZoomerCretin 1 hour agorootparentThat's a feature, not a bug. The government reaction to the 2021 economic circumstances was to counter the hot job market, not inflation. It is explicitly and legally the mandate of the federal reserve to target maximum employment first, and 3% inflation if possible. Inflation has been normal for a while now by most metrics, but rates are still sky-high to crush worker power. This may not be the stated goal, but it is the actual outcome we can see. The purpose of a system is what it does. Super-low inflation targets hurt worker negotiating power. reply tiahura 24 minutes agorootparentThe relevant section of the U.S. Code is 12 U.S.C. ¬ß 225a, which states: \"The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy‚Äôs long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" The reason rates are staying high is because of the expectations game. The US had unfathomable price stability for decades. The fed realizes that the inflation genie is out of the bottle. The only way to get it back in is to overcompensate by raising rates and leaving them high until people forget about 10% inflation. reply schmidtleonard 3 hours agorootparentprev> Zero interest rate is like steroids. The problem with your analogy is that paying interest is an active measure. It takes effort. The higher the rate*(outstanding debt), the more effort. This isn't a choice between injecting nothing vs injecting steroids, it's a choice between injecting sedatives vs injecting nothing. Raising the interest rate is like injecting a sedative. How much sedative should we inject? How much sedative can we inject? reply Vegenoid 1 hour agorootparentI disagree, as this implies that an interest of zero is the normal default. Why would it be? Why would someone lend someone else money, when they get nothing for it? reply Jensson 1 hour agorootparentprev> Zero interest rate is like steroids More like adding fat and never burn it. Zero interest means everything stays around, no pressure to produce since there is no expectation of ROI, and then when you suddenly add that pressure a lot of stuff collapses under their own weight since they don't have anything to keep it up. reply sangnoir 29 minutes agorootparentI'll be the devil's advocate. Zero interest rates means it's easier for startups to raise money. High interest rates locks in the status quo - because of their massive war chests big companies don't struggle because of high interests, but small companies do. For individuals in the middle class and lower, high interest rates (and the associated inflation) directly lower the quality of life by eroding their purchasing power. reply wrycoder 4 hours agorootparentprevAnd, if you were to balance the Federal budget, you would inflate away 75% of the national debt in 50 years at 3% inflation. But, only a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution could accomplish that. reply mdorazio 1 hour agorootparentHow are you calculating that? The national debt itself currently has an average interest rate higher than 3%. reply phkahler 5 hours agorootparentprev>> It makes me really nervous to see people celebrating the fed talking about lowering rates. One thing I've often thought true but not confirmed is that lowering interest rates has it's own effect on top of the lower rate itself. Lowering rates leads to refinancing for example which is not a thing in a steady state. I'm inclined to think most of the benefit of a rate lowering is in fact transient, while the effects of having low rates are permanent and there are similarly transient costs with raising rates. It's a trap. reply schmidtleonard 4 hours agorootparentYou talk about low rates like they are a choice. That's mostly not true. A better way to think about it is that low rates are a consequence of \"lots of savings chasing few investment opportunities.\" Sure, the fed can buy and sell treasuries and use its magical balance sheet to push/pull on treasury yields, and these in turn are the lowest risk and most liquid mechanism for duration transformation so they tend to serve as a baseline / comparison point for every other kind of investment, transmitting monetary policy into the real economy. However, the fed's magical balance sheet has limits: if they push or pull on treasury yields too hard for too long, people will stop using them as a default point of comparison and put their money somewhere else. See: Bank of Japan and the JPY Carry Trade that everyone became an expert in about 3 weeks ago. Point is: the fed can push and pull, but it can't fight the market-determined macro and win. Not for long, anyway. Low rates are inevitable between growth sigmoids. Unless you think we can exponentially grow forever, we need to figure out how to cope. What would that look like? How could we possibly cool off the economy without paying people to not invest? Well, I mean, we could raise taxes and spend that on the people who got left behind on the last growth sigmoid, but I can hear the \"boos\" and \"hisses\" already. Hey! Tomatoes are for eating, not throwing! Guys, come on! You know it's true. reply dgfitz 1 hour agorootparent> Well, I mean, we could raise taxes and spend that on the people who got left behind on the last growth sigmoid, but I can hear the \"boos\" and \"hisses\" already. I mostly agree. The issue comes from how the money gets spent. It costs money to collect money, it costs money to spend money. Most of the spent money is used to \"buy solutions\" from private industry, so the rich still get richer, and nothing really changes. Baltimore, MD, USA, spends more per student [1] than almost any other city in the country, and nothing changes. Oh well actually, there is a lot of corruption in the city council and I think over half of the past few mayors have been arrested on criminal charges. [1] https://foxbaltimore.com/news/project-baltimore/in-baltimore... reply toast0 7 minutes agorootparent> Baltimore, MD, USA, spends more per student [1] than almost any other city in the country, and nothing changes. Oh well actually, there is a lot of corruption in the city council and I think over half of the past few mayors have been arrested on criminal charges. I'm not connected to Maryland, but is there a reason, other than history that the school board is appointed by the mayor and not elected? Everywhere I've lived, school districts have been independent from the cities they operate in, and supervised by a state education organization and perhaps mildly supervised by the county board of supervisors in the counties they operate in (or city councils when operating in cities that are counties). Then you could have corrupt city governance without necessarily having corrupt school governance; although you could still have both if that's what your local electorate chooses. reply btown 54 minutes agorootparentprevI have a slightly different view on this. ZIRP allowed companies to do crazy things when it came to tech investment. For instance, would Kafka (and by extension, Confluent, and much of the distributed-systems landscape) exist if LinkedIn hadn't decided: \"you know, let's not think too hard about whether building a custom queue system is fully economically rational, let's just let our engineers do it, and we'll be able to spin it to investors/shareholders as a good use of capital.\" It's no coincidence that this happened in 2010, the first year that the interest rate dropped below 1% (and substantially so). https://www.rtinsights.com/the-technical-evolution-of-apache... https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS Were the people who worked on that project value-optimal for LinkedIn? Maybe, maybe not. Were they \"lazy\" and a \"waste\" in the value they brought to society overall, especially including the spin-offs and startups that members of these teams would go on to build? I don't think that's an accurate characterization. Zero-interest was an effective way to incentivize public companies, VC-backed companies, and their LPs to spend large amounts of money on speculative engineering work - speculative enough that one might even call it research, but the fact that we could call it something other than research is the entire point. It's far from the only such incentive, and it came with many, many downsides, including the creation of many over-funded startups that over-promised and caused harm in their under-delivery. To be sure, startups aren't going anywhere. There are surprisingly fun challenges when profitability and sustainable growth are core requirements for every project, both macro and micro, and it's just an evolution of our hacker mentality to have to deal with these new constraints. But I fear that we've lost the incentive to have companies invest speculatively in crazy projects without having a sufficient replacement for ZIRP, and it may take a generation before we understand how that will have affected the rate of innovative output for the entire world. reply coldpie 26 minutes agorootparentIt's a fair perspective, but I'd counter by bringing up the opportunity cost we spent on the incredible amount of trash startups that ZIRP produced. Those Juicero & crypto & NFT people could've been doing something productive with their lives instead of whatever that mess was. Was Kafka worth that cost? I dunno. But seeing the obvious waste and the clowns who profited from it made me, personally, really depressed at the state of our industry. A system that so blatantly does not distribute rewards for real, valuable work really discourages one from bothering to even try putting in the work. reply dgb23 5 hours agorootparentprevI'm only starting to learn about these things. From the data I've seen and read it seems like low interest rates are (politically) alluring, because of short term metrics, but will bite back via inflation and bubbles bursting very consistently. Is there any wisdom and data that challenges or expands on this that a layman can understand? reply antishatter 4 hours agorootparenthttps://www.amazon.com/Price-Time-Real-Story-Interest/dp/080... reply pas 3 hours agorootparentprevSo, bubbles are hard, especially when the underlying fundamental thing does not respond well to price increases (NIMBYism, zoning, weaponized environmental legislation, etc.) https://www.fullstackeconomics.com/p/the-2000s-housing-bubbl... Tech bubbles are doubly so, because now that \"total addressable market\" has exploded thanks to the internet everything is a bubble. (Starting with the good old dot-com one, and crypto, and AR/VR/Metaverse, and now AI. Folks are comparing Nvidia stock graphs to Cisco around 2000.) .... Likely the HN crowd overestimates the effect of ZIRP on tech, because how crazy the last 10-15 years have been. (But we see that the economy in general performed extremely well, real wages increased, etc.) Yes, of course there were (and are) a lot of scummy ventures, but there will be more. ... Regarding rates, the picture is a bit more complex. So coming out of the 2008 crash the Obama/ARRA fiscal stimulus was too small. (And of course it got hyper-over-politicized on \"both sides\".) And the monetary response was also lackluster. But we also know now (benefit of hindsight!) that the rates before 2008 were too low. https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/monet... One important take-away is that of course everyone wants growth, more growth would help lower taxes, inflate away deficits, yey! Prosperity is good! But ... we can't simply buy growth with endless loans from our future selves. Real economic growth requires increasing productivity, which requires applying new (better, more suited to the situation, more profitable) technologies, which requires changes (duh), but an aging population is very change-averse. The US with the political gridlock tends to go on wild goose chases, spending enormous amounts of money on bullshitting instead of picking better technology. (And here technology includes social technology too. From the things like \"lack of funding reform for fire departments leads to them going with too large firetrucks everywhere to be able to bill a lot, which leads them to not sign-off on thinner roads, which leads to too wide roads where motorists drive too fast, which leads to too many injuries and fatalities\" to all the usual like lack of gun control and bribery rules for the courts.) reply rvense 5 hours agorootparentprevNot a fan of the terminology that corporations are people, but stacks of free money will mess up a company much like it will a person. reply immibis 5 hours agorootparentprevThe long term trend for the Fed is that it raises rates somewhat, and then lowers them even more. There is no reason to think this won't happen again this time, landing squarely in negative rates. It only stops when US dollars are worthless because any Tom, Dick and Harry can get a billion of them for free and even get paid for doing so. So far, the Fed does a good job of gatekeeping normal people out of the negative rate market even when rates are negative - only rich people are allowed to benefit. reply bboygravity 1 hour agorootparentprevElon Musk is very wasteful selling waste due to low interest rates? Please explain or make your point?

We just like to tinker with things. It‚Äôs really not that deep for most of us. reply 0xEF 9 hours agoparentPhrack's tendency toward the edgy sentiment aside, I sort of understand it. Sort of. I grew up in the era of BBSs, microcomputers giving way to full desktops in the US and payphones we're still slightly interesting. though phreaking was sadly in its final days. I also had (and have) severe social anxiety, but had no idea what that was at the time. I just knew I did not understand the world or people much at all, seeing them as sloppy systems that seemed to operate without any predictable set of rules aside from maybe self-preservation and immediate gratification. So when I started taking apart computers, futzing with software and seeing what made the beige boxes tick, I found I could understand those with far more clarity. I also found other people like me in the message boards and a local library. Naturally, this became my world, because I knew how to navigate it better than people who had little interest in using a computer for anything beyond homework or accounting. It really felt like there was this whole reality that sat on top of the \"common\" reality and I had ascended to it with some silly notion of secret knowledge. You can image how addicting that would feel to someone who does not do well social and felt very, very outcast as a kid. I guess the difference between myself and a lot of Phrack authors, whom I still very much respect for laying the paving stones that I got to walk on, is that as I got older, I dealt with my anxiety and found that my genuine curiosity was more of an asset to enriching myself than a key to the door of some secret counter-culture. Hacking, colloquially speaking, went mainstream and sort of left me in the dust, having become impossible for any one person to keep up with the flood of new methods, exploits, etc as the Internet exploded and suddenly everyone had computers in some form or another. I moved on, more or less. Yes, I still tinker, as a hobby and a form of therapy, but mostly with old computers and industrial machines, since that's part of my adult career, but I miss that feeling of being part of some counter-culture-like group, whether it was real or not. I can totally see where it would be hard to let go of that. Heck, I'd post that some of the Phrack authors have no business letting go of it since they helped define that whole world and need to keep it alive. I say let them be edgy. I have trouble with that, myself, but I respect it. Sorry, this turned into a \"Hacker Perspective\" 2600 article, I guess. reply nuancebydefault 7 hours agorootparentI really liked reading your comment. Somewhat related. I used to think, if I get really good at some thing, people will respect or admire me more. So I do my utmost best to be excellent at what I do. I found out that getting respect or admiration works differently. When you are very good in one area, you come across as geeky/nerdy. That fills nicely a respected stereotype in film, where the geek finds the missing piece for saving the world. But in the real world, most people don't care. Also I more recently found out that if you show you are trying really hard, that comes across as feeling very unsure about yourself. So about the article, understanding how the world works. The author clearly has understanding about financial markets. He knows a lot about security weaknesses and how to exploit them. It is all knowledge available on the web after all, if you spend a lot of nights studying it, it starts to click. The world is so much more than that though. For me, it is mostly how you interact with it, and the best interactions are with people. At work, at home, on HN. Why do I work? I make something, I fix a problem, I discuss what is important, it makes somebody happy because it aligns with their goal. Be it a colleague who wants their design reviewed, a customer who has a problem with your product, or a manager who wants a new feature. reply jancsika 3 hours agorootparentprev> I just knew I did not understand the world or people much at all, seeing them as sloppy systems that seemed to operate without any predictable set of rules aside from maybe self-preservation and immediate gratification. That's a fascinating view. In fact, I'd say most FOSS GUIs from the 90s and early 00s make a lot more sense if you see them as having the hidden/bonus goal of repelling this \"world of people.\" I just remember using something like Dynebolic for the first time, (or, much later, Popcorn Time) and having the feeling I'd just found a sparkling piece of amethyst among so many clods of dirt. Hackers always seemed to me way too curious and lazy to shovel dirt in their spare time; basic resentment/elitism toward society so cleanly explain so many parts of FOSS, everything from the amount of time it's taken to get a decent multi-screen configuration GUI to that old error message, \"You don't exist. Go away!\" Digression-- I remember reading an interview of someone who wrote one of the APIs to get multi-screen video working in Linux. They'd written about how they realized that what they'd wrote would be generally useful and therefore needed a GUI. But they didn't have expertise in GUI design nor any interest in maintaining one. So they set down and explicitly wrote a terrible GUI with the goal of making it so bad it'd be less helpful than just using the command line, thus forcing someone else to take on the task of replacing the awful GUI. Does anyone remember what that was? The visual metaphor was something to do with playing cards. Anyhow, I'd love to see that GUI! reply elefanten 9 hours agorootparentprevThoughtful and insightful reflection, thanks for sharing. I think that interplay between personal sense-making, personal strengths and the addictive/rewarding aspects of belonging to a specialized/esoteric community are a very common combination driving the creation of new narratives, new factions/interest and, ultimately, all kinds of change in general‚Ä¶ for better or for worse, usually only time and intervening chance can tell.

It's also used by transgender people as a hormone therapy. A hacker might live in a place where gender-affirming healthcare is illegal or unavailable, or where female reproductive healthcare in general is difficult or expensive to obtain. Reproductive healthcare is much more broadly useful than Molotov cocktails. reply UniverseHacker 5 hours agorootparentprevThis is only an example of the type of thing a hacker would do- a hacker is willing to solve problems on their own on their own even if it requires methods that are illegal, dangerous, or complex.

Unless you are their doctor or are paying for it, your opinion of what medications a person needs is irrelevant- it is absolutely none of your business. This nit-picking is in no way central to my point as it was a general statement about hacker culture ethos not any particular person or medication, so why did you post it? With only two comments so far - It appears you joined HN just to share anti-trans bigotry? That isn't okay. This is not a \"hate forum\" - accepting people that are different is a fundamental aspect of hacker and HN culture. reply UniverseHacker 1 hour agorootparent@awooooo - nonsense, you have people minding their own business and being themselves, and you don't approve so you are insulting them, and trying to say they need to hide who they are or be different. That is just plain old bigotry. Being trans doesn't hurt of affect other women in any way. I'm willing to bet you are different in some way that isn't acceptable to others, so you feel the need to hide it out of fear, or hoping for acceptance. It's true of most people, and the fact that people need to hide themselves is awful.. and what you are contributing to here. I'm not trans but I am neurodivergent in a way that I can't hide, and was bullied and attacked for being different a lot of my life. Bigots that only know of one way people can be different would call me \"queer\" when they cornered me in the school hallway in groups to try to hurt me. Luckily for me, I'm a strong guy, and even being in groups they usually had a worse time of it than I did. I understand what that is like, and don't wish it on anyone.

Because I'm thinking it's maybe more like \"Both queer culture and hacker culture are inherently anti-authoritarian, so they have many points of concordance\". But then I start thinking around the problem, and I think about the amount of privilege inherent in that white-boy-from-the-suburbs 80s/90s hacker thing (\"fifty thou a year'll buy a lot of beer\") and I start to wonder if the gulf is maybe a bit deeper than it first appears.

What the actual fuck?) reply mezzie2 1 hour agorootparentIronically, as a homosexual female, I consider modern queer culture authoritarian as hell. It's really big on there being one way to interpret the world, one way to build/structure your identity, one set of 'correct' opinions, trying to convince you to cut off people who aren't in the Good People Club(TM), etc. This is just enforced via panopticon/mob surveillance rather than a centralized authority. If anything, I'd consider modern (post-Obergefell) queer culture to be pretty hostile to hacker culture since hackerdom is partially about understanding systems and working them to whatever purposes you decide, whereas modern queer culture seems to be about finding a system that works for you and pledging allegiance to it. A lot of my distaste/lack of fitting with queer culture right now stems from the conflicts between the values instilled in me as the child of hackers and the values of queer environments. They were flagged because the comment was deliberately inflammatory and lacked any nuance - there is no way to spring-board from that comment into any kind of continued discussion.

They're not taking a narrow definition of knowledge & extrapolating that once one has that specific knowledge it explains everything. Instead they're broadening the definition of \"hacker\" (& also invoking the idea of continuous interrogation) to describe an approach to always seeking & finding \"how the world works\" in any given context. reply willguest 8 hours agorootparentIt's there three times, which is partly what triggered the comment, as it came across as something of a theme. Certainly this article is less dogmatic that many, but I still got the sense that author was using effects like causes. The less lazy version is to do with treating the metric as the measure. Sure, the quant revolution is in full swing, but it's a terrible way to gauge the success (or failure) of society, and is perhaps a better metric for describing detrimental human activity. That said, I fully appreciate the author's efforts to break with convention, but I felt that the points made actually give creedence to the system that, in my view, is actively corrupting the values that might get us out of this mess reply klntsky 8 hours agoparentprevI don't think the author is guilty of that. reply swiftcoder 8 hours agoparentprevAn effective hacker has to be competent at social engineering as well as having a very deep understanding of software/hardware. By the time you have accrued detailed experience of how both these technical systems and social systems work, you may be well on your way to understanding how the world works (in abstract, at any rate)? reply willguest 8 hours agorootparentI think the term 'social engineering' gets right to the point. We aren't machines but we have found very effective way of hacking our rewards systems so that we can manufacture demand, modify behaviour etc. The author describes the phenomenon, but doesn't seem to see the broader picture. This is where a meta-systematic, or paradigmatic (if you're allergic to the word 'meta') perspective is needed, which transcends both social and technical systems, but appreciated how they fit into a larger scheme. Through this lens the world is decidedly pluralistic and cannot be condensed to 'it's like X, we gotta do Y'. That can work for a personal strategy, and the author is kind enough to make some suggestions, but it's intellectual overreach to try and label the world reply lo_zamoyski 1 hour agorootparent> I think the term 'social engineering' gets right to the point. \"Social engineering\" is just dystopian newspeak for \"deception, manipulation, lying, and bullshitting to get what you want\".

The more exotic of these, which are usually more lucractive and less well regulated, include: derivative-based exchange-traded funds, leveraged ETFs, inverse ETFs, equity-linked notes, credit-linked notes, principal-protected notes, collateralized debt obligations, weather derivatives (yes, you read that right), catastrophe bonds (eesh) barrier options and lookback options, to name a few. They are all mechanisms to leverage expectation and uncertainty and most rely on the quantification of risk at some level. Risk, however, is defined in terms of expected return and subject to an assessment of externalities that is, at its core, resource-blind. reply newzisforsukas 7 hours agoparentprev> given the insane proliferation of valueless derivatives and ejection of human values from these systems might want to clarify a bit there reply eska 4 hours agoparentprevMy point is, it is not just about computers.

Is Aristotle a hacker? Human beings desire, by nature, to know. If you live in a technological society, it is important to understand the thicket of technology we find ourselves in, and how to navigate it. That's just prudence, and just a particular determination of the truth, that it was always good to understand oneself and one's predicament.

The catch22 is that if you are good at technology, you tend to align your personal morals and character to actual true value, not fake value, which makes you a pretty good anti-bullshit filter. However people who align themselves to the concept of making money are more aligned to working with the bullshit, not seeing it as negative but as a part of life. Thats why your ex bosses could build 25M business, and why you are blackpilled. In the past, when there was room for innovation because things haven't been invented yet, you could do both. Now, you basically have to pick one or the other. reply ganzuul 10 hours agoparentprevIf your debt grows faster than your income you are blackpilled.

Like the sibling comment said, 'red pill' is seeing the truth of the world (or, what the community that uses the term red pill thinks is the truth at least. often this refers to the truth as decided by internet mysoginiats). Black pill is this truth + its unchangeable and hopeless and pointless and why do anything and oh god I wish I could go back to not knowing. If its used by somebody reasonable, blackpill is a pejorative with the implication that the ideology is more cynical and hopeless than it really should be and has the connotation that their ideology is a little too internety. reply ganzuul 6 hours agorootparentprevIn the Matrix movie Neo took the blue pill or the red pill. Taking the red pill meant Neo woke up and saw the Matrix for what it was. IRL being \"redpilled\" then started to mean you constructed a new world model which was critical of power structures, which then turned into both misogyny and misandry and pretty soon people realized this world model they created had made them mentally ill. Then the realization that they had constructed a new Matrix, worse than the old, became the 'black pill'. IMO it's different from nihilism because of the self-awareness and inability to stop it from happening. reply gen220 2 hours agorootparentI usually think of \"red pill\" as \"You learn some piece of information, the implications of which lead to your perception of the world expanding in a large and meaningful way that belies your earlier perception of the world and forces a reassessment of prior experiences\". I think of \"black pill\" as a GMO'd red pill designed to nudge the \"learner\" into a position of learned-helplessness. Take a common aphorism around here: \"99% of startups fail, so you shouldn't bother trying\". The red pill is \"failure is the most common modality for new ventures\", but the attached advice makes it a black pill. In a meta way, the linking of the term \"red pill\" to misogyny/misandry turned the red pill concept itself into a black pill (why bother seeking \"red pills\" if the \"community\" most identified with them is so disturbing?). reply jcpham2 8 hours agorootparentprevInteresting thought experiment you‚Äôve shared.

Being on The Semantic Web is easy, and, frankly, well worth the bother Web 3.0 was not about the blockchain, thank god 2024-08-20 by Cal Paterson The Semantic Web is the old Web 3.0. Before \"Web 3.0\" meant crypto-whatnot, it meant \"machine-readable websites\". I thought this concept hadn't really gone anywhere but it turns out that The Semantic Web (best read in a very deep voice) is now very widely adopted. The Semantic Web is so widely adopted in fact that I think it's fair to say that we're already on Web 3.0. It's not the future, it's the present. I suppose that means the blockchain crowd will need to argue their case to get all that crypto stuff into the next major version. Good luck to them, really. If Web 3.0 is already here, where is it, then? Mostly, it's hidden in the markup. JSON-LD for a BlogPosting A worked example might help. Here's how Semantic Web metadata is added for a blog post, for example the one you're reading now. You include a specialelement inside theof an HTML page. Inside that element is some JSON-LD. JSON-LD (JSON \"for Linked Data\") is the leading format for encoding Sematic Web metadata. It's just JSON, really. There are schemas that lay out the \"types\" you can use to describe the stuff on your page. For a blog post, the right type is BlogPosting. Here's a (mildly truncated) example of a BlogPosting: { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\", \"headline\": \"From Shell to Excel - with a little bit of HTTPS\", \"url\": \"https://csvbase.com/blog/10\", \"description\": \"Write once, read everywhere\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Person\", \"name\": \"Cal Paterson\", \"email\": \"cal@calpaterson.com\", \"url\": \"https://calpaterson.com/about.html\" }, \"image\": \"https://csvbase.com/blog-static/excel.png\", \"datePublished\": \"2024-08-12\", \"dateCreated\": \"2024-08-12\", \"dateModified\": \"2024-08-12\" } It's all pretty self expanatory: keys starting with @ are metadata (meta-metadata?) @context is the namespace. Usually it's schema.org @type is the class, BlogPosting the other keys are just things allowed in the BlogPosting type the values of keys can be other types, eg Person for the author key in this case What's in it for me? Does anyone actually read all that stuff? Yes, a lot of bots are out there parsing JSON-LD metadata. Nice things tend to happen to blog posts that include the Semantic Web metadata: Social media sites (Twitter/Discord/Facebook/WhatsApp/etc) start showing that nice link preview with an image for your links. Link previews usually look a bit like this: People do click on these link previews more often than on \"bare urls\", which is something that drives adoption of the Semantic Web. Search engine web crawlers also make use of this metadata both to crawl a bit more intelligently but also to show more information in search results (for example: who the author is). Again, people are more likely to click on such \"enhanced\" search results, which is another thing that has driven adoption. Automated link aggregators show your post to their users. I once woke to many many nice emails from people who normally wouldn't have read my blog. After being initially puzzled I eventually learned that Android had decided, all on its own, to show my blog post on its on-phone news screen. All possible because of Semantic Web metadata. Many other, usually nice, things can happen. The joy of The Semantic Web is that it is permissionless as well as \"vendor-neutral\". Anyone can take the metadata and run with it. That's cool, that's the web spirit. Is it really hard? Not really, no. A bit of JSON, containing things already on the page anyway, just laid out in a way for computers to read. If people can write enormous frontend apps I think they can figure out JSON-LD. JSON-LD for other stuff There are other JSON-LD \"types\" than just BlogPosting. A lot more. Some well supported ones: Event LocalBusiness JobPosting Product Recipe csvbase is a website full of table data (tinder-for-dogs style pitch: \"Github, for data tables\"), so it uses the Dataset type to describe each of tables (for example) in a machine-readable way. Here's an example of the JSON-LD csvbase includes on each table page: { \"@context\": [ \"https://schema.org\", { \"csvw\": \"https://www.w3.org/ns/csvw#\" } ], \"@type\": \"Dataset\", \"name\": \"stock-exchanges\", \"url\": \"https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges\", \"isAccessibleForFree\": true, \"distribution\": [ { \"@type\": \"DataDownload\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges.csv\", \"encodingFormat\": \"text/csv\", \"contentSize\": \"16222\" }, { \"@type\": \"DataDownload\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges.parquet\", \"encodingFormat\": \"application/parquet\", \"contentSize\": \"10751\" }, { \"@type\": \"DataDownload\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges.xlsx\", \"encodingFormat\": \"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet\", \"contentSize\": \"15500\" }, { \"@type\": \"DataDownload\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges.jsonl\", \"encodingFormat\": \"application/x-jsonlines\", \"contentSize\": \"38627\" } ], \"dateCreated\": \"2022-04-25T13:43:24.746075+01:00\", \"dateModified\": \"2023-04-02T20:27:33.255648+01:00\", \"maintainer\": { \"@type\": \"Person\", \"name\": \"meripaterson\", \"url\": \"https://csvbase.com/meripaterson\" }, \"description\": \"The world's stock exchanges...\", \"mainEntity\": { \"@type\": \"csvw:Table\", \"csvw:tableSchema\": { \"csvw:columns\": [ { \"csvw:name\": \"csvbase_row_id\", \"csvw:datatype\": \"integer\" }, { \"csvw:name\": \"Continent\", \"csvw:datatype\": \"string\" }, { \"csvw:name\": \"Country\", \"csvw:datatype\": \"string\" }, { \"csvw:name\": \"Name\", \"csvw:datatype\": \"string\" }, { \"csvw:name\": \"MIC\", \"csvw:datatype\": \"string\" }, { \"csvw:name\": \"Last changed\", \"csvw:datatype\": \"date\" } ] } } } There's a lot of stuff in there. From basic things like the last time the data was changed (personal bugbear of mine) to some more complicated stuff. Several DataDownload objects are included, to help bots understand where people can go to just download the data, without having the visit the site. Hopefully that's nice for people viewing tables through data-specific search engines, like Google's Dataset Search. Save them a click. There's also some more advanced stuff. The JSON-LD document actually includes two schemas. One is the ordinary \"schema.org\" one (Dataset) but the other is a schema called \"CSV on the Web\", which allows you to describe the columns and the types of those columns --- as well as other more detailed data I haven't sorted out yet. I haven't direct evidence that anyone is yet doing much with these CSVW types yet but Google do document that they read it so perhaps there is more to come on this in the future from them. And of course, there is nothing to stop anyone else using it. It's all standardised stuff. It is really necessary? \"Doesn't AI solve this?\" It would of course be possible to sic Chatty-Jeeps on the raw markup and have it extract all of this stuff automatically. But there are some good reasons why not. The first is that large language models (LLMs) routinely get stuff wrong. If you want bots to get it right, provide the metadata to ensure that they do. The second is that requiring an LLM to read the web is throughly disproportionate and exclusionary. Everyone parsing the web would need to be paying for pricy GPU time to parse out the meaning of the web. It would feel bizarre if \"technological progress\" meant that fat GPUs were required for computers to read web pages. Alternatives JSON-LD is not the only form of Semantic Web metadata, though it's increasingly got the most momentum. There is some overlap between the various schemes and many bots will parse whatever they can find. Here's a quick overview of the alternatives: At some point Facebook created the Open Graph Protocol, a standard based on using specialtags. It's widely used and supported but only covers the kinds of things you might post to Facebook: articles, songs, videos, etc. What zoomers call \"Content\". There is also \"microdata\". It's very simple but I think quite hard to parse out. Bits of it are well supported. Twitter published a spec for \"Twitter Cards\" which pretty much just lets you describe how you want your thing to appear on Twitter. It's pretty limited - but Twitter is popular - so this is widely implemented. Before JSON-LD there was a nest of other, more XMLy, standards emitted by the various web steering groups. These actually have very, very deep support in many places (for example in library and archival systems) but on the open web they are not a goer. Boring technology It is surprising how low-key The Semantic Web is. Thousands of sites are already setting this metadata. The Semantic Web is already widespread, it's just that there was no moment of victory. If you think csvbase is cool: become a supporter star the github repo follow me on mastodon write me an email Notes Googlers, if you're reading this, JSON-LD could have the same level of public awareness as RSS if only you could release, and then shut down, some kind of app or service in this area. Please, for the good of the web: consider it. Semantic Web information on websites is a bit of a \"living document\". You tend publish something, then have a look to see what people have parsed (or failed to parse) it and then you try to improve it a bit.

Not in a theoretical universe of decentralized philosopher-computer-scientists but in the dumbed down, swipe-the-next-30sec-video, adtech oligopolized digital landscape of walled gardens. Providing better search metadata is hardly that killer app. Not in 2024. The lack of adoption has, imho, two components. 1. bad luck: the Web got worse, a lot worse. There hasn't been a Wikipedia-like event for many decades. This was not pre-ordained. Bad stuff happens to societies when they don't pay attention. In a parallel universe where the good Web won, the semantic path would have been much more traveled and developed. 2. incompleteness of vision: if you dig to their nuclear core, semantic apps offer things like SPARQL queries and reasoners. Great, these functionalities are both unique and have definite utility but there is a reason (pun) that the excellent Protege project [1] is not the new spreadsheet. The calculus of cognitive cost versus tangible benefit to the average user is not favorable. One thing that is missing are abstractions that will help bridge that divide. Still, if we aspire to a better Web, the semantic web direction (if not current state) is our friend. The original visionaries of the semantic web where not out of their mind, they just did not account for the complex socio-economics of digital technology adoption. [1] https://protege.stanford.edu/ reply glenstein 4 minutes agoparentI am not sure I understand the fixation on a \"killer app\" in the context of web standards. We are talking about things like, say, XML, or SVG or HTTP/2. They can have their rationale and their value simply by serving to enable organic growth of a web ecosystem. I think I agree most with your last sentence and should define success more in those terms, aspiring to a better web. reply recursivedoubts 4 hours agoparentprevThe semantic web has been, in my opinion, a category error. Semantics means meaning and computers/automated systems don't really do meaning very well and certainly don't do intention very well. Mapping the incredible success of The Web onto automated systems hasn't worked because the defining and unique characteristic of The Web is REST and, in particular, the uniform interface of REST. This uniform interface is wasted on non-intentional beings like software (that I'm aware of): https://intercoolerjs.org/2016/05/08/hatoeas-is-for-humans.h...

Hard agree. > Maybe this all changes when AI takes over, but AI seems to do fine without us defining ontologies, etc. I think about it as: - Hypermedia controls were been deemphasized, leading to a ton of workarounds to REST - REST is a perfectly suitable interface for AI Agents, especially to audit for governance - AI is well suited to the task of mapping the web as it exists today to REST - AI is well suited to mapping this layout ontologically The semantic web is less interesting than what is traversable and actionable via REST, which may expose some higher level, reusable structures.

It was funded by port of Rotterdam 10 years ago. Idea was to theorize and build various concepts around discrete data sharing, data discovery, classification, building ontology, query optimizations, automation and similar usecases. I decided not to pursue phd a month into it. I believe in semantic web. The biggest problem is that, due to lack of tooling and ease of use, it take alot of effort and time to see value in building something like that across various parties etc. You dont see the value right away. reply jsdwarf 9 hours agorootparentFunny you bring up logistics and (data) ontologies. I'm a PM at a logistics software company and I'd say the lack of proper ontologies and standardized data exchange formats is the biggest effort driver for integrating 3rd party carrier/delivery services such as DHL, Fedex etc. It starts with the lack of a common terminology. For tool A a \"booking\" might be a reservation e.g. of a dock at a warehouse. For tool B the same word means a movement of goods between two accounts. In terms of data integration things have gotten A LOT worse since EDIFACT is de facto deprecated. Every carrier in the parcel business is cooking their own API, but with insufficient means. I've come across things like Polish endpoint names/error messages or country organisations of big Parcel couriers using different APIs. IMHO the EU has to step in here because integration costs skyrocket. They forced cellphone manufacturers to use USB-Cs for charging, why can't they force carriers to use a common API? reply openrisk 8 hours agorootparentThe EU is doing its part in some domains. There is e.g., the eProcurement ontology [1] that aims to harmonize public procurement data flows.

[1] https://docs.ted.europa.eu/epo-home/index.html reply PaulHoule 4 hours agorootparentprevGood choice. The semantic web really brought me to the brink. The community has its head in the sands about... just about everything. Document databases and SQL are popular because all of the affordances around \"records\". That is, instead of deleting, inserting, and updating facts you get primitives that let you update records in a transaction even if you don't explicitly use transactions. It's very possible to define rules that will cut out a small piece of a graph that defines an individual \"record\" pertaining to some \"subject\" in the world even when blank nodes are in use. I've done it. You would go 3-4 years into your PhD and probably not find it in the literature, not get told about it by your prof, or your other grad students. (boy I went through the phase where I discovered most semantic web academics couldn't write hard SPARQL queries or do anything interesting with OWL) Meanwhile people who take a bootcamp can be productive with SQL in just a few days because SQL was developed long ago to give the run-of-the-mill developer superpowers.

Off the top of head... OpenStreetMap was in 2004. Mastodon and the associated spec-thingy was around 2016. One/two decades is not the same as many decades. Oh, and what about asm.js? Sure, archive.org is many decades old. But suddenly I'm using it to play every retro game under the sun on my browser. And we can try out a lot of FOSS software in the browser without installing things. Didn't someone post a blog to explain X11 where the examples were running a javascript implementation of the X window system? Seems to me the entire web-o-sphere leveled up over the past decade. I mean, it's so good in fact that I can run an LLM clientside in the browser. (Granted, it's probably trained in part on your public musing that the web is worse.)

Often that may require some web scale data, like Pagerank but also any other authority/trust metric where you can say \"this data is probably quality data\". A rather basic example, published/last modified dates. It's well known in SEO circles at least in the recent past that changing them is useful to rank in Google, because Google prefers fresh content. Unless you're Google or have a less than trivial way of measuring page changes, the data may be less than trustworthy. reply lxgr 4 hours agorootparentNot even Google seems to be making use of that capability, if they even have it in the first place.

Microsoft attempted the same with Frontpage, but abandoned it pretty quickly as they always do. I think that Web Browsers need to change what they are. They need to be able to understand content, correlate it, and distribute it. If a Browser sees itself not as a consuming app, but as a _contributing_ and _seeding_ app, it could influence the semantic web pretty quickly, and make it much more awesome. Beaker Browser came pretty close to that idea (but it was abandoned, too). Humans won't give a damn about hand-written semantic code, so you need to make the tools better that produce that code. reply rakoo 7 hours agoparentprevOver on lobste.rs, someone cited another article retracing the history of the Semantic Web: https://twobithistory.org/2018/05/27/semantic-web.html An interesting read in itself, and also points to Cory Doctorow giving seven reasons why the Semantic Web will never work: https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm.

Indeed a good read, thanks for the link! > [Cory Doctorow's] seven insurmountable obstacles I think his context is the narrower \"Web of individuals\" where many of his seven challenges are real (and ongoing). The elephant in the digital room is the \"Web of organizations\", whether that is companies, the public sector, civil society etc. If you revisit his objections in that light they are less true or even relevant. E.g., > People lie Yes. But public companies are increasingly reporting online their audited financials via standards like iXBRL and prescribed taxonomies. Increasingly they need to report environmental impact etc. I mentioned in another comment common EU public procurement ontologies. Think also the millions of education and medical institutions and their online content. In institutional context lies do happen, but at a slightly deeper level :-) > People are lazy This only raises the stakes. As somebody mentioned already, the cost of navigating random API's is high. The reason we still talk about the semantic web despite decades of no-show is precisely the persistent need to overcome this friction. > People are stupid We are who we are individually, but again this ignores the collective intelligence of groups. Besides the hordes of helpless individuals and a handful of \"big techs\"(=the random entities that figured out digital technology ahead of others) there is a vast universe of interests. They are not stupid but there is a learning curve.

Perhaps there is a virtuous cycle to be built where infrastructure that relies on people being more honest helps change the culture to actually be more honest which makes the infrastructure better. You don't wait for people to be nice before you create the gpl, the gpl changes mindsets towards opening up which fosters a better culture for creating more. It's also very important to think in macro systems and societies, as you point out, rather than at the individual level reply PaulHoule 4 hours agorootparentprevOne major problem RDF has is that people hate anything with namespaces. It's a \"freedom is slavery\" kind of thing. People will accept it grudgingly if Google says it will help their search rankings or if you absolutely have to deal with them to code Java but 80% of people will automatically avoid anything if it has namespaces. (See namespaces in XML) Another problem is that it's always ignored the basic requirements of most applications like: 1. Getting the list of authors in a publication as refernces to authority records in the right order (Dublin Core makes the 1970 MARC standard look like something from the Starship Enterprise) 2. Updating a data record reliably and transactionally 3. Efficiently unioning graphs for inference so you can combine a domain database with a few database records relevant to a problem + a schema easily 4. Inference involving arithemtic (Godel warned you about first-order logic plus arithmetic but for boring fields like finance, business, logistics that is the lingua franca, OWL comes across as too heavyweight but completely deficient at the same time and nobody wants to talk about it) things like that. Try to build an application and you have to invent a lot of that stuff. You have the tools to do it and it's not that hard if you understand the math inside and out but if you don't oh boy.

As what you have done is spend many years generating a shared understanding of what that ontology means between the experts. Once that's done you have the much harder task for pushing that shared understanding to the rest of the world. ie the problem isn't defining a tag for a cat - it's having a global share vision of what a cat is.

By that argument we would never have a human language unless everybody spoke the same language. Turns out once you have well developed languages (and you do, because they are useful even when not universal) you can translate between them. Not perfectly, but generally good enough. Developing such linking tools between ontologies would be worthwhile if there are multiple ontologies covering the same domain, provided they are actually used (i.e., there are large datasets for each). Alas, instead of a bottom-up, organic approach people try to solve this with top-down, formal (upper-level) ontologies [1] and Leibnizian dreams of an underlying universality [2], which only adds to the cognitive load.

There was this hand-waving promise in semantic web movement of \"if only we make everything machine-readable, then ..\" magic would happen.

Microformats enabled standardized data markup that lots of applications could consume and understand. RSS and Atom were semantic web formats.

The idea was that if you ran into ingestible semantic content, your browser, a plugin, or another application could use that data in a specialized way. It worked because it was a standardized and portable data layer as opposed to a soup of meaningless HTML tags. There were ideas for a distributed P2P social network built on the semantic web, standardized ways to write articles and blog posts, and much more.

The real question is whether the average publisher is better than an LLM at accurately classifying their content. My guess is, when it comes to categorization and summarization, an LLM is going to handily win. An easy test is: are publishers experts on topics they talk about? The truth of the internet is no, they're not usually. The entire world of SEO hacks, blogspam, etc exists because publishers were the only source of truth that the search engine used to determine meaning and quality, which has created all the sorts of misaligned incentives that we've lived with for the past 25 years. At best there are some things publishers can provide as guidance for an LLM, social card, etc, but it can't be the only truth of the content. Perhaps we will only really reach the promise of 'the semantic web' when we've adequately overcome the principal-agent problem of who gets to define the meaning of things on the web. My sense is that requires classifiers that are controlled by users. reply atoav 11 hours agoparentYet LLMS fail to make these simple but sometimes meaningful differentiation. See for example this case in which a court reporter is described as being all the things he reported about by Copilot: a child molester, a psychatric escapee, a widow cheat. Presumably because his name was in a lot of articles about said things and LLMS simply associate his name with the crimes without making the connection that he could in fact be simply the messenger and not the criminal. If LLMS had the semantic understanding that the name on top/bottom of a news article is the author, it would not have made that mistake. https://www.heise.de/en/news/Copilot-turns-a-court-reporter-... reply npunt 10 hours agorootparentAbsolutely! Today's LLMs can sometimes(/often?) enormously suck and should not be relied upon for critical information. There's a long way to go to make them better, and I'm happy that a lot of people are working on that. Finding meaning in a sea of information is a highly imperfect enterprise regardless of the tech we use. My point though was that the core problem we should be trying to solve is overcoming the fundamental misalignment of incentives between publisher and reader, not whether we can put a better schema together that we hope people adopt intelligently & non-adversarially, because we know that won't happen in practice. I liked what the author wrote but they also didn't really consider this perspective and as such I think they haven't hit upon a fundamental understanding of the problem. reply mandmandam 9 hours agorootparentprevHumans do something very similar, fwiw.

Or even the five stars of linked open data. [1] Sure, JSON-LD is part of it, but it's just a serialization format. The really neat part is when you start considering universal ontologies and linking to resources published on other domains. This is where your data becomes interoperable and reusable. Even better, through linking you can contextualize and enrich your data. Since linked data is all about creating graphs, creating a link in your data, or publishing data under a specific domain are acts that involves concepts like trust, authority, authenticity and so on. All those murky social concepts that define what we consider more or less objective truths. LLM's won't replace the semantic web, nor vice versa. They are complementary to each other. Linked data technologies allow humans to cooperate and evolve domain models with a salience and flexibility which wasn't previously possible behind the walls and moats of discrete digital servers or physical buildings. LLM's work because they are based on large sets of ground truths, but those sets are always limited which makes inferring new knowledge and asserting its truthiness independent from human intervention next to impossible. LLM's may help us to expand linked data graphs, and linked data graphs fashioned by humans may help improve LLM's. Creating a juxtaposition between both? Well, that's basically comparing apples against pears. They are two different things. [1] https://5stardata.info/en/ reply pablomendes 22 minutes agoprevThat statement is both kind of true and, well, revisionist. Originally there was a strong focus on logics, clean comprehensive modeling of the world through large complicated ontologies, and the adoption of super impractical representation languages, etc. It wasn't until rebellious sub-communities went rogue and pushed for pragmatic simplifications that things got any widespread impact at all. So here's to the crazy ones, I guess. reply tsimionescu 12 hours agoprevIf even the semantic web people are declaring victory based on a post title and a picture for better integration with Facebook, then it's clear that Semantic Web as it was envisioned is fully 100% dead and buried. The concept of OWL and the other standards was to annotate the content of pages, that's where the real values lie. Each paragraph the author wrote should have had some metadata about its topic. At the very least, the article metadata was supposed to have included information about the categories of information included in the article. Having a bit of info on the author, title (redundant, as HTML already has a tag for that), picture, and publication date is almost completely irrelevant for the kinds of things Web 3.0 was supposed to be. reply jll29 10 hours agoparentThe blog post does not address why the Semantic Web failed: 1. Trust: How should one know that any data available marked up according to Sematic Web principles can be trusted? This is an even more pressing question when the data is free. Sir Berners-Lee (AKA \"TimBL\") designed the Semantic Web in a way that makes \"trust\" a component, when in truth it is an emergent relation between a well-designed system and its users (my own definition). 2. Lack of Incentives: There is no way to get paid for uploading content that is financially very valuable. I know many financial companies that would like to offer their data in a \"Semantic Web\" form, but they cannot, because they would not get compensated, and their existence depends on selling that data; some even use Semantic Web standards for internal-only sharing. 3.

Everything will be contained in RDF files that anyone can trivially embed and anyone can run queries against the Knowledge Graph to determine anything they want!\" \"We've achieved victory! After over 25 years, if you want to know who wrote a blog post, you can get it from a few sites this way!\" I'd call it damning with faint success, except it really isn't even success. Relative to the promises of \"Semantic Web\" it's simply a failure. And it's not like Semantic Web was overpromised a bit, but there were good ideas there and the reality is perhaps more prosaic but also useful. No, it's just useless. It failed, and LLMs will be the complete death of it. The \"Semantic Web\" is not the idea that the web contains \"semantics\" and someday we'll have access to them. That the web has information on it is not the solution statement, it's the problem statement. The semantic web is the idea that all this information on the web will be organized, by the owners of the information, voluntarily, and correctly, into a big cross-site Knowledge Graph that can be queried by anybody. To the point that visiting Wikipedia behind the scenes would not be a big chunk of formatted text, but a download of \"facts\" embedded in tuples in RDF and the screen you read as a human a rendered result of that, where Wikipedia doesn't just use self-hosted data but could grab \"the Knowledge Graph\" and directly embed other RDF information from the US government or companies or universities. Compare this dream to reality and you can see it doesn't even resemble reality. Nobody was sitting around twenty years ago going \"oh, wow, if we really work at this for 20 years some people might annotate their web blogs with their author and people might be able to write bespoke code to query it, sometimes, if we achieve this it will have all been worth it\". The idea is precisely that such an act would be so mundane as to not be something you would think of calling out, just as I don't wax poetic about thetag in HTML being something that changes the world every day. That it would not be something \"possible\" but that it would be something your browser is automatically doing behind the scenes, along with the other vast amount of RDF-driven stuff it is constantly doing for you all the time. The very fact that someone thinks something so trivial is worth calling out is proof that the idea has utterly failed. reply tsimionescu 54 minutes agorootparentBeautifully said. I'll also add that I wouldn't even call what he's showing \"semantic web\", even in this limited form. I would bet that most of the people who add that metadata to their pages view it instead as \"implenting the nice sharing link API\".

There's zero need. The author (and much of HN?) seems to be unaware that it's not just thousands of websites using JSON-LD, it's millions. For example: install WordPress, install an SEO plugin like Yoast, and boom you're done. Basic JSON-LD will be generated expressing semantic information about all your blog posts, videos etc. It only takes a few lines of code to extend what shows up by default, and other CMSes support this took. SEOs know all about this topic because Google looks for JSON-LD in your document and it makes a significant difference to how your site is presented in search results as well as all those other fancy UI modules that show up on Google.

Someone creative with market pull could easily expand on this e.g. maybe someday a competitor to Google or another Big Tech expands the set of semantic information a bit if it's relevant to their business scenarios.

That's very helpful (although I don't know whether that searching is done over indexed web pages, or on the MLS itself).

Communicating those categories and the cutoff criteria would be an issue in some contexts, but still better if communication is not the goal.

The semantic web as an idea was/is a totally different thing: the idea is the old libraries of Babel/Bibliotheca Universalis by Conrad Gessner (~1545) [1] or the ability to \"narrow\"|\"select\"|\"find\" just \"the small bit of information I want\". Observing that a book it's excellent to develop and share a specific topic, it have some indexes to help directly find specific information but that's not enough, a library of books can't be traversed quick enough to find a very specific bit of information like when John Smith was born and where. The semantic web original idea was the interconnection of every bit of information in a format a machine can travel for a human, so the human can find any specific bit ever written with little to no effort without having to humanly scan pages of moderately related stuff. We never achieve such goal. Some have tried to be more on the machine side, like WikiData, some have pushed to the extreme the library science SGML idea of universal classification not ended to JSON but all are failures because they are not universal nor easy to \"select and assemble specific bit of information\" on human queries. LLMs are a, failed, tentative of achieve such result from another way, their hallucinations and slow formation of a model prove their substantial failure, they SEEMS to succeed for a distracted eye perceiving just the wow effect, but they practically fails. Aside the issue with ALL test done on the metadata side of the spectrum so far is simple: in theory we can all be good citizens and carefully label anything, even classify following Dublin Core at al any single page, in practice very few do so, all the rest do not care, or ignoring the classification at all or badly implemented it, and as a result is like an archive with some missing documents, you'll always have holes in information breaking the credibility/practical usefulness of the tool. Essentially that's why we keep using search engines every day, with classic keyword based matches and some extras around. Words are the common denominator for textual information and the larger slice of our information is textual. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotheca_universalis reply DrScientist 9 hours agoparentThe problem I find with semantic search is first I have to read and understand somebody elses definitions before I can search within the confines of the ontology. The problem I have with ML guided search is the ML takes web average view of what I mean, which sometimes I need to understand and then try and work around if that's wrong. It can become impossible to find stuff off the beaten track. The nice thing about keyword and exact text searching with fast iteration is it's my mental model that is driving the results. However if it's an area I don't know much about there is a chicken and egg problem of knowing which words to use. reply kkfx 8 hours agorootparentPersonally I think the limitation of keyword search it's not in the model per se but in the human langue: we have synonymous witch are relatively easy to handle but we also have gazillion of different way to express the very same concept that simply can't be squeezed in some \"nearby keyword list\". Personally I notes news, importing articles in org-mode, so I have a \"trail\" of the news I think are relevant in a timeline, sometimes I remember I've noted something but I can't find it immediately in my own notes with local full-text search on a very little base compared to the entire web, simply because a title does express something with very different words than another and at the moment of a search I do not think about such possible expression. For casual searches we do not notice, but for some specific searches emerge very clear as a big limitation, however so far LLMs does not solve it, they are even LESS able to extract relevant information, and \"semantic\" classifications does not seems to be effective either, a thing even easier to spot if you use Zotero and tags and really try to use tags to look for something, in the end you'll resort on mere keyword search for anything. That's why IMVHO it's an unsolved so far problem. reply DrScientist 4 hours agorootparentFor me the search problem isn't so much about making sure I get back all potentially relevant hits ( more than I could ever read ) , it's how I get the specific ones I want... So effective search more about excluding than including. Exact phrases or particular keywords are great tools here. Note there is also a difference between finding an answer to a particular question and finding web pages around a particular topic. Perhaps LLM's are more useful for the former - where there is a need to both map the question to an embedding, and summarize the answer - but for the latter I'm not interested in a summary/quick answer, I'm interested in the source material. Sometimes you can combine the two - LLM's for a quick route into the common jargon, which can then be used as keywords. reply matheusmoreira 7 hours agoprevI wish there was a better alternative to JSON-LD.

Since the PS4 is more or less an x86 computer, I imagine most of the hard work would be implementing the system/graphics APIs of the PS4. Or are there major hardware differences between an x86 PC and the PS4 that also need to be handled? reply perching_aix 5 hours agoparentthey must have a shader recompiler infra, because all the shaders are shipped precompiled directly for the platform on consoles. so it's a good bit more than what wine does, at the very least in that regard. reply calebj0seph 4 hours agorootparentVery true. I suppose Wine has to do this as well for Direct3D? reply lxgr 4 hours agorootparentFor PC games and applications, Direct3D shaders are supplied in a high-level shader language (not-so-coincidentally called High-Level Shader Language), given that there is no standard GPU architecture on Windows PCs. Wine does still need to translate that to the target graphics library, as well as all the drawing calls themselves, though. There are also some considerations regarding texture compression, I believe, which is a function usually performed in dedicated GPU hardware, and not all GPUs support all formats. reply FastFT 4 hours agorootparentNot a developer in the field, but I believe generally the HLSL isn‚Äôt packaged in the game. Instead an intermediate format called DXIL is produced at build time from the HLSL, and that‚Äôs what is packaged. reply lxgr 4 hours agorootparentAh, sorry, then I carried over an assumption from OpenGL (where GLSL is actually what's packaged, or at least was a couple of years ago when I last looked at it). In any case, that intermediate representation is probably still easier to compile to hardware-specific code, especially if the hardware has a Direct3D implementation. That's what it's designed for, after all! reply Sesse__ 4 hours agorootparentOpenGL also supports SPIR-V, a similar intermediate format, since 2017 (it came into core in OpenGL 4.6). reply dagmx 4 hours agorootparentprevNo, you can‚Äôt ship precompiled shaders for desktop easily because there‚Äôs no single backend (GPU) to compile for. Everyone ships either shader code or intermediate languages instead. reply dikei 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, that used to be the weakest part of Wine. Luckily, we have DXVK now. reply dagmx 4 hours agorootparentDXVK doesn‚Äôt deal with pre compiled shaders afaik. It needs them in DXIL or HLSL to function. reply compiler-devel 3 hours agoparentprevSee Marcan‚Äôs 2016 CCC talk about the many differences between a ps4 and a pc. https://youtu.be/QMiubC6LdTA reply ultimaweapon 7 hours agoparentprevMost PS4 emulators work in the same way as Wine. reply calebj0seph 6 hours agorootparentMakes sense! Slightly amusing given that originally Wine was a recursive acronym for \"Wine is not an emulator\". reply jerf 4 hours agorootparentWhen one tries to really nail down the exact, precise, 100% accurate definition of \"what an emulator is\", one finds it is like nailing jello to the wall. I've seen several people online discover what the idea of an emulator is, and then they'll say in amazement \"so we could do this and that and the other?\", and the answer, no matter what it is they propose, is \"yes, someone's done that\". Recompile the code entirely into another assembler? Partially do so? JIT it? Ship specific patches for specific content? Emulate gates? Rewrite on the fly? Shim things slightly to change what functions are loaded? All that and more has been done. And even if you draw a sharp line through those things, all the combinations you can think of have also been done, and how will you draw the line through that? I think one of the best ways of thinking about it is that there really isn't any such thing as an emulator. There's just numbers, and they need an interpreter and the ability to reach out to some set of externally-defined functionality, and there is a profound sense in which you have to have some particular hardware manifestation of an interpreter and some functionality to get anywhere, but that particular manifestation is a lot less important than people think. This has only become more true in a world where your CPUs are already not actually executing assembler opcodes anymore, and your OS is already shimmed away from the hardware in another level, and the OS is wrapping your program in yet more abstraction before it even runs a single instruction, which may well include providing a choice of which sets of \"externally-defined functionality\" the numbers can ask for (different Windows subsystems, etc.). Even the \"base system\" has a lot of \"emulators\" in it nowadays. It's emulators almost all the way down! Which suggests that rather than being special, they're actually quite fundamental, and sure, sometimes you need a greater translation layer between this program written with these numbers and this particular chunk of hardware and sometimes you need less, but it's a lot less a distinction of \"kind\" than you might think. This is not the only way to think about it; there are certainly valid perspectives from which \"emulators\" exist, e.g. as a distinct category in a software catalog they're sensible. We all know what that means. But for your own understanding of how the world works, the previous paragraph has a lot to recommend it. reply giancarlostoro 3 hours agorootparentCreate a decompiler for Shockwave so games can be preserved?

Probably won't be 120+ fps once everything is correctly emulated on a \"normal\" machine. Still huge tho reply nodja 7 hours agorootparentIt will be 100+ fps on a current mid-tier system easily, because this is not hardware emulation. Most emulators need to implement/compile a whole different architecture to x86, even if similar to x86 it causes issues because cache gets filled faster, more memory lookups, etc. PS4 doesn't need to emulate almost anything hardware wise, the CPU is a standard x86 and the GPU is a modified radeon. Similar to how wine can get the same or better performance on linux than windows, the ps4 \"emulators\" will achieve performance parity because they're not emulating anything, they're just reimplementing the core PS4 libraries. That said there are some differences in hardware, the big one being the PS4s unified memory, but it shouldn't be much of a problem, there's also the usual shaders need to be recompiled, etc. So it's ok to get hyped for high performing bloodborne gameplay on PC with affordable PCs :) reply BossingAround 10 hours agorootparentprevAmazing.

Either through an official PS5 remaster, an official PC release (less likely) or via some funky unofficial emulation. Even though it's only 30fps the game is quite beautiful for being 9 years old and running on a previous gen console. reply skinpop 8 hours agorootparentit is something to worry about if you care about playing the original. I'm only interested in straight ports with minimal QOL features like 60fps(or unlocked if viable), higher resolution and controller rebinding. I haven't played a single remaster that I preferred to the original game. I'm fine with remasters existing, but only if faithful ports are made available as well. reply pimeys 5 hours agorootparentThe Resident Evil 4 remaster is considered to be much better than the original by almost everybody. Same with the Demon's Souls remaster. reply mmaniac 4 hours agorootparentIt is easy to find criticism of Demon's Souls' remaster's art style by entering that term into your favourite search engine. This isn't \"considered\" true by \"almost everybody\". Regardless of any person's opinion on the changes, being substantially different is enough reason that it isn't a suitable substitute for the original. reply neckro23 4 hours agorootparentprevThose are remakes and not remasters. Different beast. The trouble with remasters is they're usually farmed out to third-party devs who don't always give it the same attention to detail as the original developers. A prime example would be Dark Souls Remastered, which actually makes some of the graphics worse compared to the original PC version. reply mmaniac 4 hours agorootparentThe line between remaster and remake is a blurry one. Nier Replicant ver.1.22... isn't officially called either a remake or a remaster, and a convincing case could be made for either.

Is there a good resource on how you can learn to do this? reply ultimaweapon 10 hours agoparentIt is really depend on the hardware you want to make the emulator. Usually there are 2 kind: 1. Emulate the whole system. 2. Emulate the system API. The first one you write the code to emulate the CPU of target system like OP code interpreter (e.g. NES). The second one you write the code to re-implement the API of the target system (e.g. Wine). For the second one you may need to write a JIT compiler if the target system use a different CPU architecture (e.g. PS3). Most modern console emulator are the later one because how the modern console work is similar to how the PC work. It have an OS kernel and a user-mode libraries for applications. For the latter one there are 2 kind of it. The first one is emulate the user-mode libraries and the second one is re-implement the console kernel and reuse the system libraries from the console itself. reply delta_p_delta_x 9 hours agorootparent> Most modern console emulator are the later one because how the modern console work is similar to how the PC work.

NES / Gameboy / GameGear / similar are probably well-documented, but they will be harder at least because the processors have more opcodes you have to care about. reply badsectoracula 8 hours agorootparentYeah CHIP8 is a simple enough system that i even made two emulators (one in DOS and one in Windows) and an assembler back in 1999-2000 or so when i was in highschool and could barely put eight bits together to form a byte.

No way 0: https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/wodw8x/i_tested_... reply badsectoracula 11 hours agorootparentDepending on how the emulation is done PS4 might have a slightly easier time. AFAICT from some time ago i checked it, PS3 is probably the hardest architecture of all to emulate with RPCS3 basically using LLVM to \"compile\" code fragments from PS3's CPU to native code. I'd expect running x86 code written to run on an AMD APU with a Unix-based OS in another AMD APU with a Unix-based OS to be a bit easier, probably with some VM involved (even Xemu, the original Xbox emulator, is basically a QEMU PC configuration with some Xbox-specific hardware for the GPU and audio). reply Deathmax 11 hours agorootparentprevEmulating a PS3 is significantly harder than emulating a PS4, since on the PS3 you need to convert from the Cell architecture, whereas the PS4 is already x86. reply reedf1 11 hours agorootparentI think this too. My perception of the PS4 is it's just a PC in a box running FreeBSD (or something). I don't think there is any custom architecture at all. Much like a steam deck, which can already run some first party PS4 games just fine (e.g. Death Stranding). Would any emulation even be required? reply dagmx 4 hours agorootparentLots of things are unique about the x86 consoles. They have custom graphics APIs (and semi custom GPUs) which makes graphics translation one of the hardest parts. The graphics systems also assume shared memory which is not a given elsewhere. There are sometimes also some extra CPU instructions if it benefits the console that may not be prevalent, and require some translation. And it‚Äôs even more different when you get to the PS5 era where the systems have some very critical hardware systems like kraken decompression and direct storage which don‚Äôt have super prevalent equivalents. reply p_l 11 hours agorootparentprevMain differences would be hardcoded expectations regarding very tight integration between GPU and CPU, and the available memory bandwidth. PS4 (and PS5, iirc) both use a custom OS built out of FreeBSD with specialized variant of an AMD APU using GDDR memory, plus PS5 got few extra coprocessors for handling things like decompression in line with storage access reply jorvi 10 hours agorootparentSony also did some really weird stuff with the PS4 to make emulation harder, chiefly among them the PCIe ‚Äúglue device‚Äù, a PCIe device that masquerades as one of 15 (?) different ones, depending on the function needed at that instant. Geohotz has a section on it in his presentation about jailbreaking the PS4. reply mmaniac 6 hours agorootparentI can see how that would be difficult for low level emulation, but does it really matter for HLE? Retail games running on the PS4 don't care about the PCIe topology, they just use Sony's function call APIs. reply EPWN3D 1 hour agorootparentThere are various ways they could be made to care, e.g. wrapping a function call in a macro that expands with some sort of assertion about hardware state. But I'm guessing that if they were told to design emulation counter-measures, it was to defeat hardware emulation and not WINE-style library shimming. reply arthurmorgan 9 hours agorootparentprevWhere can the presentation be found?

I suspect emulation will be a long-standing concern. reply KeplerBoy 10 hours agorootparentThat's a different problem.

What it does is re-implement the PS4 libraries and translate PS4 shading language into SPIR-V. reply ammar-DLL 10 hours agorootparentshadPS4 is emulator and fpPS4 is compatibility layer check this wiki for more info : https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/PlayStation_4_e... reply ultimaweapon 9 hours agorootparentThose wiki has some incorrect information. How shadPS4 and fpPS4 works are the same. Almost of them can be categorized as a compatibility layer. The only one that can be called a PS4 emulator is Orbital because it virtualize (and emulate) the PS4 hardwares. reply deelowe 7 hours agoprevI‚Äôm curious. Is emulation development becoming easier these days now that modern consoles are essentially stripped down pc systems. reply ultimaweapon 6 hours agoparentI don't know about the older generation so I'll explain how PS4 emulation can be achieve. The first step is to understand how the console run the game. The good news is the PS4 has been hacked and almost all of its file and information has been decrypted and dumped. The official PS4 SDK also leaked. Now we know how the console run the game. The next step is how to use this information run the game outside the console. The good news is PS4 system is just a modified version of FreeBSD, which mean how it works is very similar to the PC. A PS4 executable is just a custom ELF file. So to run a PS4 game outside the console we need to manually map the game executable and provide the symbol it needed somehow (e.g. a custom implementation or reuse the PS4 library). reply lxgr 4 hours agorootparentWhile that might be true for the CPU side, that description is omitting a ton of complexity on the GPU side this project must be doing. reply EPWN3D 1 hour agoparentprevThe common ISA definitely helps -- it opens the door to just running the game image directly and shoving the right dependencies under it (i.e. what WINE does) rather than having to boot the console's OS. Generally speaking there's been a lot of good work in the industry for binary translation too, cf. Rosetta 2. That's another tool in the box for hoisting a binary on to a different host environment. reply eddieroger 6 hours agoparentprevWe also have better access to others doing the same thing thanks to the Internet, and better and more computing power to figure out how these things work. But I imagine better access to information is a big driver. reply Keyframe 6 hours agoparentprevyes, and when generations share same-ish architecture it goes even faster. reply throwaway918299 7 hours agoprevthe dream of finally being able to play Bloodborne on PC is within reach reply deisteve 2 hours agoparentgran turismo for me on PC online maybe we can play gt2 remastered online reply zombot 8 hours agoprevThis is so cool! How do you get a Mac to read a PS4 game storage medium? reply HideousKojima 6 hours agoparentCan't speak with 100% authority about the PS4 in particular, but for most modern consoles (from roughly the Xbox/PS2/Gamecube generation onward) the easiest way to dump a game disc/cartridge is to have a hacked/modified console that decrypts and dumps the game data for you. reply sergiotapia 4 hours agoprevLatest progress for Bloodborne (what 99% of people are waiting for): This is the dev's youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC6s0avpQRE I wonder what the hell Sony is doing still neglecting, almost vindictively, this S-tier culturally significant game. Are they waiting to use it for a launch PS6 title or what? reply Blot2882 4 hours agoparentAlways enjoyed Sony games. I will not forget that Sony didn't make the PS4 backwards compatible, claiming no one cared about that, and then later offered the ability to play older games via their subscription-based PSNOW service. You can download some of them, but others can only be streamed and you need to have a good internet connection to play a PS2 game. Ridiculous. There will always be a demand for playing older games, hence emulators like this. reply roshankhan28 11 hours agoprevfinally someone did it! i was wondering why we stopped at ps3 emulators, now i can run ps4 games on pc aswell! but would love to know whats holding the devs back. reply jamesgeck0 2 hours agoparentNot sure about PlayStation, but the last two generations of Xbox have been some of the most secure consumer devices available.

OP has none. reply tigeroil 6 hours agorootparentFunnily enough from the way that he talks in his videos I always assumed he wasn't that knowledgeable, until I found out more about him and realised what an incredibly skilled programmer he actually is. I think maybe he just comes off that way because of how he presents things in videos. reply hnlmorg 6 hours agorootparentThe problem with making hard things sound accessible for wider audiences, is that people who understand the hard stuff natively then cannot separate the layman‚Äôs explanation from the technical capabilities of the person making those explanations. Perhaps ironically, over the years I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs those who cannot look past the tech-jargon to be the lesser experienced because they learn the words without fully understanding the concepts. reply serf 5 hours agorootparent>The problem with making hard things sound accessible for wider audiences, is that people who understand the hard stuff natively then cannot separate the layman‚Äôs explanation from the technical capabilities of the person making those explanations. it can also be the case that the 'laymen explanation' is actually patently wrong -- not just over-simplified or 'dumbed-down'; wrong. some things just require a certain level of background knowledge; this is why generally any 'celebrity scientist' explanation of anything with the word 'quantum' in the subject line is generally just down-right wrong. there is no decent metaphor by which to onboard a laymen in certain technical topics. that isn't to say that the 'wrong' answers don't have value in educating the laymen, but the liberties that some experts take in 'wrongness allowance' is quite different from one another. personally I think it's the responsibility of the explainer to step aside at some point and say : \"Look, this is wrong, but without the background this is as close as I can get you to understanding this thing, so just don't take what I say as gospel from this point forward.\" -- the reason this is important is simply due to the fact that the laymen doesn't stand a chance at finding out which parts are wishy-washy by themselves without some further guidance. not mentioning where the fairy tale begins is what leads people into thinking that there is actually an alive/dead cat out there somewhere. they grasp the metaphor itself rather than the statistics concept that is being explored. reply hnlmorg 5 hours agorootparentYou‚Äôre conflating entertainment shows with university lectures. The point of videos like the aforementioned isn‚Äôt to give people a background into game development. It‚Äôs to give people who have no experience an overview for entertainment purposes. reply monoau 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's not true. Science communicators in the past have successfully taught complex theories to a wider audience without compromising in integrity and accuracy. The issue here is that many youtubers have sold factual correctness for a view count. reply hnlmorg 5 hours agorootparentYou say that and I guarantee you that people who have dedicated their career to that particular topic will say those ‚Äúscience communicators‚Äù are technically incorrect due to the generalisations and/or analogies made in the explanation. It‚Äôs such a common behavioural tendency with general audience publications that someone coined a law for it (the name of which I forget but I‚Äôm sure someone else on here can reply with it). reply zztop44 5 hours agorootparentThose people who have dedicated their career to a narrow topic can also be wrong. Not so much about the facts, but in assessing whether or not certain compromises or analogies that don‚Äôt map 1:1 matter for the purposes of what is trying to be communicated. reply hnlmorg 3 hours agorootparentThat‚Äôs exactly the point being made reply valianteffort 8 hours agorootparentprevOdd I've seen multiple videos where he does code, albeit simple examples but still low level C stuff. His video explaining how the original gameboy graphics work is pretty informative imo. I suppose he could just be parroting stuff he has found online but I wouldn't call him clueless. reply mavamaarten 8 hours agorootparentprevNot really. I agree that these days his videos are of mediocre quality and more speculative than based on facts.

For example, further polishing this emulator implementation to be compatible with a larger range of titles and host system configurations.

I know nothing about housing and living expenses in Alaska, but I'd guess that isn't exactly enough to make work completely optional. reply dfxm12 4 hours agorootparentYes, absolutely. It sounds like you're conflating a few things. UBI is as it says, an income that is given universally. UBI doesn't imply a certain amount of income. Other phrases may be used for what you seem to be describing: full basic income, guaranteed minimum income (which implies means testing). reply lxgr 4 hours agorootparentUnder that definition, $1/year/person would still \"qualify\" as UBI, and I don't think there are many interesting conversations to be had around that. reply dfxm12 4 hours agorootparentThis is why I'm glad in practice politicians, economists, etc., tend to study these things in order figure out how to structure social services in a way that actually helps people and not to make \"Reductio ad absurdum\" style arguments. reply Matticus_Rex 5 hours agoparentprevBad news about the frequency of this trait reply commodoreboxer 5 hours agorootparentWhat is the frequency? I haven't read much on it. Honestly, I'm not sure the frequency needs to be extraordinarily high.

Making and distributing things like emulators seems to be OK legally. I'm pretty sure this was tested in court via Sony's lawsuits against Bleem, but I understand there are always finer points that may not be apparent.

Is it perfect? No, probably not. But repealing it would likely increase the budget deficit according to the CBO and put a large number of folks into a much worse situation than they are in now. reply analog31 16 hours agorootparentIndeed, at the time it was widely understood that Obamacare was about access, not cost. This was a necessary compromise in order to placate the insurance industry. The battle over cost was left for another day. reply pton_xd 15 hours agorootparentprevOn the one hand, yeah of course guaranteeing coverage for children and preexisting conditions is an obvious win. And removing coverage caps. But beyond that... has average life expectancy measurably increased because of this \"extra\" insurance coverage? Has the number of medical-related bankruptcies measurably decreased as a result of the expanded coverage? I can't find solid data but everything I've seen suggests that those haven't really changed at all. Given that, in the grand scheme of things, has anything actually improved for us, collectively? Healthcare is much more expensive now, but maybe that would have happened regardless. reply Tostino 14 hours agorootparentI saw this in the thread elsewhere, but it was a great point, so I'll repeat it: https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Figure-1-12.p...

Artificially limiting the ability of new participants to enter the market on the supply side, for example, creates an artificially-oligopolistic environment without the natural competitive pressures that force pricing down. Even worse, this in turn results in an environment that attracts people and organizations who want to exploit these government-created inefficiencies for personal profit, rather than attracting people and organizations who want to provide higher-quality and lower-cost service than their competitors. The end result of this government intervention is artificially-high costs for abysmal service. The situation only gets worse when government tries to intervene with even more \"solutions\" for the problems that government itself created in the first place. reply rapidaneurism 12 hours agorootparentprevNot my Circus, as I get European 'free' coverage: is this reflected in excess death data? reply Cody-99 16 hours agorootparentprevIt is objectively a success lol.

But each business doesn't exist in an a vacuum, but inhabits the same environment for getting workers. By making it easier to start new companies, and to compete, by banning non competes, the surviving business might actually be more profitable than the ones before.

If they did have to pay, it could definitely be advantageous to pay employees not to leave, on a selective basis. reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparentprev> The less labour rights a country has, the more competitive a country's businesses are. If you can keep your workers in quasi-indentured servitude, you're going to be more profitable than a business that can't. The first statement is largely true, the second statement is not. Somebody has to buy the stuff you make. At the level of an individual company this isn't a thing -- Ford isn't really going to sell a big percentage of its cars to its own employees -- but at the national level it is, because Ford does sell a substantial percentage of its cars to Americans. And it's easier for companies to sell domestically than internationally because domestic customers will favor them and foreign governments use protectionism to varying degrees. The reason that most \"labor rights\" make companies uncompetitive is that they're inefficient. Requiring companies to provide specific benefits, rather than money with which employees can buy whatever they want, lowers real compensation because wages adjust to compensate (typically by rising slower than global GDP) and then you're stuck with whatever version of the benefit the employer provides instead of having the option to take the money instead and being able to choose yourself in a competitive market. Which raises the company's costs relative to their perceived attractiveness to workers. Unions for structural reasons typically prioritize things like seniority rules that aren't to the benefit of all their members (namely the newest ones) and in turn make it hard for the company to attract new talents who don't want to wait 30 years to get the salary a foreign competitor can offer today. This is why, when given the choice between higher pay and some other employer-provided benefit, people typically take the money. But the rules get passed because they're sold as a free lunch, and then industries decline there because they're not. Non-competes are the opposite because they have a similar effect on the industry as a whole as do the inefficient labor rules, i.e. they increase the costs of other companies in the same jurisdiction. John was working for company A and wants to work for company B, but isn't allowed to, so company B have to hire Chris, who isn't as good -- otherwise company B would have hired him to begin with. It hurts the workers and every company except for company A. Then company A (or as a group, large incumbents) go to the government to lobby to let them do this even though it hurts the industry and country as a whole. In general, anti-trust rules improve the competitiveness of a country's industries, because they improve the competitive fitness of its companies and allow them to survive when new foreign competitors come who would eat the lunch of a wasteful bureaucratic incumbent that isn't accustomed to competitive pressure but can't touch a hundred nimble entrepreneurs who are already doing what it takes to win the customer's business in the face of stiff competition.

A broad non-compete in a contracting agreement (especially, as another commenter noted, the ridiculousness of 10! years) is absurd, so you should always ask to have it removed. The whole point of contracting agreements is flexibility on both sides - it's insane for a company to want the flexibility in how they hire you but want you to have all the responsibilities of of being a full time employee (not like I think non-competes for FTEs should be enforceable either). Point being, many/most companies know these clauses are insane, but they see no harm in try to throw in the kitchen sink in their contracts because they know a lot of people won't push back.

But hey, we're completely accepting of \"free market\" business executives, investors, owners, etc openly enjoying numerous market restrictions. And we use health care to drastically reduce competition in the employment market by both making it more risky if not outright dangerous to your health and financial well-being to quit your job (even a minor medical injury or accident could bankrupt you) and this also makes it nearly impossible to directly compare compensation between different employers, soooo ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø In many countries if you want to have an employee bound by a non-compete, you have to compensate the employee for that restriction ('garden pay', I believe?), because by restricting who they can work for, you're by that very nature restricting their ability to seek the most competitive pay. Not to mention, if going to work for a competitor would cost you, say, $1M - then surely you can afford to pay them $50k; that's the deal of the century, in fact! Allowing corporations to foist the cost of a non-compete onto the employee is a pretty American concept. \"But but otherwise it would be really expensive!\", I hear the Entreprebros screech. \"I couldn't possibly be in business! Muh Burn Rate!\" My response is, \"...but I thought you said the employee going to work for a competitor is such a huge financial/competitive threat to your business that you should be allowed to restrict how they can make a living to be able to afford food, housing, transportation, to care for their family members, and so on? Which is it?\"...and then I point to all their European competitors who seem to be doing just fine with these supposedly infeasible prohibitions on uncompensated non-competes (and requirements around greater benefits, lower work hours, greater workplace rights, etc.) Technically non-competes should be illegal simply because the contract bears no benefit or compensation to the employee in exchange for the restrictions imposed that wildly benefit their employer. There's zero benefit to working for an employer who requires one versus ones who do not, but the employer gains (by the very nature of the claim of how necessary the noncompete is!) a great deal. The situation is absurd. Imagine McDonalds requiring their burger-flippers to not work for any competitors because those competitors might benefit from proprietary McDonalds business practices, training, etc. We'd laugh them right out of the building and point out how stupid it is because all other things aside, where the fuck else is a McDonalds burger-flipper supposed to work, except a place that is likely a competitor to McDonalds?

There are a whole ton of laws that Republicans want implemented. I'm not sure if they don't count as laws because left-leaning meme-makers strongly disagree with them or because they truly don't realize that Republicans have opinions besides \"big government bad\". To wit: * Immigration law * Laws regarding who you can and can't marry * Laws preventing access to a number of health procedures * Laws regarding what types of substances you can put into yourself * Laws forcing big platforms to not censor speech * Laws enshrining churches as protected institutions And on and on and on and on. If you listen to these memes you'd get the impression that Republican voters are overwhelmingly libertarian, which couldn't be further from the truth. You may well disagree with many of the laws that they want (I do), but it's a bit rich to claim that they don't want any laws when the Democratic Party is basically running on a platform of \"stop Project 2025\". reply consteval 4 hours agorootparentAll those laws you listed are about maintained the status quo or the status quo of a few decades ago, i.e. conservatism. This isn't creating solutions to problems, this is bringing back or upholding problems from some time ago so we can look at them and do nothing. This is the fundamental difference between conservative ideology and progressive ideology. Progressives seek solutions to current-day perceived problems, and sometimes the solutions are bad. Conservatives seek to maintain problems, even across generations, sometimes bringing problems of long ago back into reality. This is why, for example, conservatives brought Jim Crow during the reconstruction era. Is this not regulation? Yes, but it's also a return/continuation of the status quo. It's the opposite of a solution, it's a the problem extended and then actually PROTECTING the problem so it can't be solved. It's an anti-solution. That's one, really old, example. But take your pick of any during American history and you will see this is always the case. Because that's what defines conservatism as conservatism. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentYou're not exactly wrong, but it doesn't matter for the purposes of this discussion because the status quo has shifted in each of these cases in ways that are unfavorable to a conservative, which means in practical terms they have to play the same game as the Democrats do. Neither one likes the status quo, which means both have to implement laws, and both currently choose to do so through administrative action rather than something more permanent. \"Stop Project 2025\" implies what I'm saying: there is a status quo that the Democrats want to protect and the Republicans want to undo. reply consteval 4 hours agorootparent> \"Stop Project 2025\" implies what I'm saying Kind of, but not really. Because Project 2025 is just a vessel. You see, conservatives are so dedicated to maintaining problems they will go to the ends of the Earth. Project 2025 is a power grab, so then that power can be used to maintain the status quo and prevent solutions even more effectively. Of course that will then target transgender individuals, women, gay people probably... whatever is new-ish and we should \"go back\" on. So: > there is a status quo that the Democrats want to protect and the Republicans want to undo ehh... Republicans want to reverse our positioning and trajectory, and Project 2025 is how they do that. In that sense, republicans are still maintaining the status quo (or the status quo of a few decades ago). > Which means in practical terms they have to play the same game as the Democrats do I agree. Both \"sides\" have to pass laws and use \"big government\" to get what they want. And then there's libertarians, who don't really exist because even they themselves don't believe their beliefs. So this is what we have. reply lolinder 2 hours agorootparentYeah, I'm definitely filing this under \"hasn't spent much time with conservatives\". The equivalent comment from the other side is \"liberals are so dedicated to destroying traditional family life they will go to the ends of the Earth\". reply consteval 2 hours agorootparentI spend almost all my time around conservatives. I live in Texas. What I'm telling you isn't the fringes of conservative belief. It is literally the core, the reason why conservatives are conservative. To... conserve. That is not only their end goal, but also their ONLY goal. And in order to conserve, you must destroy what has the ability to change things. If you don't believe me, go back and read Project 2025. It is a vessel, a means to an end. The end being conserving the status quo and strengthening it. Conservatism is the goal of being something old, doing something old.

There are myriad issues where a clear majority of the country believes something should be legal or illegal but congress either takes no action or goes against that will. The issue is that these people are far more accountable to those with the money to run their campaigns than to the common peasant the campaign ad targets. Consequently, the will that tends to get realized in congress is slanted heavily towards the interests of money, and of course it is. Lack of noncompete legislation isn‚Äôt an example of slow pace, it‚Äôs an example of companies that have money slanting politics in their favor to maintain a bit of extra leverage over their workers. reply parineum 13 hours agorootparentThose issues are largely red herrings.

There are exceptions (2010), but even those are clearly cases where something abnormal was happening at the grassroots level, not just the usual 5% pendulum we see with the presidency. And then, once you've successfully changed the makeup of Congress to meaningfully slant in your direction, you still have to also control the presidency or at least work with the president in order to get a bill through. So, yes, Congress can repeal bills that it's put in place. But it takes a lot of work and generally would represent a pretty fundamental shift in voter opinions, which is exactly when laws should change. reply jjk166 55 minutes agorootparent468 of the 538 seats in congress, including 100% of house seats, are up for election every 2 years. On top of this, you don't need to change every seat in congress, you generally only need a tiny handful to flip to switch control - for example at this moment the Senate is 51 to 49 and the house is 220 to 212 (with 3 vacancies). To flip both houses would require only 7 seats to flip, or 1.3% of congressional seats. The big difference between congressional and executive elections is that congressional changes explicitly do not represent national shifts in voter opinions as they are regional elections. Only a national election can demonstrate a true shift in voter opinions, and when such a shift occurs is exactly when laws should change. reply carterschonwald 17 hours agoprevFff.

However, the Supreme Court decided to legislate from the bench and transfer that authority to unelected judges.

I'd like to think they're all taking night school engineering and economics classes to bridge the newly-created skills shortage, but, somehow, I doubt it. For example: In this case, the courts have come to the nonsensical conclusion that (quoting the article) \"The FTC, which enforces antitrust laws and regulates competition\", doesn't have the authority to regulate non-compete clauses, and further claims there's no evidence that the proposed regulation would do anything beneficial (despite 80+ years of case studies from California, which happens to have the largest economy in the US.) reply fallingknife 15 hours agorootparentThe legality on non-competes is entirely a political question and has nothing to do with expertise.

Chevron deference has little to do with the legislative branch's power to delegate authority (and nothing at all to do with the legislative branch's power to explicitly delegate authority). It was about the judiciary not overturning a \"reasonable interpretation\" of ambiguities in the law by an agency, under the assumption that any ambiguities are implicit delegations of authority. Overturning Chevron merely means that a judge can decide which of multiple reasonable interpretations of the law most represent Congress' intent, rather than deferring to the reasonable interpretation chosen by the agency.

It‚Äôs not surprising that a court found the FTC lacked the power to categorically ban contractual arrangements under state contract law. The relevant principles are ones most people learn in high school government class: federalism (employment contracts are a matter of state rather than federal law) and separation of powers (executive branch agencies enforce the law, they don‚Äôt make it). What would require a special explanation is if the court found the opposite. It‚Äôs really appalling how many supposedly educated lawyers would arrive at the wrong answer to something a bright 10th grader could figure out from first principles. reply amanaplanacanal 14 hours agorootparentNot sure I understand your argument. Are you suggesting the federal government can‚Äôt, for instance, set a minimum wage? reply rayiner 3 hours agorootparentThe Supreme Court case upholding the constitutionality of the federal minimum wage as being a proper exercise of Commerce Clause power, United States v. Darby, rests on very weak reasoning: https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/312us100 (‚ÄúThe Court held that the purpose of the FLSA was to prevent states from using substandard labor practices to their own economic advantage by interstate commerce. Congress acted with proper authority in outlawing substandard labor conditions since they have a significant impact on interstate commerce.‚Äù). Similar to Wickard v. Filburn, it gives Congress power over purely intrastate activity based on a tenuous connection to interstate commerce. But there‚Äôs probably some version of both the minimum wage and the ban on non-compete agreements that‚Äôs constitutional under the Commerce Clause. For example, if they were limited to employers that do business in multiple states or if they purported to apply when employees moved to a different state where non-competes were unenforceable. The bigger problem is the separation of powers aspect. As you seem to recognize, banning non-competes seems like banning an unfair labor practice. That something that should be the subject of Congressional legislation, like the FLSA. Congress almost certainly didn‚Äôt intend to delegate to the FTC power over employment contracts, nor could it have given the FTC such an open-ended delegation of legislative authority. reply cyrnel 16 hours agoprevThankfully, non-competes are still illegal under the National Labor Relations Act, as long as the NLRB doesn't change their current interpretation: https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/noncompete-agreements-vio... reply advisedwang 15 hours agoparentThat article says that is the opinion of the NLRB General council but not yet a rule or precedent. > Abruzzo asked agency lawyers to send cases to her office involving arguably unlawful noncompetes.

Let's say this was marriage, and you had people requiring spouses sign a \"noncompete agreement\" with marriage, so that the person, upon divorce, agrees not to date or marry anyone else within a certain distance, which amounts to hundreds of miles. Is there really any question that that would not be an enforceable contract? It doesn't seem any different to me legally.

    "originBody": "Why Are Texas Interchanges Texas So Tall? August 20, 2024 by Wesley Crump [Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.] This is the Dallas High Five, one of the tallest highway interchanges in the world. It gets its name from the fact that there are five different levels of roadways crossing each other in this one spot. In some ways, it‚Äôs kind of atrocious, right? It‚Äôs this enormous area of land dedicated to a complex spaghetti of concrete and steel; like the worst symbol of our car-obsessed culture. But in another way, it really is an impressive feat of engineering. 37 bridges and more than 700 columns are crammed into this one spot to keep the roughly half a million vehicles flowing in every direction each day. They say everything‚Äôs bigger in Texas, but that‚Äôs not always true when it comes to engineering projects in the US. The tallest concrete dam is split between Arizona and Nevada. The longest bridge span is in New York. The longest road tunnel is in Alaska, and the longest water tunnel, not only in the US but the whole world, is the Delaware Aqueduct in New York. The largest hydroelectric plant is the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington, while the largest nuclear plant is in Georgia. But one thing that Texas really does do bigger is highway interchanges. If you‚Äôve driven from one major Texan highway onto or over another, you may have been astonished to find yourself and your vehicle well over a hundred feet or 30 meters above the ground. There‚Äôs no clearinghouse of data for flyover ramp heights, as far as I can find. Plus there‚Äôs the complexity of what a true height really means since many interchanges use excavation below grade for the lower level. Still, even the most conservative estimate puts the High Five taller than the Statue of Liberty from her feet to the top of her head. And if you do a little digging, you‚Äôll find that many, if not most, of the tallest highway interchanges in the world are right here in the Lone Star State. Let‚Äôs talk about why. I‚Äôm Grady, and this is Practical Engineering. The idea of a freeway really started in the 1920s with what‚Äôs now the Autostrada A8 in Italy: an automobile-only road with controlled access. Freeways are separated from local roads with limited ways to get on and off. And if you‚Äôve driven a vehicle in the past century, the idea of a controlled-access freeway is pretty much taken for granted. Smooth curves and limited chances to enter or exit mean more speed and more capacity. But eventually, those big roads intersect other roads (sometimes other big roads) and that creates an obvious challenge. Unlike most roads that cross at the same level on the ground, or as engineers say, ‚Äúat grade,‚Äù freeways use grade separation at intersections. Roads go over or under one another. No traffic signals, stopping, or interruptions. Again, this is nothing groundbreaking. But what if you want to turn from one road onto the other? Just like that, we‚Äôve gone from an intersection to an interchange. And this is where things get a lot more complicated. But we have to build up to it. The diamond interchange is probably the simplest way to get grade separation because it kind of half doesn‚Äôt. Through traffic on the freeway flows right by, in most cases without any need to slow down. But that‚Äôs not true at the crossroad. Ramps enter and leave the highway at gentle angles and meet the crossroad nearly at right angles. Viewed from above, the ramps form a rough diamond shape, giving the interchange its name. The intersections of the ramps and the crossroad are just that: intersections. They are usually controlled by stop signs or traffic signals. Diamond interchanges can often get away with having just one bridge, a relatively small one carrying the crossroad over the highway. So, this can be the cheapest and easiest to build type of interchange to build. But, those intersections create limitations on how much traffic it can handle, so it‚Äôs really only used when the cross road is a minor one. This kind of interchange is sometimes called a service interchange, in contrast to a system interchange, where two controlled access highways cross. As traffic increases, the only way to increase capacity is to eliminate at-grade intersections. So, the largest interchanges implement grade separation for every lane. The classic system interchange is the cloverleaf. Four ramps form a diamond, usually for the right-hand turns. These are directional ramps, that is, they curve toward the ultimate direction a traveler is trying to go. You exit right and end up driving to the right. The OTHER four ramps give the cloverleaf its name. The loop ramps, usually used for left-hand turns, curve around while ascending or descending so they can cross over themselves. So, you can get traffic flowing in any direction with no at-grade intersections and just one bridge. The loop ramps make the whole thing look like a four-leafed clover, but finding yourself on this type of interchange doesn‚Äôt usually feel very lucky. For one, the loops are often pretty tight, requiring motorists to slow way down. And for two, there‚Äôs the weave. Consider traffic entering the highway from one of the loops. In the same place vehicles are trying to get back up to speed and merge left onto the freeway, drivers trying to exit the highway are slowing down and moving right. This inevitably creates traffic as people struggle to merge and cross paths with one another. Along with suboptimal traffic conditions, cloverleaf interchanges eat up a lot of of land. When cloverleaf interchanges were at their height of popularity in the mid-20th century, land was plentiful, and there were fewer cars, but as the volume of traffic increased AND the cost of land went up, engineers had to come up with new solutions to build better grade-separated highway crossings. And so they did. Now, there‚Äôs such a huge variety of freeway interchange designs that it would be impossible to cover them all. The turbine, the windmill, the braided interchange, the ITL, mixes of various designs, and more. Each of these balances the constraints of a project like this in a different way: land requirements, cost, capacity, safety, et cetera. And the design that generally provides the most capacity, on the smallest footprint, (often for the highest cost), is the stack. Like the cloverleaf, a stack has the four directional ramps, usually for the right-hand turns. But we move the exit for the left-hand turn off the main highway to avoid the weaving problem, and fly them over the middle of the intersection where they meet up with the opposite directional ramp. These ramps are often called flyovers, and it‚Äôs easy to see why. The gentle curves and elevation changes of the stack mean that drivers can safely maintain speed whether they‚Äôre going straight through the interchange or changing direction. The curved ramps often bank to the inside of the curve, called superelevation, making it even easier to maintain speed through the turn. This conventional configuration is called a four-level stack. There‚Äôs one level for the freeway, another for the crossing freeway to pass over, and two levels for the flyovers. It‚Äôs bridges on bridges, each one providing enough clearance underneath for large trucks. So these upper ramps end up pretty high off the ground. Four-level stacks are actually fairly ubiquitous in the US these days. These are impressive structures in their own right, but this is where Texas takes it to another level, literally. And it mostly has to do with feeder or frontage roads. Lots of highways use frontage roads running parallel to connect areas alongside that would otherwise be cut off from the roadway network. They allow businesses to develop right up to and facing the freeway with easy access to those coming on and off it, basically keeping areas attached to the roadway network. Texas took the idea and ran with it. Apparently, they started as a way to reduce the cost of acquiring land for road projects. If you could promise the landowner access to a new highway along a frontage road, you're making their property more valuable, so they‚Äôre willing to sell a portion for the highway at a much lower cost. Now, Texas has over 6,400 miles (or 10,300 kilometers) of frontage roads. That‚Äôs almost the circumference of the moon, and as far as I can tell, way more than any other state in the US. I won‚Äôt go into the pros and cons of this approach here. Some research has shown pretty conclusively that the money saved on acquisition costs doesn‚Äôt make up for their many disadvantages. And Texas has since changed its policy to only include frontage roads on new freeways where necessary and justified. Although, from what I can tell seeing new construction these days, there don‚Äôt seem to be many projects where they‚Äôve been left out. And one major effect of putting frontage roads alongside every highway happens at interchanges. Because these are more roads that need grade separation from all the others. So, at stack interchanges around the state, there aren‚Äôt just four levels but five. In fact, this kind of interchange is often referred to as the Texas stack because it's so popular here. In a typical configuration, one freeway goes below grade at the bottom level. The frontage roads sit at grade. The crossing freeway is elevated. Then there are the two layers of flyovers. With a minimum vertical clearance of 16 feet or about 5 meters, plus the thickness of each bridge, vehicles on the highest flyovers are often more than a hundred feet or 30 meters above the ground. It‚Äôs a nice way to get a good look at the city, even if you only get to enjoy the view for a moment. The Dallas High Five is probably the most famous interchange in Texas with its cool nickname, but it doesn‚Äôt stand alone. There are quite a few five-level stacks around the state and even a couple that qualify as six-level stacks with flyovers connecting to other highways. My friend Brian, better known as the Texas Highway Man, documents a lot of new construction in Texas, including this replacement of an old cloverleaf crossing with a five-level stack in San Antonio. These flyovers will be higher than a twelve-story building when they‚Äôre done. The frontage roads for this new interchange use a pretty innovative concept. Four partial roundabouts morph into one funny-shaped roundabout that‚Äôs been lovingly nicknamed the ‚Äúfidget spinner.‚Äù Of course, Texas stacks don‚Äôt exist only in the Lone Star State. The Big I is another famous interchange in Albuquerque decorated with a tumbleweed snowman each winter. The Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange in Los Angeles gets its fifth level not for frontage roads but the high occupancy lane. Plus, it has a railroad at the lowest level, which I always appreciate. Not just because I like trains, but also because it‚Äôs a reminder that these artfully sculpted ribbons of concrete carefully woven together represent a tremendous investment of public money, our money, into a way of getting people from A to B that has a lot of downsides. Everyone has different thoughts about what a city should look like, but there‚Äôs a growing recognition that the way we prioritize motor vehicle traffic in the US may not have been the best path forward. And so, I admit that my ideal city has a lot fewer of these towering interchanges that kind of stand as a testament to a transportation network that doesn‚Äôt necessarily reflect our highest values and aspirations. But, I still find them pretty impressive in their own right, and whenever I‚Äôm in a new city, I try to plan my driving to hit those tallest ramps at the top of the stack to get a bigger, if momentary, perspective on the built environment. It‚Äôs always a nice reminder of our capacity for grand designs and ambitious projects, even if they might not always be the best solutions. August 20, 2024 /Wesley Crump",

The road concrete is roughened, you have good traction even in less than ideal weather. And concrete lasts an awful lot longer under heavy traffic. Smooth concrete would be like you are worried about, but the high speed roads aren't smooth concrete. Asphalt is a hydrocarbon product and can sweat. But worse is the oil from cars. Drip, drip, drip--since it's on a hydrocarbon base it loosely bonds with it and simply accumulates.

First of all the road construction and maintenance uses a huge amount of tax dollars and redistributes it to lower class construction site and road maintenance workers and some engineering bureaus. Secondly it gives everybody equal (highway) transportation access by continuously expanding capacity on existing roads and building new highways to growing towns on the countryside. Poorer people need to buy or rent housing far away on the countryside and highways therefore democratizes their access to the urban centers with lots of jobs. In the specific case of Texas there's also a toll road system, however this only covers a fraction of the highways in the state and the tolls themselves don't account for all the incurred costs. reply consp 20 hours agorootparentPoor people should not have to buy a car as it is a massive drain on finances to keep it running.

In turn because every city that's not New York has just expanded horizontally with hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of detached house-driveway-backyard-frontyard suburbia. In most of the Old World, cities have existed for centuries‚Äîif not millennia‚Äîand were built for the human foot, not the car tyre. Hence most European and Asian city centres are dense, mostly walkable, and fairly small. From the 1800s onward as transport speeds have increased they've built dense mid-/high-rises in the suburban bits, and developed cheap, efficient, and highly-utilised bus and heavy rail public transport, both within and between cities. Many such cities additionally have 'green belts' to prevent urban sprawl. Actually I am misrepresenting the situation in the USA. The US expanded with the railways, and many American cities were built along and at the end of railways. But then in the 1950s, Americans collectively decided that public transport was useless and they bulldozed through their city centres, ripped up the trams and railways, and splatted veritable plates of highway spaghetti right through the middle of their cities (often through slums and ghettos mainly housing poorer people of African descent). reply AnthonyMouse 14 hours agorootparent> But then in the 1950s, Americans collectively decided that public transport was useless and they bulldozed through their city centres, ripped up the trams and railways, and splatted veritable plates of highway spaghetti right through the middle of their cities The causality for this was mostly the other way around. There was a lot of empty land around the cities -- unlike most of Europe or Asia -- so once cars became available people started moving there because they could get more space for less money and still commute into the city by car for work. The real problem is that the people who did this didn't want the city encroaching on their suburban space, but that space was directly next to the city. So they zoned it for single-family homes only and then the only way to add new housing is for the city to expand horizontally. Which needs more roads and parking and reduces use of mass transit which in turn gets discontinued. What you need isn't mass transit, it's to allow condos and mixed-use zoning in what is currently the suburbs, to reconstitute enough density that mass transit can actually work. reply fiddlerwoaroof 13 hours agorootparentHouston is actually a good example of this: the city has no zoning laws and so the workplaces are relatively evenly distributed across the metropolitan area.

Even if you live close to the city core, there are either extremely limited or entirely nonexistent options for groceries, fitness and recreation, coffee shops, affordable eateries, non-alcohol entertainment and art, etc in most neighborhoods. You would still have to drive most of the time anyway. Most of the denser areas closer to downtown can also be quite dangerous for pedestrians after dark. The few places that have denser housing with those amenities within (safe) walking access are exorbitantly more expensive.

The only choice we have as a society is between taxing everyone versus taxing only the users. Exactly right, but proving the opposite of what you request. Once roads are built they're a sunk cost. Roads have to be resurfaced as a result weather damage regardless of how many people drive on them. Road capacity that exists and isn't used is lost. The incremental cost of an additional car driving down a road, the actual wear caused by the act, is trivial. Far less than the pro rata share of building or maintaining the road, or than existing gas tax, or the cost of even the collections infrastructure for road tolls. But the use has value to the driver and plausibly to others in society (e.g. their customers/employers/friends), so we don't want to discourage it unless its value is less than the incremental cost, since the cost of building the road and most of the maintenance is a sunk cost. Which leads to the conclusion that the sunk cost of the road should be shared by everybody, since everybody benefits from having products delivered and emergency services even if they don't have a car. reply dopidopHN 18 hours agorootparentprevIt‚Äôs not about rural places.

No ones saying we abandon all beyond our city walls to nature, instead they'll be farmland or productive rural activities like we already use them for.

But I'll start with the simple version of the critique. Individual commuters make their decision about whether to make a trip based in part on the time that trip will take (a function of road congestion). Thus, adding road capacity will temporarily lower the cost of a trip, allowing more people to make it until congestion reaches the pre-expansion level. Housing does not have this problem because consumers make decisions about where to live much more infrequently. As you can tell, \"induced demand\" is a bad if rather catchy name. To be fair to urban planners, the throughput of an expanded road does increase. However, the experience of using it stays the same or gets worse, and the cost (both $ and space) is disproportionate. Is the pro-transit argument, which I subscribe to. Of course, the real world includes large real estate firms which are making frequent decisions on housing stock. So I agree that the build-more-housing-and-everything-will-improve crowd is wrong. But I don't think YIMBY/transit and anti-transit are the only choices.

OK, I buy that Texas has more grade-separated interchanges on average... but I'm not seeing how that turns into \"Texas has more higher interchanges\" which is what it feels like that question is asking. Frontage roads don't generally exist where 3+ highways intersect, so that shouldn't be relevant for high ones, it just raises many 1-high to 2-high. Or do they, in Texas? Or is it just that Texas has one famous one and people extrapolate that to mean the whole state is absolutely smothered in interchanges, until it looks like a scene from The Fifth Element? reply missingcolours 23 hours agoparentThere are frontage roads at most freeway interchanges in Texas. Typical stack interchange elsewhere has 4 levels: freeway 1, freeway 2, freeway 1 left turns, freeway 2 left turns. Frontage roads add 5th and occasionally 6th levels. The other thing not mentioned is the proliferation of separate express lanes, which often have dedicated flyover ramps as well. reply mikepurvis 22 hours agorootparentFrom a quick skim of Wikipedia, it looks like the main benefit to the stack style over a conventional 2-level cloverleaf is capacity (the left-turn leaves are generally at most one lane) and speed (left turns are direct rather than 270deg, so you don't have to slow down as much when taking them). Still, to this layman it seems like a colossal engineering cost to build all those bridges and ramps for relatively modest gain. reply toast0 22 hours agorootparentCloverleaf intersections have really poor overload behavior. They're fine in low traffic areas, but in places with high traffic, the crossing streams of traffic cause cascading backups. Stack interchanges increase acheivable throughput because you can often build enough road to allow backups for one direction to not impinge on the other flows. It's also easier to build effective signage so there's fewer surprise lane changes. reply dylan604 22 hours agorootparentprevThe TFA specifically covers this, so skimming wikipedia should have been totally unnecessary.

With a stack interchange (and many other types), you often have plenty of time beforehand to position yourself into the correct lane. But if you are going to go through a cloverleaf you will often need to make a stressful weave into the leaf, and then back again into the highway. reply Sohcahtoa82 18 hours agorootparentprevThe gain isn't \"modest\". At a cloverleaf, the weaving between people entering a highway from one leaf and people trying to get onto the next leaf is an utter destroyer of traffic flow, especially when you add in some human behavior, where some people are assholes and won't let people merge in front of them, even when they're trying to merge to the other lane themselves. reply jcranmer 21 hours agorootparentprevThe biggest benefit to stack over a cloverleaf is that cloverleaves have this issue that the same lane needs to be used for offgoing traffic to decelerate and oncoming traffic to accelerate. There's a partial mitigation for cloverleaves, which is to lane segregate the ramps so that there's less pressure for traffic to have to accelerate to highway speed immediately, but stacks eliminate the issue entirely. reply s1artibartfast 20 hours agorootparentDriving around the bay area, it seems that 90% of traffic is caused by shared onramp-offramp lanes, or insufficient distance between them. Many highways otherwise would have much more capacity. The telltale sign of exit issues is highways that bog down to 15mph for a couple miles, only to open up to 60+ with the same number of lanes. Total shame and often unnecessary. I wonder how many man-years are wasted as a result. reply bobthepanda 21 hours agorootparentprevthe size is also a limiting factor for the cloverleaf; a 270 degree turn at reasonable speeds requires a lot of land cause the curve radius is so huge and you're going three quarters of the way around. there is also the weave required between exiting off a loop and other traffic entering onto it. you could theoretically get rid of it by bridging one loop over the other but then you may as well just bridge more of it without the 270 degree turn at that point. and there are also compromise designs like the cloverstack where only two opposite sides are the 270 loops to avoid the weaving problem. reply mrguyorama 22 hours agorootparentprev>Still, to this layman it seems like a colossal engineering cost to build all those bridges and ramps for relatively modest gain. IMO, maybe Texas does this because Texas gets a lot more taxes than they talk about (through high property taxes), and don't really want to spend them on anything else (like socialism!), so instead they build 10 lane highway systems for the billion cars and trucks every american should own. reply vel0city 20 hours agorootparentOne-third of the Texas DPS highway budget comes from federal sources. Another third comes from revenues from oil & gas. About a quarter comes from state gasoline sales tax and registration taxes. So a little more than 90% of the funding for freeway projects in Texas comes from non-property tax sources. But even then, a lot of the recent major highway projects in Texas had some kind of toll component to them whether that just directly be toll roads or tolled \"express lane\" projects which often have parts of those toll revenue backed bonds going to fund things like highway interchanges and on/off ramps for the freeways. The vast majority of the property taxes I pay go towards the schools, the public parks, the fire/police/public service, libraries, and local roads. City+County taxes are ~0.710%, just the ISD and community college is ~1.16%. A massive chunk of those city/county taxes are roads and public service people, with a bit of parks department and other things like that thrown in. The state gets its cut mostly by sales taxes though. 6.25% is the state sales tax, with things like groceries exempted. Cities can levy up to 2% additional, for a max rate of 8.25%. Of that 2% my city levies, half of that goes to public transit. reply s1artibartfast 20 hours agorootparentHow utterly sane. reply lukevp 19 hours agorootparentprevI think this is spot on, but also keep in mind that Texas is a state built for cars, not people.

In areas where large highways were built over small highways, it isn't so easy to add an additional road. reply jcranmer 20 hours agorootparentprevFrontage roads don't necessitate a lot of extra levels. Take the Circle Interchange in Chicago: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Byrne_Interchange It's an interchange that's tucked into the normal street grid of Chicago, taking up about 4 city blocks total, and requiring just 3 levels of bridges to get all the traffic to their destinations. The trick is that it relies on a windmill interchange rather than a stack (so the left turns aren't crossing each other in the center), and the Congress Parkway-into-Eisenhower Expressway goes from elevated highway to sunken highway over the course of the interchange. There's even a subway line in the middle of the interchange! I think the better explanation is that the size of highway interchanges in Texas aren't meaningfully constrained, so there's little pressure to find ways to squeeze in more compact interchanges. Furthermore, I think Texas is motivated to make its interchanges high-speed--the highways look designed for a 65/70 mph speed limit, even near the city core, whereas the Kennedy Expressway near the Circle interchange drops down to 45 mph partially to deal with the confusion of the road (there are exits 51B-J on I-90 in this stretch, yes, that many exits in a single mile of road). reply mrkstu 20 hours agorootparentThat is correct. All the (recent) freeways I experienced in TX were designed to go ~75 mph as a normal speed, even interchanges/overpasses, except the actual turn. Even then the turns on the cloverleaves were capable of a much higher speed than other places. reply hnburnsy 15 hours agorootparentprevDoes HOV lanes add a level?

Once you have the concrete plant, and are renting cranes, deploying a ton of falsework, etc, adding another level or two isn't as insane as it sounds. The big thing is space required, and how much structure you actually need. Texas gets hurricanes, which are a big deal, but not nearly as big of a deal as earthquakes out in california, so, building tall things out of concrete is much more viable than most places. The only real issue in some parts of Texas is that the water table is really close to the surface, so, if you want to build tall, you need significant amounts of footing work so it doesn't sink. reply legacynl 5 hours agoparentprevI don't think there are many 3+ highway interchanges. These interchanges are designed to go in places where highways intersect. And you wouldn't design highways so that more than 2 highways intersect in a single point. If you need to connect 3 highways in a certain location, you can just pull back one of the connections and make 2 separate interchanges instead of one massive one. Apparently no other country makes local stores directly accessible from the highway so 5 layer interchanges just don't exist anywhere else.

Texas really does have more frontage roads than other US states. In the specific example cited in the article's headline photo, both the US 75 and I-635 have frontage roads that cross each other. They stay at ground level whereas the highways elevate. Part of the reason this specific interchange has so many levels, though, which is not addressed for some reason, is that both highways have high-occupancy express lanes that are separated from other traffic and have separate interchanges with the other highway as well as separate on-ramps and off-ramps to the frontage roads. This one is particularly bad because it's where the express lane for the US 75 starts and stops. Normally, the express lanes don't have their own dedicated exits and you have to first exit to the normal highway, but US 75 has an express lane north of I-635 but not south, so there are separate entrances and exits for it here. Thankfully, I've worked from home for years now, but back in the day, this used to feature heavily in my daily commute. My wife and I worked at the same place, so typically used the US 75 express lane where it existed, and it was a bitch. To go south, you have to get off the highway onto the frontage road and then back onto the highway. reply Zircom 22 hours agorootparentThe 75 lane your talking about is actually an HOV lane, not an express one. And I appreciate that it exits off the highway for exactly one reason and it's that it makes it so incredibly easy for the cops to setup their checkpoints to catch single people using the HOV lane without screwing over the rest of the traffic on the highway.

Building stuff is cheap relative to having to maintain it over its lifetime and then eventually replacing it. The more you build the more it costs to maintain it all. That means that from purely an economical perspective there is an optimum where you provide the most transportation for the least amount of money. The US method of building more and more is slowly driving up the cost side of the equation and delivering less and less benefits. That's not hippy-liberal bullshit, but that is just a fact.

They are not rich or even significantly \"well-off\" by most standards, and their homes did not and do not cost as much as a house in a suburban area. The \"rules\" prevent profiteers from destroying the standard of living for people who moved AWAY from density. Why should such people be herded around the country, hounded out of their homes for someone else's (increasingly a corporation's) profit? That's akin to black people being herded out of their neighborhoods for the construction of a highway. reply DidYaWipe 2 hours agorootparentprev\"The people who like suburban density went ahead and made zoning codes to basically prevent building anything but sprawl\" What, exactly, qualifies as \"sprawl\" to you?

So? Those codes exist in SOME areas. They give people a choice of what kind of area they live in. Yes, yes, they were all racist and evil back in the day. Today they serve a valid and non-nefarious purpose: giving people a choice. \"the few remaining places that don't require a car are rare and super expensive.\" Do you have specifics on that? Are you saying there are no small towns to live in? That condos and apartments in the downtowns and city centers and town centers and boroughs of United States cities are more expensive than houses? Take L.A. for instance. It has become very popular to piss and moan about \"single-family homes\" and to pass craven developer handouts in the guise of sham \"housing reform.\" Meanwhile, dead or dying malls sit with boarded-up anchor tenants (there's an abandoned Macy's a few miles from me) and vast empty parking lots growing weeds. Also, downtown L.A. is not \"full.\" Nor are other high-density areas across the county, if you look at vacancy numbers. And then there are the tracts of disused, formerly commercial or light-industrial parcels all over the city and county. And yet already-residential areas are targeted for destruction. And I do mean destruction. In a drought- and heat-plagued area, there is no excuse to promote the wipeout of every last tree and the paving-over of every last yard for the construction of 10 units where a single house stood. Yes, recent state legislation allowed just that, WITH NO REVIEW REQUIRED OR POSSIBLE. A developer's dream. Meanwhile, vast tracts that have already suffered these effects of \"density,\" the aforementioned malls and parkingn lots, sit empty. And on top of all this, nothing is being done about the corporate buy-ups of entire neighborhoods. This is even worse than the \"shortage\" itself, because it takes what housing does exist off the market PERMANENTLY. Corporations don't typically die and leave their homes to their kids.

With service from New York City to New Orleans, the Crescent gives travelers a unique window to the beauty and heritage of the American South. You can tour Monticello or enjoy a wine tasting in the charming Virginia college town of Charlottesville. Or enjoy a stroll through the vibrant shopping and dining scene of Underground Atlanta. As you travel further south, you'll reach New Orleans, where you never run out of things to do. From jazz clubs to Cajun restaurants to Mississippi riverboat rides, the city was simply built to entertain. So you'll have to change trains in NY to get to Boston, but one can definitely go from Atlanta to Boston by train. In the end though, practically nobody would take a train from Atlanta to Boston. Even if you made it 200mph HSR, a direct flight would still be faster. And until both ends of that journey really make the city more walkable you're probably going to want to rent a car at your destination anyways so being at an airport at the edge of town versus the train station closer to downtown it doesn't make enough impact for most people. Don't gete wrong I'm generally pro-train for good city pairs, but chances are I'd never take a train from say Dallas to Phoenix or Denver or Chicago. Flying will just practically always be faster.

If somebody who understands this could explain I‚Äôd be happy. For one, a lot of the overpasses had two lanes. But then they merged down to one right before you got on the highway‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs the point in having two lanes on the overpass that merge just before you get onto the highway? There was always slow traffic because of this. If it was me, I would always make it so that you lose equal number of lanes To the outgoing overpasses as you will get in incoming overpasses to prevent inefficient lane changes. So if you have six lanes, you get 4 branch off, 2 for each direction on the other highway and keep 2. Then you get the four back from the intersection. No lane change. But the way they have it, there‚Äôs so much merging it , which is harder to drive, and I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs more efficient. Any thoughts? reply Clamchop 10 minutes agoparentI don't have experience with Texas but there are plenty of interchanges as you describe in California. Sometimes you even see momentarily more lanes just before and after an at-grade intersection. While more permanent lanes seems more desirable, for lack of space or money or whatever, this compromise at least increases the capacity of the ramp to absorb the queue before it starts to back up into through traffic. Of course, in practice the capacity is often not enough. reply Neywiny 21 hours agoparentprevThere's a cities skylines YouTuber who agrees with you. He calls it lane math. \"2 come off, 2 go on,...\" I'm sure there's some reason the engineers do it irl, but it is funny that going with your approach does fix things in game. reply gangstead 51 minutes agoparentprevI always figured it was so that the bridge acts as a storage buffer for backed up traffic so you don't get the ramp to 635 eastbound so backed up that there is stopped traffic on 75 southbound. I mean you still end up with that at rush hour but I think that's what they are trying to do. There is no number or lanes they could add that would prevent it from being a parking lot twice a day. reply cornstalks 21 hours agoparentprevI have no answer, but this got me thinking: is the overpass's road a similar physical width as the highway? I've been on some bridges that have two lanes with a very narrow shoulder that then then merge into a single lane (with wider shoulders) at the end of the bridge, with the asphalt width not changing too much. I've always assumed that was so traffic could continue flowing on the bridge should one lane become blocked for some reason. Off the bridge a car can pull off the road if there's a problem to let traffic continue passing. You can't really do that so much on a bridge. But I'm not a traffic/road engineer so that's just speculation on my part. reply jader201 21 hours agoparentprevMy guess is the two lanes merging into one are only getting one lane. That is, only one lane is added after the merge, and both overpass lanes are merging into the one new lane. But if there are indeed being two lanes added due to the merge, agree that doesn‚Äôt make much sense. If the former, also agree that they should‚Äôve added two lanes instead of one. But that decision could‚Äôve come down to physical limitations, cost, or something else. reply jcalvinowens 13 hours agoparentprevI completely agree. The ramp from 75 south to 635 west squeezed two lanes into one before it merged with 635, and it was always an enormous bottleneck when there was any traffic at all. But the last time I drove on that ramp was 5-6 years ago, maybe it's better now. reply ajkjk 21 hours agoparentprevI wonder if it's more about having room for emergency vehicles or for people to pull over if there's an accident without totally stopping traffic. reply tedunangst 17 hours agoparentprevDepends on setup, but if the alternative is to merge before splitting off, that can slow down the main highway.

Texas likes to run the frontage roads through the interchange ramps. California generally displaces the freeway about 200m from major surface roads to avoid running the surface street through the ramps. CA-92 at US-101 does that. When too many layers are needed, CALTRANS often goes for a tunnel underneath. See CA-92 at I-280, and SF's 19th Avenue at I-280. At US-101 and I-280 in San Francisco, a frontage road does go through the ramps.

That used to be true in the US. But over the past 50 years, the dominance of the automobile combined with traffic patterns (and related real estate trends) have incentivized the opposite to happen. Suburban commercial development facilitates easier parking, and quicker commutes over secondary highways rather than the traditional congested main arterials into city centers. Many cities in the US already have or are starting to \"doughnut\". While post-war suburbanites absolutely did commute into the city, many contemporary suburbanites live, work, and shop in surburbs.

That's just the traffic from the Northeast going to West. It's not like most of these people in the suburbs of Dallas work in Dallas. They mostly don't, they live and work all over the Metroplex. And given its expensive to sell and buy land, people will often buy a house once and stay there even though their jobs might bounce all over the Metroplex. reply bsder 21 hours agorootparentprev> places of employment, which are generally highly concentrated. This is not true and is one of the problems with getting mass transit to work in the US. Most of the employment in the US is now smeared across the city. I'll give Austin as an example. Austin employment has spaced out clumps. Downtown. The UT campus. The Domain (old IBM/NI area). The Arboretum. Oak Hill. The \"new\" airport. Austin housing has similar clumps, generally dictated by how much you earn. You're probably further out than you would like since the real estate in the center is ridiculous. So, Leander, Hutto, Garfield, or Dripping Springs. Now, plot the flows on a map. Note the massive pileup in the center as people attempt to change sectors across the city. Most modern cities are like this. There are not two or three obvious points that would get a big chunk of the traffic. I chose Austin, but San Diego, Pittsburgh, Nashville, etc. all look similar. And, the news is worse than that. The \"white collar\" jobs that could be concentrated have also been the most displaced by surburban office parks or by WFH. The types of jobs that most people are employed in (service and warehousing--Walmart/Amazon/FedEx/UPS/etc.) are generally specifically positioned where real estate is cheaper which is almost by definition off of any mass transit connector. reply eightysixfour 21 hours agorootparentprev> During rush hour most people are going from their homes to places of employment, which are generally highly concentrated.

I think things need to change. I'm just describing what is. These are people coming from several dozen square miles and dispersing into several dozen square miles, flowing through these chokepoints. They're commuting 40, 50, or more miles. You'd need these people to change several bus lines and several train lines. Those busses would be snaking through messy suburbs for them to be actually useful. Those neighborhoods to pick them up are sprawling with poor walkability and a 15 minute+ walk just to the major road bus stop for a lot of those people. And when they get off the train, they're probably going to need a bus to navigate the sparse fields of giant empty parking lots to their actual workplaces. In fact, for a certain group of people this path practically already has a train service. US-75 runs parallel to the Red/Orange line. Assuming the person starts from Plano to go to their office job in Las Colinas/Irving (a massive assumption here, but practically best case), they won't even need to change trains. Let's ignore how they get to Parker Road station for now (Park and Ride? 15 minute walk through their neighborhood + same time as the park and ride?) and start the clock from there. They're going to commute to the Microsoft offices. They need to get in by 9:00 AM. So they instantly warp to the Parker Road Station, hop on the orange line at 6:46 AM. They get to North Lake College station at 8:07 AM. They then wait for the 229 bus at 8:21, take that 8 stops, hop off, walk a half a mile (~11min), and get there at 8:40. Nearly two hours and they only had to change once. And once again, that's instantly warping to Parker Road Station. Add another several minutes of drive or even more for a bus to connect to the train. Next, they're going to take the highways, including toll ways. They leave from Parker Road Station, head down US-75, hop on Bush Turnpike, and it is an ~30min trip on average. Or they want to avoid tolls. They take US-75 to 635 (taking this High Five talked about here), and it takes 30 minutes to an hour. Now, theoretically this should get a little bit better. There will be a new train line with more of an East-West path that would be useful here. But it'll be a train change at Bush Turnpike Station, and service on this new Silver Line won't be great at first. Potentially a 30 minute wait for the next train at peak times. And it'll still take 50ish minutes after that transfer. So you'd look at maybe a 5 minute train ride from Parker Road to Bush Turnpike, wait 15 minutes for the next train, then still 50 minutes. Plus the 30 minutes for the bus ride and walk. Over an hour and a half, magically warping to Parker Road immediately when the train was about to leave and hopefully only waiting 15 minutes for the Silver Line train. We'll see that it is really like when it opens in late 2025 (hopefully). I'm still excited for it, I'm looking forward to not needing to drive and park all the way out to the airport for travel and having another way to Addison Circle for things like Oktoberfest and other events there will be great. But this is also kind of a best case of someone taking the train versus driving. This is assuming someone lives close to the train lines in Plano. Their office is one bus line away from the station. Tons of people live even further out from there. Lots of people work at places which would require multiple bus transfers. The train doesn't even go halfway out into the sprawl, and the surrounding cities don't want to join DART. But honestly, it makes little sense to me to have people living in Fairview, McKinney, Prosper, and Melissa trying to commute to an office job in Dallas/Irving/Grapevine/Westlake/etc. It's insane to me, but people choose it. But a lot of people here just have a big aversion to taking transit. You're seen as an oddball to many for acknowledging it exists. We live right next to a bus stop that goes to a nice train station. My wife was looking at taking a job that would be immediately outside a train station. She looked at me like I was insane for suggesting she think about taking the train. I usually take it when I go into Dallas and people think it is incredible I survive. I take the bus to the city park with my kids and people wonder what happened to my car. reply kuschku 7 hours agorootparent> Potentially a 30 minute wait for the next train at peak times. See, that's already an issue. Even in small European cities, you'd expect the trains at peak time to arrive every 5min, in larger cities even every 1-2min A train every 30min is what I'd consider \"3am on easter sunday\" level of service, not peak service. Sure, right now there's not enough demand for that. But as they say, if you build it they'll come. reply vel0city 6 hours agorootparentI agree, the service level on that train is pretty bad especially for peak. Hopefully they'll be convinced to run it more. But change that wait, do the math, and compare it to the drive time again. Ok, we shaved a 15 minute average wait to 2 minutes or so. 13 minutes saved, awesome. We're still comparing a well over an hour public transit trip to a 30 minute drive on the tollways. In the end you'll need to convince people the costs of the drive (all the many different types of costs there) are worth the trade for more than doubling the commute time. reply kuschku 6 hours agorootparentThe question is whether that needs to be the case. By combining train and car you can usually end up faster and cheaper if done well as trains won't be stuck in traffic and commuter trains can reliably run at 120-160km/h. See my comment here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41309489 for examples and details on how to solve this long-term. reply vel0city 4 hours agorootparentOnce again it kind of comes back to the density. Without the density, you'll end up with a lot of stations to try and make the line useful to people. With lots of stations, you're not realistically going 120-160km/h average speeds. These DART LRV trains do >100km/h peak speeds. But in the end if you halved the stations you'd really crush the ridership because there's just not enough stuff or people at any particular station. reply panick21_ 10 hours agorootparentprevI was replaying specifically to the 'all people go to the same place'. Just as you have highway interchanges, you have railway interchanges (that are much cheaper). Railways can go into multiple directions and intersect with other modes of transports. I do understand the problem in the way the infrastructure is build in the area and that it isn't easy to just change and go to trains, that's not what I was suggesting. I was specifically responding too: \"Assuming every single commuter is coming from and going to the same place, sure.\" And that if of course nonsense. The whole point of a network is that you can route from one place to another. I didn't propose a whole new transport plan for the whole area. And I am not pretending that within 1 year you can change all of Texas infrastructure. I was simply pointing out a fundamentally flawed argument. > But this is also kind of a best case of someone taking the train versus driving. Well, this is the best case in particular situation you are describing where that kind of infrastructure has been under-invested in for 100+ years. Its not the best case for public transit. It should NEVER take 30 min to swap from one train to another. In all of Switzerland you 90% of all connections are 10min or less. That's for the whole country including buses. If the train infrastructure was more modern and electric, trains could likely be faster. If the buses had their own lanes (not like Texas doesn't have enough lanes) the avg speed of the bus could likely be improved quite a lot. This is just about infrastructure choices, apparently Texas can build tons of super complex incredibly expensive highway interchanges but an electric train that leaves every 15min is apparently impossible. DoT in Texas is still on that 1960 highway building mania and is still destroying black neighborhoods so that subburban wight people can get to their office jobs at the oil company or whatever. The first step is recognizing the problem, and they are still working on that. The whole area seems like its pretty dense with a lot of people, I don't see why it couldn't have good transit. Even just with buses on existing roads. As long as you make some room for them and give them the appropriate priority and so on. A lot could be done for not that much money, if people actually wanted. On of the biggest problem in the US is that your tax system if fundamentally unfair and massively subsidizes suburbia. That's arguable one of the most important things that need to change. I strongly suggest looking at the work done by Urban3 and Strong Towns. reply vel0city 4 hours agorootparentIts incredible how you could read all of that and yet not have any takeaways to adjust your preconceived notions of the reality of life in this area. > infrastructure has been under-invested in for 100+ years. This isn't some subway built in 1920 that has barely even had a new train in the past 50 years. The Orange Line opened in 2010. The Red Line in 1996. Some of the stations opened in like 2014. The rolling stock is mostly stuff purchased post-2008. And with the Silver Line, those are all totally new stations on a totally new path with totally new rolling stock. Clearly, you don't know what you're talking about if you're thinking this is stuff that hasn't been invested in for nearly 100 years. But hey, you watched some YouTube videos, so you know exactly what the realities are like living in DFW and know precisely what would solve it. > more modern and electric The train in my example is pretty new and electric. Once again, you clearly don't know what you're talking about here. > an electric train that leaves every 15min is apparently impossible. The Orange Line and Red Line at its peak is like 7.5ish min intervals. Once again, you clearly don't know what you're talking about here. > If the buses had their own lanes (not like Texas doesn't have enough lanes) the avg speed of the bus could likely be improved quite a lot. What, we're going to have 100mph busses going on surface streets or something? Dedicated bus lanes make sense in areas where there's lots of traffic and gridlock, they can do a lot of good there. The bus in the example isn't in one of those places. That road isn't normally very crowded. Forcing the light cycles for the bus would probably save a minute or two, but once again the overall trip is losing by well over a half hour. The overall trip time is worse because you're going to stop that train several times along its path, that bus is going to stop and pick up people. Whereas the car, even if it goes a bit slower because of traffic, is still keeping its average speed at like 50ish mph. > The whole area seems like its pretty dense with a lot of people That's the thing. It really isn't. Some people have a several minute drive jus to leave their neighborhood, just to get to the first place where a bus stop would even remotely make any sense to be. Some parts are decently dense, and those are the places where people can and do reasonably take transit as their primary way of travel. But it is definitely not the norm. But hey, once again, you're someone that's watched a few YouTube videos and poked around on Google maps, you definitely know more than the person who's actually lived in it for over a decade. > It should NEVER take 30 min to swap from one train to another. Sure. But those trains are going to be largely empty even with the 30 minute service interval. Running them every 5 minutes is burning billions of dollars and lots of energy rolling empty trains. And in the end, look at the math. Shave 15 minutes off the trip. Shave 30 minutes off the trip. The highway path still beats out on time. > This is just about infrastructure choices Its far more about city design overall than just \"infrastructure\". You could replace all the highways overnight in DFW with trains that run every 30 seconds. It'll just increase the overall transit times for all these commuters. Do the math. Look at actual average speeds for whatever design you might propose. It is a fundamental issue with how the cities are laid out and designed from the very foundations. Those average commuters would end up changing trains several times on their commutes. That train is going to have to roll through a bunch of stations and stops in order to actually be useful to the riders. Because its not \"mostly people in this area going mostly to that area\", its people from an absolutely massive area going to an absolutely massive area. > Even just with buses on existing roads. As long as you make some room for them and give them the appropriate priority and so on. A lot could be done for not that much money, if people actually wanted. The thing is, once again, the density and overall design of where I'd want to go. There's a bus stop right outside my house. The routes from there make a decent bit of sense, they go along through a few shopping areas and to the nice downtown Plano area and that bus station there. But I don't often shop at those shopping areas. I go to slightly different ones. So now there would need to either be yet another bus line that goes to each of those different shopping areas, or so much bus service the next bus is just a couple of minutes behind. Otherwise, each of those changes really adds up in time, and suddenly I'm spending 2-3x as much time taking the bus than just driving. And I'm lucky, I live literally on the edge of my neighborhood. Someone deeper in the neighborhood, it is a 15 minute walk to the main road where the bus is. With the weather right now having a heat index of like 110F. That walk alone is longer than what their drive would be to that store. So then what, we have busses snaking through all the small curvy neighborhood roads? Gee, that'll really make the overall travel time higher. This is why I just completely ignored the travel time for that person to Parker Road Station, you include that and for a lot of people it really blows the tra",

At least as far as the readme.md goes. I have been active in the area of browser extension development for over a decade now. And to me, it wasn't very clear at first glance. It isn't crossbrowser extension development (which these days is actually fairly easy if you ignore Safari.... [0]). The README showcases adding a lot of other frameworks and scaffolding, which to me isn't what makes extension development all that challenging. In fact, using a modern modular approach can be achieved using something like rollup [1]. Of course, I do believe that Plasmo makes setting it all up a lot easier. But just looking at the terminal animation I also can't help but feel that it adds a lot of abstraction I might regret later. To be clear, I also do realize that some people don't mind this and think it is easier to not have to think about the details. Only when digging a bit deeper into the actually documentation [2] it starts to make more sense to me. From what I gather: - Manifest creation is done entirely by plasma. You can just declare the thing you want to use or create in the right place like an options page [3]. Which is actually quite neat and something I can see makes things a bit easier for someone freshly starting with extensions. Although I'd argue that the manifest of an extension is not the most complex thing [4], even more when I see that for that with Plasmo you still need to declare similar things just at a different spot [5] - It provides some scaffolding and abstractions around things like storage and messing between content_scripts and background workers. - There are some neat utilities available for publishing extensions. Overall, it looks like it like it does take away the creation of an extension and a lot of the utility functions you would need to write anyway. However it comes at the cost, in my opinion, of extreme abstraction to the degree that a beginner basically will have learned Plasmo and still have next to no understanding of browser extensions themselves. It's one of those things where I wish this sort of tooling was available around a decade ago but I am also glad that it was not given the knowledge it gained me.

Personally, I prefer using the MDN docs [0][1] for web extensions as I am using mozilla's polyfill library [2] anyway. These contain more practical examples and less abstract descriptions at times, including a very thorough getting started guide [3] going over everything including various concepts. The point remains the same though, the basics aren't all that difficult and while Plasmo does seem to make some aspects easier it also seems like overkill in other areas in regard to abstraction.

I like customizing websites for various things, but it would be nice if I had some library I can pull into a userscript purpose-built for customizing websites (like adding pop-up config dialogs, in-line boxes to take personal notes / comment on websites, or just tools geared toward injecting and scanning the DOM using mutationobservers). ... or is this that, since userscripts are implemented via browser extensions anyway reply hnrodey 7 hours agoparentSounds like you're interested in Tampermonkey. reply devvvvvvv 17 hours agoprevImportantly for anyone who dislikes ads: seems to support Firefox too reply thenegation 16 hours agoparentThis information was needed!

The more I write browser extensions though it seems that there‚Äôs not as much benefit to it beyond compiling and bundling everything for you (and the build process does seem to get rather slow rather quickly for me). The author is pretty open to pull requests and feedback when they have time though! reply creesch 11 hours agorootparentI wrote a more extensive comment elsewhere, but for basic compiling a browser extension you can also simply use common tooling like rollup [0] where your manifest just points to the rollup generated files [1]. And if you forgo modern frameworks entirely, you can just have everything in one directory and run everything more or less directly from there [2]. As far as I am concerned, the structure and packaging of web extensions isn't what makes them complicated, although it does seem to be what a lot of people get hung up on. The web extension APIs and their interaction is often a bigger challenge. Publishing is also somewhat of a pain to deal with, although that is more the process around it and the lack of communication from both Mozilla and Google about it at times.

If you target the webextension api and use the Mozilla poly fill library, your code base does not need to be duplicated at all. It adds the benefit of being able to use all API calls in a promise based manner instead of needing to use callbacks. Edit: To give it a bit more context (although you can find that in other comments I left under this post). The polyfill library itself: https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill Which if included allows you to swap out `chrome` callback based calls for promise based `browser` calls. So instead of using `chrome.extension.api.call(() => { // callback})` you do something like `await browser.extension.api.call()` with the same results working in both browsers. Then the only thing where you still need some separation is for the manifest as some keys are Firefox specific and vice versa.

It's bafflingly stupid, and nakedly partisan and outcome-motivated. Some ideas are just categorically bad, and the regulator needs to be able to say that, rather than pretend that the answer is always \"halfway in between\". For his next decision, will he forbid the SEC from regulating all insider trading, since they didn't find a way to target \"specific, harmful\" patterns? And yet somehow I suspect he wouldn't bat an eye if the FDA were to decide that all abortifacients were disallowed, instead of looking at each one individually... And of course, all of that is ignoring that he's flagrantly lying about the facts of the case, in at least two ways: 1. The summary is misstated. The FTC did not find that all non-competes were invalid. It specifically carved out cases where the balance leans toward non-regulation - namely, non-competes for executives. 2. Some of the \"arbitrary and capricious\" reasoning claims that no states have passed non-compete bans as broad as what the FTC did, and therefore none of their quantitative evidence can matter. That is, again, blindingly stupid on the face of it - but it's also factually false, because California has had just as broad a ban on non-competes for many decades. reply rahimnathwani 17 hours agorootparentIt specifically carved out cases where the balance leans toward non-regulation - namely, non-competes for executives. This is false. The FTC tried to ban for all workers and senior executives. The only difference for senior executives is that the FTC didn't retroactively invalidate existing non-competes. Under the FTC's rule, no new non-competes could be signed. reply rahimnathwani 17 hours agorootparentprevFor his next decision, will he forbid the SEC from regulating all insider trading, since they didn't find a way to target \"specific, harmful\" patterns?

In the EU and UK, the general rule is that you employment contract ends as soon as the company stops paying you. Once you have left the company, you cannot be bound by the old employment contract. Some companies choose to pay gardening leave, but in practice you cannot be forced to accept it for any longer than your agreed notice period, and while there might be grounds to sue for breach of contract if you just walked away completely, in general a company can't force anyone to work somewhere if they don't want to. The protections that the non-compete are intended to provide are already provided through other means that will almost certainly apply - things like NDAs or IP theft (which would include knowingly transferring proprietary secrets or processes). Sure, it'd take more time in discovery to prove such an issue, but in general employee protections are considered more important to society than commercial concerns. On the other hand, someone found guilty of IP theft or breaking an NDA will probably find getting a similar level job very hard in the future, because their reputation would be ruined. reply IdiocyInAction 18 hours agoparentNon-competes are a thing both in the UK and several EU countries and quite common in some jobs.

Think of a non-compete as a 6-12 months notice period when you don't have to work (and can actually work for a whole bunch of different jobs, just not for the competitors). >The protections that the non-compete are intended to provide are already provided through other means that will almost certainly apply - things like NDAs or IP theft (which would include knowingly transferring proprietary secrets or processes). Consider a sales manager going to a competitor with the knowledge of prices for the top 10 customers. You can easily memorize these even if you already don't know them by heart. So he takes the same position at the competitor and tells the sales people to go to X and offer $YYY contract, which just happens to be a decent discount from what they currently pay to the former employer. How do you invoke NDAs, IP theft or whatever to deal with this? reply ralferoo 7 hours agorootparent> But you can be forced to work through notice period? No, they can't force you to work per se, but you could (in principle) be sued for breach of contract if you don't serve your notice period. Most employers are fairly pragmatic in the UK. If the employee requests a shorter notice period at resignation time, and they're not actually on the critical path for something, most employers will agree. If the employee doesn't request a shorter notice period, many companies will stipulate that all unused holiday allowance must be taken at the end of the notice period - so the pay period is exactly the notice period from resignation, but the employee finishes early. > Think of a non-compete as a 6-12 months notice period when you don't have to work That's fine if you're on paid gardening leave. If you're not being paid, they have no right to dictate whether, or for who, you can work. > (and can actually work for a whole bunch of different jobs, just not for the competitors). Typically in the UK, the provisions of gardening leave explicitly state that you cannot undertake any paid work. You can study, you can do DIY, you can do garden work (hence the name), even do voluntary work, but you can't take on any other paid work. > Consider a sales manager going to a competitor with the knowledge of prices for the top 10 customers. Typically, if the employee took commercially sensitive customer data (and that includes names, position, phone, email address), then they could be sued for breach of contract. It doesn't matter if they copied the data via USB stick, printed it out or memorised it - they're still breaking the non-disclosure agreements they'd have signed. I should probably clarify that there are non-compete agreements in the UK, but typically they're not enforceable and the real reason they're there is to scare the employee. They're not part of employment law, and so it would be deemed to be a normal contract that would be tested in court based on reasonableness, and in general an employee's right to work would override any restriction in a previous contract. There's actually consideration going on right now that recognises that non-competes exist and to restrict the scope of them. To quote the document [1] that describes the status quo: > There is no provision in the UK employment statutory framework for non-compete clauses, including in Northern Ireland where employment law is devolved. As such there is no statutory definition. However, non-compete clauses are subject to the common law principle of ‚Äúrestraint of trade‚Äù. The principle provides that a worker should be free to follow his trade and use his skills without undue interference, thereby rendering a contractual term (such as a non-compete clause) purporting to restrict that worker's freedom to work for others or carry out his trade or business void unless it is: (a) designed to protect legitimate business interests; and (b) no wider than reasonably necessary. > Consequently, even where non-compete clauses are found in employment contracts, they may not necessarily be enforceable, unless a court considers that the non-compete clause is to protect a ‚Äúlegitimate business interest‚Äù and is no wider than reasonably necessary. > Simply proving that the employer will suffer from ‚Äúmore competition‚Äù is not counted as a legitimate business interest. In broad terms, the courts have recognised that a legitimate business interest may include protecting trade connections (with customers, clients or suppliers) and, more generally, goodwill; trade secrets and other confidential information; and maintaining stability of the workforce. [1] https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7f68b440f0b... reply pandaman 7 hours agorootparentSo it appears the US non-competes are more relaxed than UK ones? In the US non-competes are limited to the actual competition though the pay may or may not be reduced if you work. >Typically, if the employee took commercially sensitive customer data (and that includes names, position, phone, email address), then they could be sued for breach of contract. It doesn't matter if they copied the data via USB stick, printed it out or memorised it - they're still breaking the non-disclosure agreements they'd have signed. I don't know what kind of NDAs people sign in UK, but in the US NDAs have defined scope and in this case, since you have not revealed any protected information, there is no grounds for an NDA breach. If the UK NDAs punish you for using the knowledge you obtained, then it sounds like a unpaid broad non-compete without a term to me. reply ralferoo 5 hours agorootparentI shouldn't have mentioned NDAs there to relate to customer lists, it got left in that paragraph after I trimmed the comment down a lot. Taking customer data would be considered as a form of corporate espionage. There are so many different types of \"knowledge you obtained\", there's no one size fits all answer. If it's generic training, no issue. If it's learning an industry standard practice, no issue. If it's years of solving problems, and having an intuition about solving a new, unrelated problem, no issue. If it's taking a list of customers and contact details, that's commercially sensitive data and a big issue. If you were personal friends with say 5 of the 20 customers, and could show you regularly met outside of a work context then you could arguably show that you hadn't stolen commercial data, you'd just contacted old friends. You might be opening yourself up to undeclared conflict of interest problems though. If through your work you knew of a secret process that was better than the rest of the industry and provided a competitive advantage, and then the new employer you left with also started that technique, that's a big issue and you'd have a real job to prove you weren't stealing secrets. If some technique had already been made public, e.g. by a patent, and your experience allowed someone to replicate the method in the patent, then you'd probably be OK, but then opening up the new employer to a patent infringement case. If it's a non-patented process improvement to a well known process, then probably fine. If you were a high level manager for e.g. Intel and moved to an unrelated tech company, no issue. If you moved to another chip manufacturer, it'd be very hard to prove that you didn't ever make any decisions based on the commercially sensitive information you learned at the previous company. Maybe your new employer might want you to take gardening leave in many cases to protect them from liability of claims for corporate espionage. Alternatively, it might be prudent for the employee to make sure he works on projects at the new company that don't relate to their old work. But essentially, it all boils down to how what the commercially sensitive material is and much damage might be caused by that being given to a competitor. This is where it's back to NDA territory. If you know any company information that's not public knowledge, then there isn't a term limit for when you're allowed to talk about it. Obviously, the longer it's been, the less relevant it's going to be commercially sensitive, and so the less likely you'd be sued for divulging trade secrets, but it totally depends on what that situation is. I also don't think the situation would be wildly different compared to the US. I'm pretty sure Coca Cola would sue someone who knew the recipe for Coke and decided to leak it, and they'd probably win regardless of when they left the company, because maintaining that secret is still critical to their ongoing business. reply pandaman 4 hours agorootparent>Taking customer data would be considered as a form of corporate espionage Again, the same point: if you left the job where you used customer data then how do you deal with that data in your memory? Either you don't give any reason to believe you used it, least you're getting charged with espionage and this would include not working for the competition, effective putting you under indefinite unpaid non-compete. Or you don't perform your job duties, and this gives no reason for someone to pay you. If it's really like this in UK, I can see how you can think non-competes are not needed. I'd rather have an American non-compete where I get money and a defined term though. reply spacemadness 18 hours agoparentprevIt's not the people living under these rules that think they're fair.

Like the point made in this short comedy scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yUafzOXHPE reply burningChrome 19 hours agoprevI live in a \"right to work\" state. As a young corporate go getter, I signed a few non-compete contracts. In two cases, I was lured away by a competitor. In both cases, I tried (unsuccessfully) to hide where I was going. My old companies found out and tried to enforce the non-compete as punishment. Both times, my attorney filed the necessary paperwork, we showed up in the first case and my boss was threatening me outside in the lobby before we went in, telling me I'll never work in this city again. We go in and judge basically laughed at the company and tossed the case immediately. I don't remember the slew of cases he listed, but the message was clear. You cannot keep someone from working in their chosen field simply because you don't like your competitor. Since no laws were broken and I left with literally nothing but the suit I wore in on my first day - they didn't have any reason to keep me from working in my field. The other case went the same way a five or six years later. reply reaperman 19 hours agoparentRight-to-work laws only affect employees' relationship with a union if one exists in their workplace, not employeeemployer relationships. So ‚Äúliving in a right-to-work state‚Äù has no relevancy to your anecdote. reply Terr_ 18 hours agorootparentI'm guessing OP probably meant an \"at-will\" employment state [0], which is rather more relevant. Those two terms are frequently confused, and I place a lot of the blame for that on the blandly Orwellian naming of \"right to work\" laws, which actually take away rights instead. Specifically, it outlaws any group of workers and employers from making a certain kind of voluntary agreement between one-another.

So this explanation still is irrelevant to the anecdote at hand. reply burningChrome 4 hours agorootparentprevYou are correct. I meant \"at-will\", not \"right to work\" reply reaperman 19 minutes agorootparent1) Can you explain specifically how living in an \"at-will\" state (or \"right to work\" state), assisted you in being able to ignore/defeat your non-compete agreement? 2) Do you think that if you were living in the only state that is not an \"at-will\" state (Montana) that the outcome would have been any different for you? How so, specifically? 3) Are you aware that many people living in an \"at-will\" state still have just-cause contracts? My dad did as a school administrator. Living in an \"at-will\" state does not mean that your employer is forced to use at-will employment contracts, it merely allows them to. I'm completely failing to see any connection at all between \"at-will\", \"right-to-work\", and non-compete agreements. While at this point I think you're simply wrong, I'm sincerely very open to learning what I might be missing here! For context: 49 states are \"at will\", which only means that employers can fire you for any (non-protected) reason or no reason at all. The only state that is not, Montana, has a law that employment is categorized as \"just cause\". Montana's just-cause employment law, unique among U.S. states, requires that after a probationary period, employers can only terminate employees for \"good cause.\" This means that an employer must have a legitimate, job-related reason for firing an employee, such as poor performance, misconduct, or other actions that are detrimental to the business. reply DoesntMatter22 19 hours agorootparentprevPeople seem to misunderstand 'right to work' states 99% of the time. reply kstrauser 18 hours agorootparentprevThat's true, but right-to-work states tend to also have lots of other employer-friendly legislation. In theory, you could have a state with a right-to-work law and good employee protections. In practice, I'm not aware that one exists. Right-to-work has become an almost sarcastic shorthand for a state that gives employers strong powers against their workers, and then wonders why they don't have more startups. reply ummonk 14 hours agorootparentIt's ironic because one could make similar first principles arguments against both non-competes and union security agreements. reply candiddevmike 19 hours agoparentprevYou're fortunate you could afford an attorney and successfully argue your case.

There's nothing proprietary or top secret from one place to another, it's just a way to screw someone over if they leave so that they have no choice but to stay. In the UK and EU, we prohibit non-competes specifically to stop this kind of employer power over employees, seeing it essentially as a form of modern-day indentured slavery. On the other hand, for extremely top-level managers or workers with access to commercially sensitive information, I can understand the desire for non-competes, but we would typically solve that by having contractually agreed long notice periods (putting people on gardening leave for the notice period) and NDAs. reply sitkack 2 hours agorootparent> we would typically solve that by having contractually agreed long notice periods (putting people on gardening leave for the notice period) and NDAs.

They sued her in Texas (even though she worked for them in a Northeast state) and the two companies spent $500K battling it out before it even made it to discovery. We were out $20K personally just in legal fees to have an independent lawyer advising us. Neither company cared about her particularly, but were really fighting each other. When the old employer successfully got an injunction against her, then moved the case to Federal court, and laid out what the first year of the case was going to look like (while she was unable to work at all because of the injunction), she pulled the plug and settled with her old company with an incredibly one sided agreement, basically hamstringing her from working in the industry for the next 18 months.

Right to work means unions and companies can't negotiate union security agreements. These are agreements that non-union workers have to pay to support the union, since they are benefitting from the union. Essentially they allow the union to coordinate individuals in a prisoner's dilemma. Where your comment misses the mark is that workers in non-rtw states don't have to join or even pay for unions.

Instead, how about get rid of noncompetes entirely.

Alex Tseng Ares Industries 20 hours ago Embed https://aresindustries.com #govtech#aerospace Hello, we‚Äôre Alex and Devan, and we‚Äôre building the low-cost cruise missiles the United States needs! What we‚Äôre building Ares is building a new class of anti-ship cruise missiles. We are going to deliver the capabilities that the DoD wants in a form factor that‚Äôs 10x smaller and 10x cheaper. Our missiles will be compatible with existing launch platforms, deliver smaller payloads at high subsonic speeds, and take out ships hundreds of miles away. We‚Äôre focusing on ground and ship-launched variants to start but will expand into air-launched versions, as well as versions with extended ranges and different payloads. Why we‚Äôre doing this A war with China in the Taiwan Strait would look nothing like what we've seen in Ukraine or the Middle East. Wargames within DoD and military experts are in agreement that the most useful weapons in such a conflict would be long range anti-ship weapons or cruise missiles. The United States is not adequately prepared. In a potential conflict, our stockpiles will run out in weeks, and we currently don‚Äôt have the industrial capacity to build at a rate that could win a war, much less deter China. Higher-ups in DoD are waking up to the problem, and generals such as Major General Cameron Holt and officials such as Chairman of the House Select Committee on China Mike Gallagher have echoed this sentiment. Recent conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine have shown that our weapons are too large, too expensive for the wars of today. Existing anti-ship cruise missiles are low-volume, multi-million dollar, 3,000 lb behemoths meant to take out large cruisers and destroyers. But Chinese shipbuilding capability is far superior to ours, and we can‚Äôt make enough anti-ship missiles to counter. In addition, huge missiles aren‚Äôt needed to take out the smaller corvettes and frigates that make up the People‚Äôs Liberation Army Navy. And $3M missiles make even less sense to take out swarms of $200k small, unmanned surface vessels. The DoD needs smaller, less expensive cruise missiles, and lots of them! But no one has delivered on that promise yet. How we know how to do this Both of us have worked at multiple defense and munitions startups. Devan is an Army Psychological Operations and Navy combat veteran and has deep experience in operations and business development at well-funded defense startups. Alex was the first engineering hire at an earlier missile startup, built autonomous systems at Rivian and Stanford, and worked on turbojets at CSULB. Where we‚Äôre at now We spent the summer building multiple prototypes and flight-testing them in the Mojave. In 11 weeks, we went from starting the company to flight testing with our own design. We are on track to deliver early working missile systems to our first customers by mid-2025. We believe our vision for anti-ship cruise missiles can help fill the munitions gap that the US faces. At Ares, we would never wish for a war to occur. But by helping to rebuild our defense industrial base, we can make sure the United States is prepared to stop a conflict and save countless lives. Our Ask We are looking for extremely talented aerospace engineers to help bring our prototypes to fruition. If you know any aerodynamics, propulsion, or GNC engineers who are interested in building something incredibly cool and want to make a positive difference in geopolitics, please send them our way!

But my experience was that some big reason for ballooning costs were: - So, so many middlemen. - \"Defense\" premium pricing on everything due to things needing to meet custom specs, and vendors knowing that they can charge extra because it comes out of the defense budget. - Projects always being longer than planned. I don't think I ever worked on anything that met its deadline, and it was after that things started to get expensive. - Extreme hierarchy, all decisions and negotiations have to traverse through the hierarchy. - It is the polar opposite of \"move fast and break things\". We once had a contractor engineer fix a small superficial bug, which took him 5 mins to identify and one line of code to fix - when his manager found out, the bug fix was reversed, and added to the list of bugs. It took around 12 months before the bug was fixed again (exact same solution, of course). Did I mentioned all the middlemen? It's honestly like the insurance industry. Things that could have been affordable, simply aren't, because there are so many levels and layers of expenses. Everyone wants a cut. reply bboygravity 6 hours agoparentWhat's the barrier to entry in your opinion? My train of thought: if SpaceX can make payload to orbit 10 to 100x cheaper, would something similar be possible for cost reductions (and thus market share) in the apparently insanely inefficient defense industry? reply LorenPechtel 1 minute agorootparentFundamentally, SpaceX chose to go with the cheapest approach that works rather than the \"best\" approach. Take, for example, the engines. The Falcon rockets are kerolox (kerosene + liquid oxygen) engines. You get substantially more performance from hydrolox (liquid hydrogen + liquid oxygen) engines. The faster you want to go the more difference this makes. However, they recognized that kerolox is far, far easier to work with and that to put a kilogram in orbit on kerolox is cheaper than hydrolox, even though you need a bigger rocket to do so. I can't find any other western rocket that's anything but hydrolox by the time it reaches orbit. But SpaceX decided that standardizing on the same engine (the upper stage of the Falcon rockets uses the same engine, different engine bell) was a better deal. It's all about mass production. They build a *lot* of Merlins so the cost per engine is a lot lower. Starship is using the same philosophy. Metholox (liquid methane + liquid oxygen), a bit harder to handle than kerolox but still far more friendly than hydrolox. Same engines throughout. (Although they might have different bells on some of the engines. A bell meant for vacuum works better in vacuum, but at best worse in atmosphere and at worst will be destroyed. The Shuttle OMS engines had a minimum altitude requirement (actually, maximum pressure) and could not be used to help with a bad landing. Light them too low and they would crumple.) reply TrackerFF 5 hours agorootparentprevSpaceX make/made things affordable because everything they use is cheap, and have rather focused on an iterative approach. Whereas traditional starships have used expensive materials and astronomical R&D costs, to make sure everything is _perfect_ prior to launch - SpaceX did it the other way. Use good engineering and build the best you can with the cheapest material possible, and start launching stuff ASAP to see where things fail, and then iterate. They also built on existing tech, and saved a bunch there - compared to building something entirely from the scratch, and having to commit to something very early on (even though it might not be optimal in the long run). With defense you'll have to build stuff that works flawlessly, spend a fortune on design and testing, build products which can be stored for decades (and used decades later), buy parts and materials which meet the specs to endure all that. Economy of scale doesn't really apply to cruise missiles. But their (Ares) thesis is that they can bring down costs by making smaller but more cruise missiles, which will yield the same force as the fewer but larger cruise missiles. reply cosmic_quanta 3 hours agorootparentprevI know that Anduril has a different business model: they completely fund the development of new products, and then sell those products to governments. The incentives are better aligned to reduce development costs, since Anduril does not earn until products are rolled out. Maybe this will lead to a cheaper / more efficient defence industry? reply nradov 5 hours agorootparentprevThe barrier to entry is lack of an existential threat. The USA faces no real threats to the homeland and the military budget, while large, is still affordable. So cost effectiveness and efficiency isn't a major priority. Whereas Ukraine has had to get creative with cheap drones and improvised cruise missiles in order to survive. reply keiferski 12 hours agoprevI have been reading a number of books about Eisenhower recently, in preparation for writing a long form post about his decision making process. One of the recurring themes throughout his presidency was the conflict between the former Supreme Commander, who quite literally ordered thousands of men into battle and their deaths, that wanted to work toward some kind of peace and de-escalation with the Soviets with regards to nuclear weapons ‚Äì and the military-industrial-political complex that pushed and pushed him to fund more weapons without any restrictions on the budget or geopolitical implications. Eisenhower of course was no fool and didn‚Äôt disregard the need for weapons, but he generally tried to navigate the narrow path between defending oneself and escalating an arms race. One of the takeaways I had from this was essentially how powerless even the president was in pushing back against the arms race, even against his own people. This of course culminated in his famous farewell speech where he coined the term MIC. In any case, if the dynamics of these kinds of companies interest you, I cannot recommend reading about Eisenhower‚Äôs presidency enough. There was actually a situation with Taiwan that is still quite relevant to today. And I truly hope, but unfortunately doubt, that equivalent amounts of money are being put into startups or organizations that help solve, diffuse, and de-escalate conflicts. reply adrianN 12 hours agoparentIt was my understanding that the Soviet Union collapsed in part because they couldn‚Äôt afford the arms race anymore. reply keiferski 12 hours agorootparentI‚Äôm not an expert in any way on this, but my impression from reading maybe half a dozen books involving the Soviets + living in a former Soviet-occupied country is that the USSR simply wasn‚Äôt ever going to work sociopolitically by nature of its multi-nation imperial structure. The client states were never really assimilated and didn‚Äôt want to be - and the relationship with them was hostile from the start - see the lack of help during the Warsaw Uprising, Hungarian Revolution in 1957, Prague in 1968, etc. So my impression is that the USSR would inevitably collapse and it was mostly just a matter of time. The arms race definitely had an effect on the Soviet economy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs correct to say that was the main reason for the collapse. reply AYBABTME 7 hours agorootparentIt seems like a lot of reasons, many of which derived from hubris and a delusion that one can plan an entire society, and everything that follows from this mistake. Bad economy, over reliance on limited set of heavy industries, corruption, lack of agency; overall reduced economic performance and thus unable to outcompete the US economy, which was forcing the Soviets into an arms race death march. reply arisAlexis 9 hours agorootparentprevOr in one sentence because communism can't work for long periods reply samat 3 hours agorootparentprevIn part, yes, but the main reason was severely mismanaged economy, specifically ‚Äî super unproductive agro. They had to buy food (grain), selling oil. And then oil prices went down. reply uoaei 35 minutes agorootparentThere's some theories that the US poisoned some of the crop fields in the 60s and 70s especially in the Ukraine resulting in inadequate yields, exacerbating the budgetary issues already present from space race / arms race spending. reply Log_out_ 26 minutes agorootparentI'm sure they have such conspirancid paranoia in north korea right now. They are expressions of unvented frustration in unreformable systems. It can not be the ruler or the ideology, and it can not be that the combination is unable to deal with a world that regularly throws you a stick for the legs if you think you have a good run. Pests evolve and the soil becomes less fertile .Industrial Agriculture is not the same every year. it just looks loke that for a layman. reply andrepd 8 hours agoparentprevIf his goal was peace and prosperity why did he send death squads to murder peasants and overthrow the (democratic and very successful) government of Guatemala, in order to increase profits for American companies? Honest question reply keiferski 7 hours agorootparenthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A... The short answer is that the new government in Guatemala was perceived as being communist and therefore potentially hostile to the US, as well as being a ‚Äúfoothold‚Äù that could then spread communism to other Latin American countries. Purely on a geopolitical basis I think it was a bad decision, as it had major blowback on Cuba for example (Che was actually in Guatemala at the time.) Similarly to Iran the year before - it made sense to them at the time but had major negative effects, and so ended up being a really stupid decision. This policy of intervention was actually a deliberate strategy of Eisenhower‚Äôs though, as from his perspective these clandestine regime changes were preferable to outright war and using nuclear weapons, which is what pretty much everyone around him wanted him to do in Korea, Vietnam, and China. Retrospectively it seems to me that the avoidance of outright war was a noble aim, but the strategy put into practice wasn‚Äôt very well thought through. reply omikun 3 hours agorootparent> Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected U.S. president in 1952, promising to take a harder line against communism, and his staff members John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles had significant links to the United Fruit Company. Yup, it was all about keeping those commies out. reply keiferski 2 hours agorootparentAs I just said, the perceived issue was communist influence, which yes, included actions taken against American business interests by the Guatemalan government. And again, this communist / Soviet influence turned out to be mostly illusory and lead to all sorts of bad blowback afterward, ultimately being a bad decision IMO. It turns out that history is complicated and a single line from a Wikipedia article doesn't quite sum up everything. You also need to factor in other ongoing issues around the world at the time, like the Korean War, the Eisenhower-sponsored coup in Iran the previous year, and so on. The Guatemala coup happened in context with those events, not solely because some US elites felt like helping US corporations. reply andrepd 6 hours agorootparentprevAgain, that's a lot of words for \"we murdered a few peasants and set the rest back into debt bondage to increase the profits for a handful of Americans\". I don't see the relevance of talking about nuclear weapons either, when discussing what to do when a small Central American country sets a tax on large properties; seems like a non sequitur. Considerations about \"preventing the spread of communism\" don't really have much strength when you call \"communism\" something which (1) is the lightest possible land reform (expropriating land which is *both* unused and above a large threshold, and paying fair compensation for it), and (2) had tremendous effects on poverty levels, child mortality, economic productivity, etc, in just a few short years. reply keiferski 6 hours agorootparentUh..I'm not Eisenhower and as I said twice in my comment, I think these were ultimately dumb decisions. I am summarizing a complex event based on a few books I read, and I am telling you what the decision-making rationale was (according to the books I read) from the people that made the decisions, not that I thought they were good decisions. My mistake for thinking you actually wanted an answer and not just to argue with the messenger. Next time, go read the book yourself if you want a comprehensive answer. reply thrill 16 hours agoprevSaving taxpayer money in meeting the Constitutional requirements to provide for the Nation's defense is a noble effort, especially seeing as the likely threats are going to be cheap and reasonably effective in a generally permissive environment, a'la Ukraine's lopsided offensive capability vs. Russian ships. Your target cost of $300K is so significantly less than current available munitions that I'm curious what you intend to use to, from what I know from my own experience (I was a very early hire on an aircraft development called the Javelin some years ago), to reduce the cost of small propulsion systems. The FJ-33 we were going to use was around $400K each at the time, and Google tells me it's still around that price. Their effort to build the cheaper FJ-22 was abandoned after we blew one up on the test stand. I don't keep up with propulsion any longer, but I'm curious what you think might replace them in the (guessing) $100K range. reply cameldrv 15 hours agoparentThere is a Czech engine called the PBS TJ-100 that I‚Äôve seen used on some jet powered gliders. It‚Äôs about 290 lbs of thrust and retails for $75k. There is also an uprated version, the PBS TJ-150 that‚Äôs about 340 lbs. I think that would be enough for an antiship missile with a smaller warhead like they‚Äôre building. reply jojobas 14 hours agorootparentIs there any reason not to use much cheaper piston engines? If you're going for saturation of and defenses you don't need speed that much, you only need the ability to hit the target if not shot down. reply siliconc0w 9 minutes agorootparentArmchair aeronautical engineer but other solutions might be pulsejets or ramjets which can be much less complicated and cheaper than a turbofan. reply cameldrv 13 hours agorootparentprevThat's the basic philosophy of what people are now calling \"fixed wing suicide drones.\" It's just a cruise missile with a propeller and a piston engine instead of a jet. Here are the tradeoffs as I see them: 1. The piston/propeller missile is slower, so it's easier to shoot down. If you have a certain detection range, you have more time between detection and impact. The traditional AEGIS type air defense on a high end ship has three layers -- long range missiles, short range missiles, and guns. Guns are the cheapest with the most ammo, but they're short range, so with a fast missile you only have a matter of seconds to shoot it down. If there are a lot coming at you simultaneously, you need more guns to get them all. If they're moving slower, this is a lot easier. 2. Lift is proportional to the square of the airspeed, so the slower you go, the bigger the wing you need. Compare for example the LRASM (the latest U.S. anti-ship missile), to a Cessna 172. They each weigh about the same (2500 lbs), and have very roughly comparable payload and range. Since the Cessna goes about 120 knots and the LRASM goes roughly 600 knots, that's a 5x difference in speed, so the Cessna needs roughly 25x bigger wings to stay in the air. You see this with the span, the LRASM has a span of 8 feet and the Cessna is 39 feet. Obviously the chord on the Cessna is a lot bigger too. The bigger wing will give you a bigger radar cross section, so you're detected sooner. It also makes the missile cost more due to all of the structure, and it makes it hard to put it in a launch tube if the wings are supposed to fold up. I'm sure there are a lot of creative solutions to this with flexible wings, etc, but there are good reasons to prefer a faster missile. Whether that ends up being the war winning solution though, time will tell. Things are a lot different than 20-30 years ago in terms of tradeoffs though. Back then your guidance system with a radar, computer, radio/satellite transceiver, and inertial navigation would weigh over 100 lbs, and cost over $100k in today's dollars, so making smaller missiles made less sense. Now, you can do guidance with GPS, strapdown inertial, and optical, and there are low power and low cost radio transcievers. Instead of a radar, you can do the terminal guidance optically with a multi-teraflop GPU that costs $50. reply jcgrillo 13 hours agorootparent> guidance with GPS This sounds like a major liability, GPS is an extremely brittle and vulnerable system--you'd only need one or a small handful of nuclear warheads detonated in space to knock it out completely. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-happens-if-a... OTOH it would be so much easier now to develop a celestial navigation system that works optically than it was back in the 1950s. reply bartonfink 3 hours agorootparentlmao at equating \"extremely brittle and vulnerable\" with \"susceptible to multiple nuclear missiles shot to geostationary orbit\". thanks for the chuckle. reply jcgrillo 2 hours agorootparentIf you (a superpower) deploy a bunch of GPS dependent equipment, and I (another nuclear power) am fighting you--and I'm less dependent on GPS--why would I not destroy GPS immediately, given that it's not very hard? EDIT: Destroying GPS completely with nukes lobbed into space isn't the only way to mess it up either, it's susceptible to more terrestrial electronic countermeasures as well. It's generally not a good idea to depend on GPS alone, you need other backups as well. Pilots know this It's why they fly with a paper chart and a compass as well as GPS. EDIT: Also, if my opening move is nuking space, I don't just deny you GPS, I also deny you all your other space-based advantages. I'd guess that would be one of the very first things any nuclear adversary of the US would do, because the damage is so asymmetric. reply snowpid 3 hours agorootparentprev\" You see this with the span, the LRASM has a span of 8 feet and the Cessna is 39 feet. \" \" inertial navigation would weigh over 100 lbs, \" Nice comment but please use the internationally and scientificly common units next time. reply xyzzyz 1 hour agorootparentWe are talking about American-built products on an American-built website. I think people would happily use metric units when talking about foreign products on foreign websites, but for some inexplicable reason, these are much less often the center of the conversation. reply impossiblefork 9 hours agorootparentprevBut the piston engine design really have to be slower? For example, some WWII fighter aircraft could be quite fast, easily comparable to the claimed top speed of Tomahawk missile that can be found on Wikipedia and since you'd have less drag I don't think you'd need a huge piston engine. I'm guessing you'd want something like 500 kW out of 200 kg of engine, but that's similar to the claimed performance of the apparently not-quite production ready Zoche Aero-Diesel. reply xyzzyz 1 hour agorootparentLooking this up, Zoche Aero-Diesel were something like 1-3 horsepower per kilogram. You can buy a jet engines for model planes today that will generate 150 HP of exhaust gas power while weighing under 4 kg, giving you something like 30-40 horsepower per kilogram. The difference is just tremendous. Piston engines are not even that much cheaper, and the only reason they are is that we produce literally billions of them every year, so it pays to invest in tooling. High performance piston engines are more complex, have more parts, and more complex assembly than simple jet engines designs that handily outperform them. reply Log_out_ 13 hours agorootparentprevLast miles booster rocket or no enginr after climb? reply zakary 14 hours agorootparentprevI imagine speed and simplicity. There‚Äôs a lot more things that need maintenance on a piston engine reply jcgrillo 13 hours agorootparentSimplest could be a pulse jet like the V1 used, and capable of higher speeds than a piston engine fan or propeller driven aircraft. reply jojobas 8 hours agorootparentprevMaintenance? It works forA naval carrier group is pretty much invulnerable to any single weapon that exists today. I‚Äôm unconvinced. When I worked in the field, they were persistent rumours that modern submarines did sink aircraft carriers in actual exercises which I‚Äôm ready to believe. A diesel submarine with its motor shut-off resting on the bottom is near impossible to detect. Not entirely comparable but see how Ukraine seemingly easily neutralised the Russian Black Sea fleet. Modern Navy are not really built for symmetrical conflicts. My personal belief is that progress in space tracking, missiles, subsea warfare and autonomous weapons have made surface ships mostly obsolete. They have their use but open war is a modern enemy is not one of them anymore. reply htrp 4 hours agorootparent>When I worked in the field, they were persistent rumours that modern submarines did sink aircraft carriers in actual exercises which I‚Äôm ready to believe. https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/navy-freaked-out-how-... This one was pretty widely reported (from 2005) reply nradov 4 hours agorootparentprevThe diesel submarine threat is exactly why carrier strike group tactics have evolved to remain further offshore in deep water while relying on long-range stand-off weapons. SSKs are relatively slow and short ranged so it's easier to avoid them than to detect them. reply markovs_gun 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah the Russia-Ukraine war is basically the Russo-Japanese war in terms of being a grim preview of what happens when industrial nations fight an all out war.

The supersonic missiles that Iran intended to get through, got through. All else was theatre. The point was very clearly made: iron dome can be defeated with cheap drones, leaving the path clear for the supersonic missiles to land on target. Which is precisely what happened.

Essentially this https://youtu.be/hMBICD5rgY0?si=IXalKjfvs0pSL5B6 Imagine launching hundreds of these from the US or Japan and then they just camp at the bottom of the East China Sea. If tensions escalate, they can migrate towards the Taiwan Strait. And then, emerge potentially just hundreds of meters away from corvettes and landing vessels, fire off their missiles and then submerge. reply RandomThoughts3 12 hours agorootparentWhy do you want to fire missiles if you have the technology to basically manufacture hundred of autonomous torpedos? Would be much more efficient to just detect the ship from the bottom and then go explode under it. Torpedos do much more damage than missiles. reply ethbr1 13 hours agorootparentprevI've always felt like I was missing something obvious for why there weren't submarine-launched SAMs or ASMs. Seems like a really good way to target AWACS/tankers and valuable softer shipping, provided you have missiles with active guidance and can deploy launch pods under the sea, scoot, and then they launch when you've left the area. Granted, much harder to do before networked unified sensors, but not nowadays. reply semi-extrinsic 10 hours agorootparent> deploy launch pods under the sea, scoot, and then they launch when you've left the area There are multiple dealbreaker for this: a) the launch pods need to be quite large in order to contain missiles and the surrounding infrastructure, probably including buoyancy control etc, b) submarines are veery slow so they need a long time to leave the area, c) the pods need to hang out near the surface to receive signals and to launch missiles, so they have a high risk of being detected before they can be used It's probably more feasible to consider unmanned \"disposable\" submarines that can fire missiles. Still you have the problem of low speed and tricky communications though. reply yetihehe 10 hours agorootparent> the pods need to hang out near the surface to receive signals and to launch missiles, so they have a high risk of being detected before they can be used You can now send encoded sonar pulses. With good microphones on pods, you can communicate over many many kilometers and those commands can be pretty short, no need to \"real time fpv\", just \"target a ship currently at {X,Y}\". reply euroderf 10 hours agorootparentprev> the pods need to hang out near the surface to receive signals and to launch missiles I'd think you could do some variation on attaching a long fiber optic filament to a fishing bob that has just enough electronics. reply RandomThoughts3 12 hours agorootparentprevASMs would not be very useful. First submarines have piss poor detection capability outside of their sonar which severely limits the range at which they could launch them. Then they already have torpedoes which are effective against ships and can be guided from the range at which a submarine would be likely to want to fire. SAMs have been considered mostly to fight against their natural enemy: the helicopters but I don‚Äôt think it has ever been actually fielded. The issue remains the same in both case. Submarines are slow and firing is loud and basically broadcast your position to everyone. reply maxglute 12 hours agorootparentprevThere's exploration of integrating hypersonics with antiship strike capability on subs. But the TLDR is until PLA's massive A2D2 expansion to 1IC and beyond (1500km+), there aren't any adversaries that can prevent carrier groups from operating permissively - USN CSG airwing had standoff advantage against everyone. Hence (IMO) little reason (without consider technical stuff like extending kill chain to underwater - subs would need to get target queuing from above water sensors) to integrate SAMs/ASMs into subs, because as expensive as carriers are, subs are even more expensive per unit of fire/tube/vls. Extrapolate from Zumwalt hypersonic retrofit projections current 80 cells for TLAM (tomahawks) whittles down to ~12 CGHBs (common hypersonic glide bodies) to a SSN (~20 shots) and all of a sudden it costs 100-200m+ per shot on a 2-4B Ohio class. Extrapolate to SSNX @6-8B and cost ratio per shot gets even more ridiculous. reply tomatotomato37 6 hours agoparentprevThe state where naval carrier group is invulnerable to surface attacks is also when it's at it's weakest, since at that point is when it's CIWS's IFF is short-circuited to maximize response time. At that point your defenses are shooting down everything in close proximity to the ships, including any of your own planes/missiles you are attempting to launch. Your only option at that point is to wait out the missile wave, while your opponent is still free to maneuver around and do things like attempt to engage with cannons/torpedos. reply nradov 4 hours agorootparentCIWS is already being phased out. reply anon291 16 hours agoprevGood.

The only thing that works is deterrence, and then to beat them in a war if they decide to fight it. The obvious example is WW2, where appeasement backfired. The recent example is Ukraine, where the West appeased Putin in 2008 around Georgia, in 2014 around Eastern Ukraine, and again after he invaded in 2022 by slowrolling arms and placing restrictions on Ukraine. This appeasement mindset is a failure of cognitive empathy. You as an individual can be reasoned with. The people around you can be reasoned with.

CCTV7 (PRC military channel) released footage of automated PLA cruise missile component gigafactory last october capable of making 1000 components a day, insinuating scale of their smart munition acquisition. Which is to say a few days of production can satuate existing US+co missile defenses in 1IC, assuming typical 1500km cruise missile range, US can literally move every land missile interception system produced and stuff every VLS cell of existing USN hulls with anti missile defense in theatre, and PLA cruise missile gigafactory going brrrt will saturate with a few weeks of production. Which is to say, they're indicating they can build so much cruise missiles, likely cheaper than ARES, that US + co simply don't have capability to preposition enough hardware to survive in attrition game. That said, doubt ARES can out compete PRC... on industrial output. Obviously an effort has to be made to increase munitions production, but I doubt ARES can do it for 10x smaller / 10x cheaper. IMO focusing on antiship is misguided, there's plenty of advanced munitions to sink limited PLAN ships, the problem is PLA has enough land based fires to probably destroy most of US+co hardware in theatre with spares. IMO there's this misconception that destroying PLA navy will somehow stop PRC war efforts, when bulk of PLA fires is largely land based (magnitude more than naval fires), including eventually proliferating prompt conventional global strike to hit CONUS, at which point no US hardware is really save. Ultimately, PRC will gladly trade PLAN for USN... since US global security architecture breaks down without navy, and that 600x ship building advantage is going to help PRC reconstitute faster. The actual US+co ordnance deficit is munitions for hitting PRC mainland, to take out PLA landbased fires, realistically can't cut much on size because 1IC deployment either means ships outside of PRC A2D2 range, or on land (likely limited to JP/PH) which means 1000km range just to reach PRC coast and 500-1000km more to hit interior sites. Unless you include SKR, but they're not that suicidal. Which means need something size of existing cruise missiles, if not larger. And depending on how it's deployed (i.e. on ship/airplane), the hardware has to be relatively over engineered to survive the logistics chain of being forward deployed (i.e. mechanical vibration / salt air). PRC's advantage is they can produce magnitude more munitions + with less demanding deployment + a lot more room to deploy launchers (most of mainland) vs US with limited deployment regions. This is without mentioning modern anti air has nearly 100% interception rate on subsonic munitions. Question is going to be, can AREs make more cheaper cruise missiles than PRC can make interceptors. At which point it might be more cost effective to focus economizing higher end munitions. Remember it COSTS a lot in man power + logistics to just sustain deployment. Maybe this will be comboed with many autonomous launch platforms... but that's when you run into deployment geopolitics, i.e. JP citizens aren't going to like (or likely allow) 1000s of launchers dispersed on their roads for survivability, and you can only fit so much on Okinawa/Luzon. There's a lot of constraints to US trying to win the numbers game in both production and deployment vs PRC, but at the same time, peer power attrition warfare is a numbres game.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a revolution took place in American military aircraft design. The invention of the jet engine made it possible for aircraft to fly far higher and faster than ever before. While the fastest propeller-driven aircraft of World War II topped out at slightly less than 500 miles per hour in level flight, jet-powered aircraft in the mid-1950s were flying at over 1,300 miles per hour, twice the speed of sound, with even faster aircraft on the horizon. Achieving this level of performance required not only powerful jet engines, but a whole host of new aircraft technologies: materials like inconel and titanium, and manufacturing methods that could produce far stronger and lighter aircraft parts. One promising technological advance was to use large forged or extruded parts. Forging is a manufacturing method that shapes metal by applying pressure, usually by hammering it or squeezing it with large presses. Extruding is a similar process that shapes metal by squeezing it through an opening of the proper shape. At the time, both forging and extrusion were used to produce aircraft parts, but parts were limited in size and needed to be stitched together with hundreds or thousands of fasteners. By using very large forgings and extrusions to replace many smaller parts, components could be thinner, lighter, and stronger. Aerodynamic surfaces could be smoothed, and seals could be tightened. And by eliminating so many individual parts (along with the time and effort to attach them together), large forgings and extrusions could potentially reduce the time and cost required to build an aircraft. While there were a variety of different methods for making very large parts, such as casting and machining from plate or billet, forging and extrusion had several distinct advantages. ‚Ä¶Machining from plate or billet requires tremendous machines and many machine-hours. A part machined from plate or billet is not as consistent in its mechanical properties as a part forged or extruded to finished or nearly finished dimensions. Mechanical properties in the center of thick plate or billet are questionable. Forgings have the added advantage of variable grain direction which generally can be tailored to the stress patterns of a specific design. The large percentage of stock going into chips [in machining] is unfavorable. Casting materials do not have sufficiently high physical properties, nor have casting techniques developed to the point where efficient metal distribution and thin sections can be obtained. ‚Äì Symposium on Heavy Presses But the size of forgings or extrusions was limited by the size of the presses used to make them. Very large forgings or extrusions would require building presses of unprecedented size. Machines would need to be ten stories tall and capable of exerting hundreds of millions of pounds of force. In the 1950s, the Department of Defense undertook a program to build such presses. Known as the Heavy Press Program, it funded the construction of four large forging presses and six extrusion presses. Upon completion, the largest of them were the largest presses in the world. The program was an enormous success. Not only did the large parts produced by the presses greatly reduce the cost and increase the performance of military aircraft, but the presses proved useful for making parts for things like helicopters, submarines, spacecraft, and commercial jets. Within roughly a decade the presses had returned more than double their investment in reduced manufacturing costs, and they continued to produce complex, high quality forged and extruded parts over the subsequent decades. Six of the ten presses are still operational today. Origins of the heavy press program The origins of the Heavy Press Program can be traced to Germany in the 1920s. As a condition of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was forced to give up many of its western iron-producing regions, creating a chronic shortage of iron and steel. This drove Germany to make greater use of other metals, like magnesium and aluminum. Germany was the first country to produce magnesium on a commercial scale, starting in the 1880s, and it was an early leader in the development and use of high-strength aluminum alloys. It was found that while aluminum and magnesium responded poorly to being shaped by hammering (they tended to shatter, particularly magnesium), good results could be achieved by squeezing them in hydraulic presses. As a result, Germany built a series of increasingly large presses in the years following WWI to make large forgings and extrusions from magnesium and aluminum. For forgings, it built a 7,000-ton press, followed by three 16,500-ton presses, followed by a 33,000 ton press, with plans for an even larger 55,000 ton press. Progress in extrusion presses was similar: by the end of WWII, Germany had four 12,000-ton extrusion presses in various stages of completion, and a 25,000-ton press on the drawing board. (‚Äútons‚Äù refers to the pressure capacity of a press, not its weight. So a 7,000-ton press is capable of exerting 7,000 tons of force.) The U.S. became aware of Germany‚Äôs large press capabilities as early as 1942, when inspection of the wreckage of German aircraft revealed forgings far larger than anything the U.S. could produce. The U.S. responded by starting work on a large, 18,000 ton forging press at the Wyman-Gordon plant in Massachusetts, but it wouldn‚Äôt be completed until 1946. German large aircraft forging (left) vs same assembly made from multiple smaller parts, via USAF Following Germany‚Äôs surrender, the U.S. and the Soviet Union divided up its large press capabilities as well as its rocket scientists. The U.S. dismantled four German presses and had them shipped back to the states, while the Soviet Union secured the 33,000-ton press, the designs for the 55,000-ton press, and a number of German metallurgical experts. By the late 1940s, a confluence of factors was pushing the U.S. towards building its own series of large presses. Rapidly improving aircraft performance was creating a need for lighter, stronger aircraft parts. The Germans had shown what could be achieved by using very large aircraft forgings and extrusions, and the U.S. had several years of experience from operating its own 18,000-ton press. The Soviet Union had taken the largest of the German presses and was presumably building more of its own, creating the risk that the U.S. might fall behind in aircraft manufacturing capabilities. The Air Force studied seventeen different aircraft then under production, surveyed several different aircraft manufacturers, and concluded there were large potential benefits from building very large presses for forgings and extrusions. In 1950, the Department of Defense initiated a program to build 17 large presses: 9 die-forging (where hot metal was squeezed into a mold) and 8 extrusion. The expected cost, including presses and necessary supporting facilities, was $389 million. This was later cut down to 10 presses: 4 extrusion and 6 forging (in addition to the 18,000-ton Wyman-Gordon and the four presses taken from Germany), which would ultimately cost $239 million ($2.8 billion in 2024 dollars). The program would be funded by the Department of Defense and managed by the Air Force, but the presses themselves would be leased to and operated by private industry (a choice that was controversial at the time). In return for very attractive lease rates, the companies would be responsible for any costs associated with maintaining and operating them, and the government would receive 4 to 5% of the revenue made from their operation. This arrangement required some degree of selling on the part of the government. Private industry had to be convinced to participate, and that the presses would be sources of revenue and not simply a constant drain due to maintenance costs. Aircraft designers likewise had to be convinced that the presses would be available, and to design parts to take advantage of them. (Historically, aircraft designers had been reluctant to design parts that could only be made in a limited number of facilities.) The heavy presses Construction on the presses began in 1952 and was a monumental undertaking. The largest, the 50,000-ton forging presses, were behemoths: each was the size of a ten-story building, and could exert enough force to lift an entire battleship. The 35,000-ton forging presses weren‚Äôt much smaller. Even the 12,000-ton extrusion presses were 120 feet long, with parts twice as tall as a man, and more than twice the capacity of the previous largest American extrusion presses. Loewy 12,000 ton extrusion press, via Steel. Cast steel component for a 12,000-ton Lombard extrusion press, via Steel Most of the forging presses themselves would be underground, and required a 100-foot deep hole lined with concrete walls 13 feet thick. The forging and extrusion presses alike were made up of massive iron and steel components that were some of the largest metal parts ever produced: 200-ton cross beams, 90-ton cylinder supports, 145-ton tie rods. The parts were so large that special manufacturing and transportation methods were devised to handle them. Special furnaces needed to be built to fabricate the 108-foot tie rods for the forging presses, and multiple cranes were needed to move them. Some press components exceeded the weight limit for what a single rail car could support, and so were carried by multiple rail cars at once. Parts were produced by American fabricators like Bethlehem Steel, but also came from all over the world: England, Scotland, France, and Japan. 275 ton steel ingot prior to being forged into part of a steel column for the Loewy 50,000 ton forging press. The huge presses required equally huge supporting infrastructure. Hydraulic systems for the presses required water tanks thousands of gallons in size, and complex pumping systems that could pressurize water up to 7000 psi. Huge new furnaces had to be built, along with new, larger tools like saws and stretching devices. Mills had to figure out how to produce larger ingots of metals like aluminum to feed the large presses. At Alcoa, an entire 500,000 square foot factory was built in Cleveland to accommodate the 50,000- and 35,000-ton forging presses being installed. Turning a steel column for the 50,000 ton Mesta press on a 110 inch lathe. By 1954 the first heavy presses were operational, and by 1956 they had all been completed. The presses quickly proved their worth, greatly reducing aircraft part counts and manufacturing costs. In one case, four forgings replaced a collection of 272 individual parts held together by 2,700 rivets. In another case, nine large extrusions replaced 81 smaller parts and eliminated more than 9,000 fasteners, reducing part cost by 30% and weight by 6%. And the new presses were also faster, further increasing production efficiencies. Reducing in machining on part for the B-52 by using heavy presses, via American Machinist. The presses eliminated machining time as well as parts and fasteners. Typically, a forging or extrusion didn‚Äôt come out of a press perfectly accurate, which required machining to carve the part down to its final dimensions. Likewise, very large parts had often needed to be cut down from large pieces of plate or billet. While machining wasn‚Äôt totally eliminated by the heavy presses, their ability to produce thin and complex parts near in size to the final shape required meant that machining time was greatly reduced. In one case, a part that started weighing 1,600 pounds and had more than 1,200 pounds removed by machining, at a cost of $18,000, was replaced by a part that started at just 321 pounds and required $500 worth of machining. Another part went from needing 23 pounds of material removed to just 2 pounds removed. These savings had a significant effect on the total cost of aircraft being produced. Savings on the Convair F-102A were estimated to be $20,000, around 1.6% of the cost of the aircraft. The savings on a heavy bomber was estimated to be even greater, around 5-10% of its total cost; savings on the B-52 alone were estimated to be greater than the entire cost of the Heavy Press Program. By the 1960s, the heavy presses had saved the government an estimated $500 million in reduced manufacturing costs. Aircraft components that could be made on the heavy presses, via Aviation Week. And it wasn‚Äôt just aircraft that were able to take advantage of the new press capabilities; parts from the presses were used in ballistic missiles, nuclear submarines, and armored vehicles for the Army. The presses were used to forge the beryllium heat shield on the Mercury space capsule, and the huge aluminum ‚Äúanchors‚Äù that attached the Saturn V rocket to the launch pad. In 1956, the presses were first used to produce parts for commercial aircraft, and by the 1960s this was common ‚Äî a 4,000-pound titanium beam made on the heavy presses to support the landing gear on the Boeing 747 was the largest titanium forging that had ever been produced. Partly this broad range of uses for the heavy presses came from expanding the range of materials used in them. Originally the presses were designed to make parts from aluminum and magnesium, but by the 1960s they were not only pressing aluminum and magnesium but steel, titanium, nickel, copper, columbium, beryllium, and a variety of other metals. The heavy presses have been described as ‚Äúthe most rapid and far reaching advance in metal processing in industrial history,‚Äù as well as the biggest leap for aircraft manufacturing in industry history. By the early 2000s, parts from the heavy presses were in every U.S. military aircraft in service, and every airplane built by Airbus and Boeing. The two 50,000-ton forging presses remained the largest closed-die forging presses in the U.S. until 2018, when they were surpassed by an even larger 60,000-ton press. Conclusion The Heavy Press Program is a classic example of military technological spillovers, and the potential returns from government investment in technological capabilities. The heavy presses were built specifically for military purposes ‚Äî making lighter and stronger parts for supersonic aircraft ‚Äî but once they were built, they proved useful for all sorts of other things, from spacecraft to power systems to commercial aircraft. The U.S. has accrued the benefits of the presses for 70 years and counting, and at least part of America‚Äôs success in commercial aircraft manufacturing can be attributed to their existence. Some have gone so far as to say that the entire modern American aerospace industry owes its existence to the heavy presses. The Heavy Press Program also shows the importance of manufacturing improvements for technological progress. The sorts of design for manufacturing optimizations that the presses made possible ‚Äî replacing a large number of parts and fasteners with a smaller number of larger components, reducing machining time ‚Äî not only reduce manufacturing costs, but they changed the economic calculus as to what sorts of technologies are commercially viable, and thus get further developed. The heavy presses made it possible to build strong, precise, lightweight aircraft components more cheaply than other manufacturing methods, making things feasible that otherwise might not have been. An official Air Force statement from 1964 states that ‚Äúto catalogue the significant accomplishments of the heavy press program is almost to relate the history of our modern advanced aircraft,‚Äù and credits it for making things like aircraft wet wings (where the wing of the airplane holds the fuel) inexpensive enough to be viable.1 We can see a modern, obvious parallel between the Air Force Heavy Press Program and Tesla, which has created a similar revolution in car manufacturing by using large aluminum castings to replace dozens or hundreds of smaller parts. Like the Heavy Press, using large castings required building new, larger capacity machinery, in the form of ‚ÄúGiga-casting‚Äù machines of unprecedented size. Tesla was the first car manufacturer to adopt large castings, but the savings were so significant ‚Äî an estimated 20 to 40% reduction in the cost of a car body ‚Äî that they‚Äôre being adopted by many other car manufacturers, particularly Chinese ones. Large, complex castings have been described as a key tool for not only reducing cost but also good EV charging performance. The experience of Tesla with large castings suggest that there‚Äôs still opportunities available to push technology forward by making large, complex parts in a single step. Even with large presses, we may not have exhausted the possibilities. The largest closed-die forging presses have now reached 80,000 tons (in China, naturally), but as early as the 1950s experts were speculating that presses of up to 200,000 tons might be useful for aircraft manufacturing. Experience developing the SR-71 led Kelly Johnson to believe that the U.S. needed even larger, 250,000-ton presses, and in the 1980s the Army studied whether presses of up to 200,000 tons might be useful. But no such presses were ever built, either in the U.S. or elsewhere. And in fact, recent experience suggests the U.S. might no longer be willing or able to take advantage of this type of opportunity. Much of the experience in building machinery of this magnitude has been lost, or has migrated elsewhere. The original heavy presses were built by American companies like Loewy Hydropress and Mesta, but when the 50,000-ton Alcoa press was refurbished in the early 2000s, the parts came from German company SMS, the same company that built the 60,000-ton forging press. And while American car manufacturers are using large Giga-casting machines in their manufacturing operations, those machines themselves are overwhelmingly built by Chinese or Chinese-owned companies like IDRA. Technological progress means building things that have never been built before, which often means pushing the boundaries of manufacturing technology forward. Fail to do this, and you risk being outcompeted by people who do. 1 Making aircraft out of aluminum at all was only possible because of the invention of the Hall-Heroult process, which drastically lowered the cost of producing aluminum.

This is a super underappreciated fact! It's often repeated that forging is just stronger, but just squishing steel does NOT make it stronger. Forging a part is so much more than just smashing it into a shape. Steel cable is made of pretty ordinary steel which is stretched 100s of times its original length. That process alone makes it 2-4x stronger in that direction. You stretch steel and it gets stronger in that direction. Do you see how complicated that optimization process becomes? The process steps are not just trying to take it to the final shape. Your piston rod needs to be strong lengthwise, so you actually want to start with a short fat ingot and stretch it out instead of one that is near-final size. Think of making an I-beam. You could hammer out the middle, making it thinner. That would give you a bit of strength there but very little on the edges. If you instead pull the edges out, you create a long continuous stretch that will be very strong against bending. Where, how, and in what order you stretch makes all the difference. You may want to leave extra material and cut it off later, so that your grains are all oriented together instead of tapering to a point. For any moderately complex part, this process is as complicated as modern engineering problems. With poor steel you genuinely need to understand how to foster and bring out those continuous lines or your corkscrew will unwind like playdough.

Take a polyethylene bag (LDPE) and stretch the material in one direction. You might notice the material becomes thinner but also stronger. This is due to the polymer chains becoming aligned.

For inspiration: https://youtu.be/k_LA_R4ifYk The idea behind forge welding is you get both parts nearly molten (e.g. \"welding heat\") then your hammer blow (or the pressure from a huge press) puts enough energy into the weld area to briefly melt it.

Mostly with casting and pressing in a good light, machining not so good. As somebody who knows absolutely nothing about this stuff, I wonder‚Äîcasting, I thought, was generally a lower quality option (like cast iron doesn‚Äôt have fantastic high-performance material qualities, and I had some crappy cast pewter toys as a kid). Are there different, higher quality casting processes, and I‚Äôve only seen the bargain bin results? Is there a general ranking of the quality of the result or is it all very complicated and material specific? reply hwillis 2 hours agoparent> like cast iron doesn‚Äôt have fantastic high-performance material qualities Cast iron is a material, not a process. It's an unfortunate legacy term for very high carbon steel (>2% by weight, or 1% carbon precipitates out into graphite within the steel, causing it to behave totally differently. Less rusting, but weaker and much more brittle when solid. Less viscous when liquid, so you can cast long and thin parts. > Are there different, higher quality casting processes, and I‚Äôve only seen the bargain bin results? There are, but it mostly is independent of the material. Some turbine blades are cast as single crystals for heat stability; you can't really cut a single crystal without introducing cracks and issues. There's also vacuum casting and spin casting (using a centrifuge to force liquid into the mold), which lets you cast metals that react with air or cool too quickly for normal methods. Most of the variation in process is about the final form you cast into, though. Engine blocks are sometimes cast into a one-off ceramic shell that is sprayed onto a sand form. It's an expensive process but it lets you do the whole thing in one step. > is it all very complicated and material specific? It is very material specific. Fundamentally its all about shaping the grains. In many steels you can physically alter grains. In others, like precipitation grains (aluminum alloys, some steels) the structure is determined by the cooling and you can't physically shape them. In that case you may often get a better structure by casting since you can choose how to cool parts down, while a billet will have a homogenous structure that is usually worse towards the center. reply hedgehog 2 hours agorootparentMonocrystalline turbine blades are one of those things that make me appreciate how deep the state of the art is for a lot of \"simple\" things when you look closely. reply pfdietz 1 hour agorootparentprev> The >1% carbon precipitates out into graphite within the steel, causing it to behave totally differently. Less rusting, but weaker and much more brittle when solid. If one adds some magnesium or cerium to the alloy, the graphite precipitates out as spherical nodules rather than feathery dendrites. The resulting material, called ductile iron, is much less brittle than traditional cast iron. An advantage of the higher carbon content is a reduction in the melting point (by > 300 C), so the material is easier to cast than low carbon steel. reply spenczar5 2 hours agoparentprevCastings can achieve shapes that are impractical to machine. A classic example is a spoked wheel. The spokes are really hard to make precisely with machining, but fairly straightforward when casting. Bandsaw wheels are virtually always cast, for example. Also, the processes are not really independent. It can be much cheaper to do a rough casting, and then machine just the critical faces of it, instead of using an ‚Äúoff the shelf‚Äù hunk of metal and machining it all into shape. So it‚Äôs not really ‚Äúcasting is superior to machining‚Äù or vice versa. More that machining is high precision but expensive. Casting has some up-front cost but once the patterns are made, each item will use material quite efficiently. reply IshKebab 1 hour agorootparentSpoked wheels aren't cast because it's hard to machine them. You can easily CNC them if you really want. But that would be insanely expensive and wasteful and not any better. reply spenczar5 1 hour agorootparentYes, I said ‚Äúimpractical‚Äù, not ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù. reply mrob 2 hours agoparentprevThey also talk about forging. Forging can produce higher quality parts because metal has a grain structure. Just like wood, it's easier to break between grains than across the grain. Forging is deforming the metal without melting it. If the temperature isn't too high, it will deform the grain structure along with it. The grain can be aligned to make the metal stronger along the axis where it needs to resist the most force. Wikipedia has a image of an connecting rod that has been etched to show the grain: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/ForgedCo... You can see the grain has been stretched along the length of the narrow parts. Wrenches are another example of something that's commonly forged for this reason. reply debacle 3 hours agoparentprevCasting isn't necessarily \"lower quality,\" it just has different properties. It's also much older (by thousands of years) than machining or pressing, but you can't get to the pressing or machining step without having an ingot, which comes from the casting process. The main drawbacks of casting are you get a hard, but brittle product with (generally) uneven quality. There are processes (like annealing, though I don't know how you anneal a massive component) that can solve these problems, but all iron/steel is \"cast\" at some point. reply BlueTemplar 50 minutes agorootparentUntil the mid-1800s, basically only the Chinese used cast iron, since it's so brittle. Ingots would come from smelting, not casting. reply bluGill 1 hour agoparentprevWhich cast iron? There are many different grades/alloys with different properties. Sometimes cast iron (some specific grade) is better sometimes it is worse. And of course you can cast things other than iron, cast steel does exist (rare outside the feed to a press, roll, or some other process, but you can cast steel into a specific shape if you want to). There are trade offs. The topic is so broad we cannot even start to talk about it. Instead we start with what your application needs and then look at the options to get that. Cast iron is fantastic for building machine out of - while it isn't as strong, it is stable against vibration. There is a reason engine cylinder selves are often cast iron. > I had some crappy cast pewter toys as a kid Those were pot metal, not pewter (pester has many definitions but implies some qualty control). They are made out of whatever melts in a pot - often whatever is cheap at the recycle yard (without trying to identify what is in the metal - including lead which shouldn't be used in toys). Typically no control of the alloy was made and often they start with several different things that are great in isolation but when mixed result in bad behavior. Then the next time the make the toy they use different mix and get different properties. If you spend a little extra to get a known alloy pot metal is a high quality castings with great properties. > I‚Äôve only seen the bargain bin results You have likely seen a lot of non bargain bin results. However since the parts are invisible you never thought about it or the alloy used. You see the failures and so casting gets a bad reputation because it is obviously used in the cheapest things with low quality control. (the door knobs in your house are likely cast pot metal plated with brass, but they last for decades) reply WJW 2 hours agoparentprevMachining is fine, but in the context of the article the problem is that it usually starts off from plates or otherwise block-shaped materials. That means that if you have a weirdly shaped part full of holes and/or with many protrusions in weird angles (as vehicle parts tend to have), then you either have to combine many smaller parts into a final part or have to machine away a huge amount of material from a solid block to come to the final shape. It would be much better to cast or forge the part into roughly the right shape straight away, so you'd need only minimal finishing work. That is what these presses enabled. reply bagels 2 hours agoparentprevOther materials can be cast, such as various aluminum alloy. Casting can have a higher cycle time, be cheaper, and require a less expensive equipment. reply colechristensen 2 hours agoparentprevCast iron is a material, it's good for what it's good for but its material properties don't really come from the casting process, just the ratio of iron to carbon. Casting has problems with thermal expansion, plenty of materials shrink significantly as they cool and complex parts cool unevenly which can cause them to break or deform. Casting has problems with microstructure, plenty of materials, especially steels develop complex crystal structures with multiple phases of materials as they cool from liquids and even extensively in hot solid phases. It's hard to control this in a cast part. Casting has problems with precision. The molds just can't be all that precise when in machining, a thousandth of an inch can be a relatively large distance. However casting gets a bad reputation because most of the time you see it it's because it's actually very cheap, cheap materials, cheap process, minimal post processing. Higher cost things don't necessarily realize the savings from casting as much so they don't use it. And also a lot of higher quality materials have higher melting points which require more advanced tools to melt and handle. Plenty of things though are cast and then machined, you notice this if you look. reply shepherdjerred 53 minutes agoprevWhat strikes me is how great of an investment this turned out to be. Does the US invest in manufacturing like this anymore? Tangentially, if there were a war today would the US be able to produce as much as it did in WW2? reply waythenewsgoes 26 minutes agoparentIn terms of raw output, the answer is likely no. However, this might not matter as much now as it did in the past due to nuclear weapons being the primary deterrent in war these days, and the fact that our standing fleet of aircraft, aircraft carriers, nuke subs, tanks, etc... is essentially second to none. Additionally what we do have is highly capable and extremely specialized, in my opinion, leading to not really needing as many (quality over quantity). Take for example, an F35, which doesn't really have an equal in the skies, we have over 630 of them, with the goal of having around 2500. China only has 300 J-20s which are basically a copy of the older F22. Russia only has 22 non-test Su-57s. Would we have a realistic need to build 1000 of them within a year? Due to many factors, but primarily free trade and globalization, it's unlikely that we ever see that non-automated manufacturing capacity return, though if needed we could probably mobilize the economy via the defense act to force more manufacturing capacity, though it's hard to imagine we would currently need to. reply bradford 30 minutes agoparentprev> Does the US invest in manufacturing like this anymore?

AAPowerLink to couple large-scale solar and energy storage deployment The AAPowerLink project is set to deploy between 17GW and 20GW of solar capacity and between 36.42GWh and 42GWh of energy storage to connect Australia‚Äôs Northern Territory with Singapore via 4,300km of subsea cable and supply power to the territory‚Äôs capital, Darwin, and the surrounding region. The project aims to deliver up to 4GW of green electricity to Darwin‚Äôs green industrial customers over two stages of development. 900MW will be provided in stage one and approximately 3GW in stage two. 1.75GW will also be supplied to customers in Singapore. Once complete, it will be capable of delivering up to 15% of Singapore‚Äôs total electricity needs via a 2GW high-voltage direct current (HVDC) subsea cable, Sun Cable said. Electricity supply is anticipated to commence in the early 2030s. Sun Cable will also invest further in communities in the Northern Territory, Singapore, and Indonesia to help progress the project to the next stage. Indeed, the organisation is continuing negotiations of Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUAs) with Traditional Owners across the project footprint in the Northern Territory. In Singapore, Sun Cable is working with the Singapore Energy Market Authority on the conditional approval application for the project‚Äôs subsea cable interconnector component. Sun Cable is also engaging with the Indonesian government on regulatory and permitting matters to prove that the subsea route includes knowledge and hydrographic data sharing.

    "commentBody": "Australian government approves AAPowerLink project to export solar to Singapore (pv-tech.org)121 points by wmstack 13 hours agohidepastfavorite169 comments vlasky 6 hours agoI'm Aussie and I can't believe this Sun Cable project is being taken seriously by our government. The longest submarine power cable in the world - the Viking Link - is a mere 756 km long and cost US$2.2bn to build. Sun Cable calls for a 4,200km submarine cable to be built! I do not expect the construction cost to scale linearly and I shudder to imagine the maintenance difficulties and expenses. Back in December 2015, Australia's 290km long undersea Basslink cable broke causing the 2016 Tasmanian energy crisis. It took 6 months to get it working again. Basslink eventually went into receivership on 12 November 2021. Something to ponder. reply qbxk 11 minutes agoparentThey just began running a team of barges down Lake Champlain to lay 546km of cable from Quebec to NYC for $4.5B https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champlain_Hudson_Power_Express reply fidotron 1 hour agoparentprevThat is nothing.

I can understand that the combined probability of breakage along the line could be a maintenance problem but the construction cost should have many amortizable components that deliver some sort of economics of scale. I haven‚Äôt done the math so I have no idea on actual viability or if it‚Äôs a good idea or not. reply rmbeard 1 hour agorootparentIt's a bad idea. reply boringg 1 hour agoparentprevIts a great sound byte for the politicains. Politicians aren't known for the economic and business acumen. Sound bytes and promise of jobs get them elected. Don't know the details of this project but if the cable is subsidized by the government it doesn't matter if it scales super or sublinearly, taxpayers are on the hook. reply gonzo41 3 hours agoparentprevTasmanian energy crisis was because of a drought, not because the cable was cut. Tassie exports energy and the power company had lowered the dam levels selling power to Victoria that year expecting regular winter rain. That rain didn't happen. That, then combined with the line fault caused the issue. In fact, the suspected cause of the line issue was that the power company Tassie Hydro zapped the export line with too much current trying to make money from Victoria. That combined with the lowering of dams, perfect storm of greed and bad luck. In addition, the boats that service these cables are mostly in the northern hemisphere, where most of the undersea cables exist. So there was a ~5 month wait on the repair. I'd expect a 4000Km cable to have it's own fleet of boats for servicing. reply Djdjur7373bb 11 hours agoprevDoes it actually make economic sense to run a cable large enough for that kind of power from Australia to Singapore? I would have guessed there must be enough domestic customers or in Indonesia that would make more sense. reply londons_explore 11 hours agoparentPower cables are getting cheaper and cheaper. The expensive part used to be the voltage conversion stations at the ends, but with mass production of MOSFETs for EV's these have now become far cheaper than the JFET's and other exotic silicon that used to be used. In turn, that means voltages can be higher, letting one use more of the cheaper PVC or XLPE insulating material and less expensive aluminium for the same amount of energy delivered a large number of kilometers. To be honest, I don't think we're many decades away from the cable+conversion stations themselves cost being irrelevant, and the administration costs, land purchase costs, etc dominating. reply coryrc 2 hours agorootparent> The expensive part used to be the voltage conversion stations at the ends, but with mass production of MOSFETs for EV's these have now become far cheaper than the JFET's and other exotic silicon that used to be used. Why do you believe these things are related? HVDC lines operate in the hundreds-of-kilovolts range. For example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basslink operates at 400kV. There are no MOSFETs or JFETs directly involved in stepping down that power. reply londons_explore 2 hours agorootparentSemiconductors are stackable to get higher voltage. They're parallelizable for more current. Cost scales linearly with voltage and current, and is therefore constant WRT to system power. reply bhy 8 hours agorootparentprevWhy higher voltages can result in cheaper insulation materials? Wouldn‚Äôt it be the opposite? reply londons_explore 7 hours agorootparentNah - the insulation material costs ~ $0.80/liter, whereas aluminium conductor costs $6.50/liter. If you can have the conductor 1mm^2 thinner (capable of carrying less current for the same heat production) and the insulation 1mm^2 thicker (capable of handling a higher voltage) and transfer the same power, then you'd save money. It only works up to a certain limit obviously - the relationship is non-linear and there is an optimal point. The actual tradeoff involves a lot more modelling, because you need to consider all kinds of other factors, not just the costs of the conductor and insulator. reply ikekkdcjkfke 9 hours agorootparentprevWould they be using AC or DC? I heard that very long cables using AC can be more lossy reply jaidan 18 minutes agorootparentThe problem with long distance AC is the reactive power component caused by the capacitance, and the voltage rise caused by the Ferranti effect. The reactive component has significant impact on the generation equipment and grids. It also causes the Ferranti effect, where the voltage along the cable rises. This can make managing the voltage within the cable difficult because at no load, the load end has a higher voltage than the source, and when loaded, the middle of the cable has a higher voltage than both ends. During stable operation these effects can be managed with Statcoms, shunt reactors and voltage regulation tap changers. However during transient operation you will be relying upon the static protective devices such as surge arrestors, depending on how large the transient is. DC transmission does not suffer from the same reactive power component and has less losses, but it does require large convertor stations at both ends. reply goodcanadian 2 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn't seem like anyone directly answered your question. As far as I am aware, all long distance undersea power cables are high voltage DC. I believe this has to do with the efficiency of power transfer over long distances. reply immibis 1 hour agorootparentAC loses power by inductively and capacitively coupling to nearby objects. It's manageable at medium distances above ground, cheaper than a pair of converter stations. However, water is much more conductive than air and losses from an underwater AC cable would be much greater. reply BillSaysThis 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is Australia, it's AC/DC! reply londons_explore 7 hours agorootparentprevAC is a sine wave, of which the peak is a factor of Sqrt(2) higher than the DC voltage. That means your insulation needs to be sqrt(2) thicker - ie. 41% more insulation material. On top of that, you also have losses to the cables capacitance with AC. But DC has the cost of the conversion stations to consider - both capital cost and efficiency causing operational cost. reply tdrz 6 hours agorootparent> But DC has the cost of the conversion stations to consider - both capital cost and efficiency causing operational cost. I suppose you mean AC-DC conversion stations. Assuming only solar energy will be \"pumped\" over the wire, then the \"only\" conversion stations that are needed are at the consumer, right? I said it before, I don't know much about electricity, so please correct me if I'm wrong. reply lazide 4 hours agorootparentIt‚Äôs really difficult to make solid state components that work at million+ volts. It‚Äôs comparatively quite easy to make transformers that work at million+ volts. So anytime you need to do any sort of voltage boosting, conversion, or the like, DC is going to be expensive and relatively fragile compared to AC. If it‚Äôs just once, that‚Äôs not bad. If it‚Äôs often, that sucks. reply nsonha 8 hours agorootparentprevis there any thing special about the nature of such project that makes you ask this question? By default, long range transmission is always DC for that exact reason. reply Kuinox 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat material is made the power cable ? I thought copper was getting more and more expensive ? reply londons_explore 11 hours agorootparentSome use Copper, but usually Aluminium is used. Aluminium is far less dense, which in turn makes the whole cable bigger, which has other costs (eg. fewer kilometers of cable fit in a boat). Usually it's still the best choice overall though. reply Kuinox 7 hours agorootparentThanks for the reply reply snoxy 11 hours agoparentprevAussie politicians are too busy propping up coal and proposing unrealistic nuclear solutions to seriously focus on renewables. reply chii 11 hours agorootparent> proposing unrealistic nuclear solutions to seriously focus on renewables. they're doing unrealistic nuclear proposals, because they know it takes a long time to ramp up, and in the mean time, their buddies' investments in the coal industry gets time to exit and profit properly. It's designed to prevent losses in fossil fuel investments. Not to mention that australian nuclear cannot be profitable imho - not when solar is so cheap. Their current proposals for nuclear basically requires taxpayer subsidies. reply Gibbon1 10 hours agorootparentLast time I visited this it felt to me that Australia's metro's are small and spread far apart so that a typical sized nuke plant is overkill. reply eru 9 hours agorootparentThe South East of the country has some decent sized metro areas that aren't too far away from each other. reply preisschild 10 hours agorootparentprevNuclear power plants, which have been successfully used for decades, are ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù now? reply defrost 8 hours agorootparentUnrealistic in Australia for a solid report's worth of reasons that make them economically unfeasible. https://www.csiro.au/en/news/all/news/2024/may/csiro-release... Meanwhile nuclear is feasible in China, South Korea, maybe in the UK (who are well into sunk cost on their next reactor already), and probably in the US. reply BLKNSLVR 4 hours agorootparentprevMy understanding is that I the time it takes to build a nuclear power plant, a helluva lotta solar power generation can be built and up and running and generating power. And in that time span as well, solar power will increase its efficiency. And then batteries, to store and deliver that power outside of generation hours, are a parallel to that. If a nuclear power plant could be built quickly and simply, the equation would be different. Unfortunately, from the limited amount that I've read, nuclear power plant projects often run over time and over budget, exacerbating the time scale issue I described above. reply pas 9 hours agorootparentprevthere has been an unfortunate \"phase shift\" since 1970 in the nuclear energy industry/ecosystem, mostly because the risk engineering principle/mandate called ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable), and of course reasonable does not mean profitable.

Indonesia is much poorer than Singapore, and has awfully inefficient bureaucracy and regulatory environment. reply rv3392 11 hours agoparentprevI'm unsure about Indonesia, but domestic customers in that region would be pretty limited.

Large datacenter are in the 100MW sort of range, so only single digit GWh per year. Australia generates a few hundred TWh per year. 272 TWh in 2021/22 - or 272,000GWh, around 20 times what this project will export to Singapore. Data centers and Aluminium and Iron smelters are big electricity consumers. But they barely even move the needle compared to cities with millions of households. reply philipkglass 1 hour agorootparentApproximating bauxite as pure aluminum oxide [1], 40 million tons of bauxite contains about 21 million tons of aluminum. A ton of aluminum takes about 14 megawatt hours of electricity to produce [2]. That would be about 294,000,000 megawatt hours (294,000 gigawatt hours, or 294 terawatt hours) to turn Australia's bauxite exports into aluminum.

Presumably those in Singapore have a lot more buying power though. And the politics are more favourable for big capital investment projects. reply gizajob 10 hours agorootparentYeah, they also have zero room left so I guess the option was between more dirty power stations in Malaysia or this.

The question is just one of opportunity costs: what else could you do with the land? reply bigiain 9 hours agorootparentI'm pretty ignorant about Singapore, but... I get the impression it's quite small. Wikipedia says 750 sq km. The solar farm powering this Suncable project is 12,000 hectares, or 120 sq km. So the solar farm is 1/6th the size of Singapore. Although Singapore is only planning to buy around 1/3rd of the capacity, so maybe this'd be equivalent to only 40 sq km, or 1/20th the size of Singapore. I suspect there are more profitable uses to the Singapore economy for land reclamation than dropping solar panels on it? reply eru 4 hours agorootparent> I suspect there are more profitable uses to the Singapore economy for land reclamation than dropping solar panels on it? Oh, I thought you were talking about power stations in general, not only photovoltaic. Yes, there are more profitable uses in Singapore.

Current is Singapore military vs region is like PRC:TW in the 90s... back then TW with US equipment was one of the more potent forces in the region and could stomp far larger/poorer countries with inferior hardware. But advanced equipment can only scale so far vs quantity, and as rest of ASEAN gets wealthier they're going to build out more modern capabilties, at scales that rich but small Singapore won't have the resources to defend against.

If the risk of an additional delay of 12 months mentioned above in the final scenario does materialise it would result in an estimated additional cost of around ¬£1 billion in 2015 values. https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/dedicated-sections/journ... ---- The only reference to the 9% figure you mentioned comes from a BBC article from 2018 > However, Dieter Helm, professor of Energy Policy at the University of Oxford, told the BBC that the government shift made sense. > \"The sheer cost of building new nuclear power stations means it makes sense for the government to help finance projects like this,\" he said. > \"Governments can borrow much more cheaply that private companies and that lower cost of borrowing can drastically reduce the ultimate cost. Hinkley Point C would have been roughly half the cost if the government had been borrowing the money to build it at 2%, rather than EDF's cost of capital, which was 9%.\" https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44363366 I couldn't verify it anywhere else though.

What happens after that is still subject to other people. There's hope of a domestic customer as well. That's important because the location is pretty unpopulated and otherwise under-developed. Prospects for onshore HVDC to customers are low right now: the closest thing is a service called \"Copperstring\" targetting the mining/metals industry being done in Qld but its about 1000km away and there are few customers except at the end of a long line That aside, Darwin and Port infra will be there but on the normalised \"3 million homes\" model of scaling Darwin is 60,000 homes or less. reply dyauspitr 11 hours agoparentEdge of its exclusive zone is still 200 miles away from its coastline.

(\"peak power\" that is only achieved when the sun is right above the solar cells with no atmosphere in between). The plan seems to be to store 36-42 GWh, and to deliver 2 GW max. That makes for a 20h energy storage at full power, and a big enough power reserve to recharge that storage during the day while delivering at full power. Likely a reserve for morning/evening/clouds. Easy to add more storage. So, it's a 2 GW power link, not a 20 GW power link. It's a 20 GWp site, and that's impressive too. At 200 Wp (STC) per sq m, that is 100M m¬≤, or a 6 mile square not counting any access roads.

The benefit is that the receivers on the ground can receive energy directly from the sun when the sun is up, and the space mirrors can be used to provide light to areas that are completely dark in winter. I don‚Äôt think microwave beaming is ever viable Most fusion concepts are thermal power plants.

You are right that it will be a while before remote corners on earth become more expensive than space for solar power generation. But not 'never'. (Btw, if you think really big, the limit for how much power we can use on earth is given by how much waste heat we can radiate into space. At some point, you don't want to keep beaming down energy from space into earth, even if you somehow could convert 100% of the received power into electricity with no losses: because at the end all the electrical power used will still turn into heat. Heat that we will have to get rid of. At that point in time, you might want to use the electricity directly in space, eg to run data centres there, and just beam the results of the computations down.) > Assuming the worst-case predictions of climate change come true, there will be more than enough desert capacity along the equatorial areas to provide power for the rest. While climate change might become unpleasant, I have no clue what it has to do with any of this? The surface of the earth will stay roughly constant and so will its orbit, and the sun will shine regardless of what happens on earth.

The late-stage trial on tirzepatide also found that patients experienced sustained weight loss over the roughly three-year treatment period. Tirzepatide is the active ingredient in the company's highly popular weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro. In this article LLY Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT WATCH NOW VIDEO05:32 Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks on 3-year obesity drug study: This is a profound result Eli Lilly's highly popular weight loss drug reduced the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 94% in obese or overweight adults with prediabetes compared with a placebo, according to initial results from a long-term study released Tuesday. The late-stage trial on tirzepatide, the active ingredient in the company's weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro, also found that patients experienced sustained weight loss over the roughly three-year treatment period. Adults on the highest weekly dose of the drug saw a 22.9% decrease in body weight on average after 176 weeks, compared with 2.1% for those who received a placebo. Shares of the pharmaceutical giant gained 3% on Tuesday. The results suggest that Eli Lilly's treatment could meaningfully delay a potential diagnosis for people with prediabetes, or those with blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as Type 2 diabetes. More than 1 in 3 Americans have prediabetes, according to the latest government data, which health experts say can be reversed with lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. People who are overweight or have obesity are at a higher risk for prediabetes. The new data also shows the potential long-term health benefits of taking a buzzy class of obesity and diabetes medications called GLP-1s, which mimic hormones produced in the gut to tamp down appetite and regulate blood sugar. As Eli Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro and injections from rival Novo Nordisk have skyrocketed in popularity over the last two years, the companies have raced to study other clinical uses for their drugs. The results are \"another reminder of the huge investment which Lilly has made to prove not only do you lose weight but when you do on this medicine, it converts to health benefits. This is our fourth study this year that does such a thing,\" Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks told CNBC in an interview, adding that tirzepatide has shown promise as a treatment for heart failure, sleep apnea and fatty liver disease in three other clinical trials. Eli Lilly tested tirzepatide in more than 1,000 adults over 176 weeks in the phase three trial, followed by a 17-week period where patients stopped treatment. It is the longest completed study on the drug to date, according to the company.

Eli Lilly published 72-week weight loss results on a larger group of patients from the same trial, called SUMOUNT-1, back in 2022. Patients in the trial who stopped taking tirzepatide during the 17 weeks began to regain weight and saw an increase in progression to diabetes. But those participants still had an 88% lower risk of developing diabetes compared with a placebo, according to the latest phase three results. \"On the drug, we can keep healthy body weight down for three years and ward off diabetes,\" Ricks told CNBC. \"When you come of the drug, a percentage of people do begin to gain weight and then‚Ä¶begin the advance again toward diabetes.\" Still, Ricks noted that patients don't \"snap all the way back as if they were never on the drug.\" The safety data on tirzepatide during the trial was consistent with previous studies on the drug, according to Eli Lilly. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal, such as diarrhea, nausea, constipation and vomiting, and were generally mild to moderate in severity. Eli Lilly's Zepbound works by imitating two naturally produced gut hormones called GLP-1 and GIP. GLP helps reduce food intake and appetite. GIP, which also suppresses appetite, may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat.

A good overview of this Ozempic phenomena if you have not been following. https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0qijsxLd9QvGe3cwWBNAwk reply Snoozle 2 hours agoprevFrom reading about this and Ozempic it appears the main functionality is reducing appetite / blood sugar spikes which results in weight loss. I am curious for those who are using it who have traditionally had a relatively poor diet (refined carbs, sugars, etc), has it changed what foods are desirable or does it simply reduce the amount eaten? In addition, when using these products and switching to a healthy diet such as high protein, which already typically affects satiety, does it cause the inability to eat an adequate amount of calories to function properly? reply UI_at_80x24 2 hours agoparentI was diagnosed with Diabetes 2 years ago. As soon as I found out I immediately changed my diet. 0 carbs My blood sugar would still go too high. My fasting blood sugar (first reading in the morning after waking up. \"12+hr fasting\") was often the highest of the day. I spent the next 14 months trying different drugs to mitigate my blood sugar levels. So one day out of desperation I asked my Doctor if i could try ozempic. It worked INCREDIBLY well. I started adding carbs back into my diet. My blood sugar stayed in good shape. I started loosing weight too. Before Ozempic and going 0-carbs I lost ~20lbs over 14 months. After taking Ozempic I have lost ~80lbs. I still STRONGLY desire sugar/sugary foods. My cravings for bread is really bad too. Ozempic controlled my sugar so well that I have been able to add carbs back into my life. reply sfjailbird 52 minutes agorootparentIs it even possible to have high blood sugar while eating zero carbs? You could be catabolising muscle mass but that would be a case of extreme malnutrition and/or type 1 diabetes. These drugs fix symptoms only, and only for ad long as you keep using them. They have adverse effects, and probably well beyond the published ones. Most signs point to T2D being caused by insulin resistance, which builds up through bad diet and lifestyle. You can 'fix' symptoms by forcing the body to pump out more insulin, but science and common sense would indicate that this could end up worse off in the long run. reply advisedwang 15 minutes agorootparentYou can eat fat and get energy from that. reply djur 28 minutes agorootparentprev> probably well beyond the published ones What is this claim based on? reply talldatethrow 1 hour agorootparentprevMy dad was like you.

He's off the 3 meds he was on. reply wil421 1 hour agorootparentI trust the other poster who worked with his doctor rather than a juice poster.

At wakeup there's the \"dawn effect\" where glucose rises/ketones fall. What diet did you really try? Keto diet is known to ~easily fix T2D. A good company that can do that is virtahealth.com. The only way to quit drugs (sugar) is to no take drugs at all, not take less drugs. Source: I do keto diet but for other reasons. I was addicted to carbs, but not fat, and am no more. I would end up as T2D in 10-20 years though.

Yes, I know quitting drugs is impossible for many people. When you have serious issues, you need a serious professional. reply nox101 2 hours agoparentprevI am curious too. I'm not \"obese\" by the medical defs (84kg, 177cm, 50s) but I could eat forever and constantly and I find that every time I finish some small amount of work (need to switch to the next issue) I get up and walk to the refrigerator looking for a snack. I generally keep from overeating by just not having any junk food nearby (though that's harder at work) and almost no calorie laden drinks. I don't feel hungry, I just seem to love eating. So I wonder if Ozempic would have any affect if all it does is remove my appetite since it \"feels\" like I don't have one most of the time. reply efitz 2 hours agorootparent> I just seem to love eating Or it could be compulsive behavior, which can be diagnosed and treated either with counseling or medication. reply steveBK123 1 hour agorootparentYes, the psychology of eating is generally under explored topic. Some of the most obese people I knew had serious psychological wounds that they never healed. Personally I end up feeling the opposite - I can eat the same weekday lunch for days in a row, and often get a sense of boredom of food before fullness. I enjoy food, but I also enjoy lots of other things.. and not every bite/meal needs to be a work of culinary art. Italians would probably find this sacrilege. For me there's a sense of food fitting a function during the week - nutrient/calories, versus going out to dinner on weekend for the social/enjoyment aspects. reply sk11001 2 hours agoparentprevThe changes are in quantity and quality of food - it basically gives me self control around food which I've never experienced before. reply joshstrange 2 hours agorootparentFrom what I understand about Ozempic and friends is that it's not meant for super long-term use (I can't remember the exact time, like months to a year at most). Do you feel like that's reasonable? As in, do you feel like this is letting you form better habits that will continue after you stop using it? Or do you even have a feel for that (probably hard to guess how you will feel when you are off it)? reply djur 24 minutes agorootparentThere have been long-term studies of semaglutide much longer than a year. I'm not aware of any finding that indicates that long-term use should be avoided. There is some indication that the weight loss plateaus within the first several years for most people, but the weight control and blood sugar control effects are persistent. reply lr4444lr 2 hours agoparentprevdoes it cause the inability to eat an adequate amount of calories to function properly IANAD, but anecdotally it has been seen that a substantial - and arguably worrisome - amount of the weight loss is in lean body mass[0], so probably. GLP-1 agonists are for many obese and at-risk diabetics a worthwhile trade-off. Losing that last pesky 10 lbs. because you don't want to give up your daily 500 calorie latte? Probably not.

We actually have the miracle ‚Äúweight-loss pill‚Äù we‚Äôve always dreamed of. I get it, not actually a pill, but the point is there appears to be a straightforward way to attain a healthy weight that will work for a large proportion of people. Some possible drawbacks‚Ä¶ affordability - if it‚Äôs $1K/mo, it‚Äôs actually not feasible for a large proportion of people. maintaining - seems like you probably have to keep taking the drug forever to maintain the benefit. That is, if you stop, the weight comes back. negative long-term consequences? - It‚Äôs great to hear about the positive consequences of this, but since it appears you have to take the drug long-term, what are the negative consequences to doing so? Personally, I‚Äôm a couple months into a diet to get to a healthy weight (a light-weight form of calorie counting). It‚Äôs working (yay), but if I don‚Äôt do it just right I end up hungry for significant periods of time. That‚Äôs miserable, and if it happens too much I probably can‚Äôt maintain the diet. A miracle weight-loss drug sure is looking attractive right now. reply insane_dreamer 1 hour agoparentOr, we could change our lifestyle and stop eating so much of the highly processed foods that make most of us obese in the first place. Again, we're trying to fix the symptom instead of dealing with the root cause -- because we don't want to give up our Mountain Dew and Frito Lay. reply rincebrain 32 minutes agorootparentThe problem is that for some people, it's not just \"make better choices\" - there's various research that shows once you made those poor choices, or had them made for you when younger, some of the marks that leaves on your brain's expectations last. Various people have remarked on how they've tried avoiding large classes of food that might be \"unhealthy\" and exercised intensely, and nothing changed for them without this. To say nothing of, as the other poster said, how much time+money it can be to avoid, particularly when you've not got much spare income, so the difference might mean not having to skip a meal this week to afford your medication, even if it might be lead-filled or the equivalent that'll harm you over time (and not just directly, in money saved - making your own rounded meals costs a bunch of time, and sometimes upfront costs, and if you're that low on resources, you might not have that time to spare.) I would agree the correct way to mitigate this is to do things like ban HFCS, among other things, and start aggressively researching the harms of anything remotely sweetener or addictive behavior-forming in foods, because if you remove the thing that triggers an excessive \"MORE\" response in some people, you better believe you're starting whack-a-mole with food companies finding other addictives that secretly cause your toes to fall off in 20 years but taste 5000x as sweet, or something. reply illiac786 15 minutes agorootparentprevIt‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúyou could learn 12h a day Japanese and be fluent in months instead on relying on crap google translate‚Äù. Some can easily learn languages, for others it‚Äôs super hard. Same for changing eating habits. For these people ozempic is the achievable goal, far better that the status quo. reply djur 18 minutes agorootparentprev\"Availability of hyperpalatable foods\" and \"urge to eat hyperpalatable foods to excess\" are both prior causes to \"eating hyperpalatable foods to excess\", even if neither of them are a root cause (and I don't think the root cause can be addressed). GLP-1 agonists address both symptoms and causes. reply skrtskrt 1 hour agorootparentprevyou would have to fix the entire system of food availability. we are still programmed to pack on and store energy as soon as it's available. it gets harder and hard to constantly make good choices as you go down the income ladder not just due to the food environment but also because people on the whole just cognitively cannot make these decisions optimally all the time when they are tired, stressed, and overworked. reply blackeyeblitzar 1 hour agoparentprev> negative long-term consequences? - It‚Äôs great to hear about the positive consequences of this, but since it appears you have to take the drug long-term, what are the negative consequences to doing so? The GLP drugs very commonly cause GI issues. It isn‚Äôt clear yet if those effects can be permanent but they do remain at least for a while after stopping treatment. reply Nzen 52 minutes agorootparentThe npr segment I heard yesterday [0] called out nausea and muscle loss among actual users.

And you're full for longer as it slows down the passage of food in your system. Of course, it is up to the user to 1) exercise and 2) eat healthy. reply illiac786 14 minutes agorootparentDepends for whom, some here seem to continue having cravings, see other comments. reply skrtskrt 1 hour agorootparentprevif you have paid attention to any article in the last year, one of the primary functions of these drugs is reducing the cravings. reply ddorian43 45 minutes agorootparentTo all food or just bad food? And how does it do that? I saw in this thread that it reduces cravings to fatty food which is bad news. reply djur 13 minutes agorootparentThere's a lot of information you can find if you spend some time to do the research before making declarations on the topic, but studies have shown significant reductions in alcohol consumption, for one thing. Anecdotally, multiple people I know who are on GLP-1 agonists have said that they feel much less of a desire to drink and have much less when they do. reply rincebrain 28 minutes agorootparentprevI believe the anecdotes I've seen were about people on this drug finding that they thought about formerly favorite unhealthy foods and viscerally recoiled at the idea of eating them. My speculation is that it's a gut biota change driving the change in cravings, but I'm not sure there's much research on the mechanisms involved yet, since these drugs are very new, comparatively. A very small study apparently suggested it ameliorated some of the numbness to intense flavors that the obese have been shown to have in previous studies, so maybe I'm completely off base. reply paulpauper 1 hour agoparentprevYeah.

Tirzepatide is newer and more effective, otherwise they're very similar - once a week injection, significantly reduces appetite, the use cases are diabetes and weight loss.

I‚Äôm sure there is quite a bit of spend in there for diabetes/CVD/and other obesity related health issues, but the bigger impact would be on Medicare spending (65+ year olds), which is a federal expense. Edit: note that the weight loss drugs may not decrease healthcare spend. For example, if it leads to more people living longer and utilizing other more expensive healthcare such as dialysis or cancer treatments, then the net effect will be an increase. For example, 25% of all Medicare spend is just for dialysis or kidney related issues. https://www.kidney.org/sites/default/files/fy2023_kidney_dis... reply warkdarrior 2 hours agoparentprev> Will insurance costs come down if the US becomes healthier? Health insurance prices in US are not related to demand, but to how much the market can bear.

Drug patents do last 20 years (in the US), but the patent date is always some time before the medication is first sold. You also don't get a new patent for finding a new application of the same drug. So a diabetes treatment drug that's now used for weight loss without sufficient modification will expire at the same time as it originally would have even if it gets a new marketing name. Different formulations based on the original drug could get a new patent, though. reply comfortabledoug 2 hours agorootparentprevPatent for semaglutide is expiring starting next year reply daft_pink 2 hours agoprevI use it.

It's really expensive to be obese, have diabetes, cancer, heart disease... reply CamperBob2 2 hours agoparentIt's really expensive to be obese, have diabetes, cancer, heart disease... From the insurance companies' perspective, what's really expensive is living too long, rather than dying early. My family has gold-plated health insurance by most standards, but it doesn't cover Ozempic. You'd think they would hand out Ozempic like candy, but evidently they're afraid it will work too well. reply ribosometronome 1 hour agorootparentIt's also a $12k a year medication that potentially half their customers would want and qualify for under if obesity is qualifying alone. I can understand why they'd quake in fear at the cost. It's a real shame as these drugs will course correct the obesity epidemic and give millions of people decades of life they probably would not have gotten. reply paulpauper 2 hours agoprevThis is the closet thing to a wonder drug for the 21st century. You can see the transformation ...people who used to be obese seeing the fat melt off, when nothing else seemed to work. reply toephu2 2 hours agoparentBut what are the long-term side effects? You don't get something for nothing. There is no such thing as a magic pill that makes you magically lose weight without any consequences. reply GavinMcG 2 hours agorootparent> You don‚Äôt get something for nothing If that were true about the human condition in the same way that it‚Äôs true for conservation of mass, we wouldn't be living longer and healthier lives than our forebears. Yet here we are. Of course we should be aware of side-effects. But there‚Äôs no law of nature that says there have to be any serious ones. reply lr4444lr 2 hours agorootparentwe wouldn't be living longer and healthier lives than our forebears Take out infectious disease, post-partum maternal deaths, no sanitation, and obvious lifestyle choices like smoking, and are we really living healthier lives than prior generations? I'm not so convinced. reply semaglp1 5 minutes agorootparentNot sure why you're getting down-voted, it's a common meme for people to think everyone just died by their 40s. It seems like if you made it to 40 you often could be living into your 70s [1] throughout much of human history. Now I'll take our modern scientific advances over not having them. Give me modern sanitation, surgery, antibiotics, and vaccines for sure. But I'm not sure I'd call the way many American elders around me are living in their 70s to be healthy lives. Many lack mobility, are obese, are on a fistful of prescription drugs daily, and have constant pain. Except for the ones that ate well and in moderation, didn't drink much, and exercised their entire lives. I just hope people take these GPL-1 drugs but also get their bodies moving (particularly strength training). [1] https://www.sapiens.org/biology/human-lifespan-history/ reply semaglp1 2 hours agorootparentprevThere's some evidence of bone density being affected negatively, which could be prevented with exercise: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle... I've also read anecdotal reports of skin burning sensations from people that take it. If people can take it to lose weight and curb food addiction while also beginning strength training for long term health, I think that's a positive. reply djur 8 minutes agorootparentIn any case, long-term obesity leads to (and is worsened by) decreased exercise, which results in decreased bone density and muscle loss. There might be an argument for avoiding GLP-1 agonists for slightly overweight people, but for obese people it seems unlikely that the risks outweigh the benefits. reply panarky 2 hours agorootparentprevThe long-term is a luxury that healthy people can worry about. Obese people are also at much greater risk for diabetes, heart failure, kidney failure, liver failure, depression, anxiety and suicide. If a drug can add 20 years to my lifespan, I'll take it and worry about long-term side effects later. Because without the drug, there's a good chance I'd die from something else before reaching the long term. reply __MatrixMan__ 2 hours agorootparentprevThere's some concern about how it affects the retina: https://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/update-on-semaglutide-ris... reply djur 4 minutes agorootparentYeah, because there's a (previously observed) paradoxical effect where decreasing blood glucose levels can accelerate the progress of diabetic retinopathy. reply davikr 2 hours agorootparentprevWhy couldn't there be? There are magic pills that lower your blood pressure without any consequence. reply paulmd 20 minutes agorootparentprevGLP-1 drugs have been studied for decades and the side effects are incredibly low/small. The bigger problem is frankly the reaction you display, that even if the side effects were actually zero that people feel that‚Äôs ‚Äúunfair‚Äù and that others shouldn‚Äôt be taking a pill to do something their personal body chemistry doesn‚Äôt do properly. Your thyroid medication is really a moral failing, you see. Just eat less and your weight will remain healthy. reply petesergeant 2 hours agorootparentprev> You don't get something for nothing This is medicine, not witchcraft. reply dgfitz 1 hour agorootparentIt‚Äôs actually chemistry, and given that we don‚Äôt really know how a lot of the human body subsystems interact in 2024, it‚Äôs closer to witchcraft than medicine. reply standardUser 2 hours agoparentprevGabapentin may be a wonder drug, helping with heretofore barely-treatable conditions and the ravages of addiction. Weight lose drugs are just a shortcut for something that is possibly for the vast majority of people without any drugs. Don't get me wrong, they seem great! But a drug that can help with seizures, nerve pain, alcoholism and anxiety sounds a little more \"wondery\" to me. reply meany 2 hours agorootparentI don‚Äôt think the data supports that it is possible for the majority of people.

It's from 1993. reply tyrefd 2 hours agoparentprevThe wonder here is effective brain manipulation rather than fat melting. These drugs are chemically induced intermittent fasting. I‚Äôm okay with people saying ‚Äúthese drugs force people into healthy eating habits‚Äù but the weight loss itself is merely a symptom of the healthy eating habits that would be healthier on the body when done with discipline rather than chemically altering your digestion. reply raincom 2 hours agorootparentHumans are biochemical machines. Hormones (chemicals) regulate many systems in humans. So, you want people to eat less and work out more, when hormones, or biochemical subsystems, are messed up? reply tyrefd 2 hours agorootparentI wholly respect the difficulty, and I respect this may be some people‚Äôs best or only solution to what ails them. I have, and do, suffer from lack of discipline in facets of my own life. I just want to be honest about these drugs. reply djur 2 hours agorootparentprevAnecdotally, the people I know who have been taking GLP-1 agonists have not been following eating patterns consistent with \"intermittent fasting\". They're just eating less (especially snacking). reply tyrefd 2 hours agorootparentIF is a catchall for eating less rather than any specific the strict scheduling that influencers peddle. reply ctoth 2 hours agorootparentprev> when done with discipline I suppose that the drug also cures people with Parkinson's [0] through ...

Is there a better word that I can use in the future to ensure that my message is one of support free from misinformation? I feel your link and the other studies showing it helps people with various other addictions is evidence against the drug being a ‚Äúfat melter‚Äù. reply Modified3019 1 hour agorootparentWhen it comes to words like discipline or willpower, they are typically a signal that the poster is about to: 1. Ignore the continual and catastrophic failure of the idea that we can will ourselves out of an increasing crisis 2. Pat themselves on the back for their smug victim blaming Hence the negative reaction. I don‚Äôt have an alternative word for you to use. Humans at a population level have severe limits on what they can deal with. This is why tech companies use dark patterns, because exploiting and abusing people until they can‚Äôt put up resistance works fantastically. Suggesting that the real solution to mass exploitation is just to have the discipline to not be exploited would and should receive a negative reaction. Ultimately, the solution to obesity is to make the fix as easy to obtain as the primary causes of the problem. Can‚Äôt wait for a gambling and (working) smoking vaccine. reply teqsun 2 hours agorootparentprevI see it as a replacement for invasive surgical methods like lap-band surgery. reply petesergeant 2 hours agorootparentprev> The wonder here is effective brain manipulation rather than fat melting. Yes > These drugs are chemically induced intermittent fasting. No, they're a type of calorie restriction, as is intermittent fasting. reply tyrefd 1 hour agorootparentOkay, we agree. This just seems painfully pedantic. > Intermittent fasting is any of various meal timing schedules that cycle between voluntary fasting (or reduced calorie intake) and non-fasting over a given period.[1][2] Methods of intermittent fasting include alternate-day fasting,[3] periodic fasting, such as the 5:2 diet, and daily time-restricted eating.[1][4] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting reply djur 1 minute agorootparentIntermittent fasting is different than calorie restriction. There are calorie-restricted diets where you eat small amounts constantly throughout the day (this used to be the go-to recommendation of doctors). Intermittent fasting doesn't even necessarily entail calorie restriction. leovander 2 hours agoparentprevHopefully they reduce the cost overall. As soon as people are taken off it, whether that be because they finished their trial or they get out priced, appetite shoots right back to what it was before and the weight comes back with it unless the person changed their habits. reply flakiness 3 minutes agorootparentLong term the patent expires and it becomes a generic. That's I think when the real transformation starts. reply ryandrake 2 hours agorootparentprevThis seems to be a great outcome if you're the drugmaker. You don't want your medicine to cure the patient, otherwise they'll stop buying it. I bet if they found an alternate drug that worked permanently after N doses, they'd bury it and never productize it. reply steveBK123 2 hours agorootparentLove a good conspiracy & not a biologist / chemist, but I don't thing such a drug is even possible in our current state of technology. Treatments that are \"one (or N) & done\" tend to be surgical procedures which physical change your body or vaccines which train your immune system (which has a sort of viral memory bank). Most other regular drug treatments are introducing chemicals into the body which your body consumes/breaks down/etc. The body is always self repairing, replacing cells, etc. As a layperson, I conceptualize altering brain chemistry via a drug is a temporary thing the way adjusting your pools chemistry is. You have to constantly replenish with new chemicals as everything is constantly breaking down and changing. reply ahahahahah 2 hours agorootparentprevYep! That's exactly why vaccines don't exist. reply tiffanyh 1 hour agoprev [‚Äì] Is this \"Correlation vs Causation\"? Seems like diabetes is strongly correlated to your weight.
