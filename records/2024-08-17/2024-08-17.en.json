Why does posting there make a user a “problem”? Who’s the judge of what’s a “problem” and what are the criteria, I wonder. reply luuurker 5 hours agorootparent> Why “stop linking to X”? As someone without a Twitter/X account, their links are bad. I can only see the first post of a chain, can't see replies, etc. Mastodon is better in that regard. This has nothing to do with the content of the platform, Musk, etc, btw. It's just the fact that now it's a bit hostile for logged out users/people without accounts. It used to be fine, but now it hides content, which is bad for me. reply BLKNSLVR 5 hours agorootparentYep, exactly. Twitter makes no sense at all from the perspective of a non-user. Posts are all over the place, no coherent order. It only motivates me to avoid the platform. reply RHSeeger 5 hours agorootparentprev> It used to be fine It was always awful, in my opinion. Twitter does a good job at letting people publish \"sound bytes\"; little bits of what's on their mind. Past that (into longer form and discussion) it has never been good. reply luuurker 4 hours agorootparentRight, it was never a good platform for longer posts, but before at least you could try to follow the different posts. Now, public links only show one post and that's it. reply KronisLV 5 hours agorootparentprev> Why “stop linking to X”? Clicking on almost any of the UI elements leads to a log in prompt, without showing anything else. For people without accounts (or those who don't want to make one), that's probably not functionally different from dropping a link to some forum that requires registration, albeit in this case I guess at least the main post is visible. The Mastodon link in comparison has the discussion visible up front, which is nice to see! Now whether the fediverse is popular enough to actually have good discussions, that's a bit harder to say, but at least it's something! I think Facebook also had similar issues, where it gates a lot of things behind a login prompt, quite user hostile, though also understandable why they'd do it that way. reply RHSeeger 5 hours agorootparentprevReading anything on Twitter is (subjectively) miserable. The platform is good only for since thoughts / sound bytes; not long articles (spread across many posts) and discussions. It's _worse_ if you don't use an account so you can't see anything but the first post... but it's awful even if you can see the whole thing. I don't know who was the first moron who decided to post the first \"long form writeup\" on a platform that only supports blurbs... but I am absolutely amazed that people thought it was a good idea and followed suit. reply hkt 5 hours agorootparentprevThe UX to people without accounts is actively hostile. That's why. If someone was telling me to look up information from a print edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica from the 1970s, I'd have the same problem: it is an absurd thing to ask of me because there are better, more frictionless ways to obtain the information. reply hobs 5 hours agorootparentprev1. You will notice Hacker News does not require a login to view content - this simple approach is a big reason why twitter links are looked down upon. The platform used to foster simple sharing, and now does not. It is in effect, telling you to stop sharing things publicly and only with twitter users. 2. Because you are basically linking to a deep link in the dark web. 3. We all get to make our own decisions, and the person calling out shitty websites that you should not bring to the group has my support. reply jasonlotito 5 hours agorootparentprevWhy stop linking there? X hides threads. If you click a link, you can't see a thread. If you are logged in you can see it, but you can't see it if you aren't logged in. So, you can one little post, and frequently you miss a lot of other information in the replies. See ANY post on where the person is posting more than one single post. Basically, if you link to a post there, the person reading it usually won't get the full story. Why is posting there make the user a problem? Because, if the user is trying to communicate something, they are choosing a platform that isn't interested in making it effective at communication. A closed off community isn't the town square it claims to be. If you are communication on that site, you can be sure people directed aren't getting the full story. Who's the judge? Me. I am the judge of what a problem is. So is the parent poster you were replying to. They are also a judge. It's odd that you hand off opinions to others and don't make your own. reply chrisan 7 hours agorootparentprevYou got me to click, thinking there would be some kind of insight, but then I was greeted with people arguing over \"last night\" vs \"that night\" typo. reply luuurker 5 hours agorootparentHumans will always be humans, independently of the platform. :-P In any case, at least we can see the replies and other posts from the account without having to create an account. Still better than Twitter/X in my view. reply justaj 3 hours agorootparent> Humans will always be humans, independently of the platform. :-P While true, I'd much rather read discussions on HN than say X or even Reddit these days. reply seanthemon 6 hours agorootparentprevI had a good laugh at this, how ridiculous reply fortran77 4 hours agorootparentprevI did the same thing (and then downvoted the guy who suggested it was better!) It was much worse than the discourse on Twitter, with folks hurling insults at each other and saying things like \"don't turn this into [X]itter\". reply RicoElectrico 8 hours agorootparentprev@dang reply ben_w 4 hours agorootparentFYI, that does nothing: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27545206 reply vollbrecht 8 hours agoprevThat's why AppStore monopolize are such a chore. There is no independent judicial authority if something between Google and a App Provider goes wrong. Google playing legeslative, executive and judiciary in one entity. There is a reason most people in democratic countries don't like it, if there country has all the powers in one hand. At the same time it seams to be accepted for cooperation, as long as there are big enough. reply grishka 7 hours agoparentThis isn't as much of a problem on Android because it allows installing apks. There's plenty of apps that couldn't possibly be allowed in Google Play that are distributed using alternative means. It's a much more serious problem with iOS, where if Apple doesn't like your app, your service, your policies, or even your attitude, you just aren't getting your app out to your users, period. But we'll see where EU DMA takes this. reply rvnx 5 hours agorootparentIt's about distribution and being visible. If you are not on the Play Store you lose the majority of your installations. It's like a musician who is not on YouTube and not on Spotify. Or a website that is not on Google Search. reply grishka 4 hours agorootparentIMO not quite. Here's how I see it: - Generic utility apps, the kind that you would search by what they do, like an audio player, an image converter, or a file manager — yes, it works for them like you say. - Those free to play mobile games everyone knows and loves (no). They buy stupid amount of ads to get people to install them. They may get some installations thanks the app stores themselves, e.g. from the top charts, assuming they get high enough there. So app stores do play a role in their visibility, but a limited one. And this is where it ends. - Apps for IRL services, like getting around (taxi/scooter rental/car sharing), or ordering food, or many other similar things. They get popular because people see their logos around them all the dang time, often together with QR codes with download links. They also often buy ads. Sometimes people recommend them to each other. App stores don't play any significant role for these. - Apps for something you already use. Like your home utilities, or your bank, or some sort of \"smart\" device you got, or loyalty programs. Again, you don't discover these thanks to app stores, you usually install them because that company says \"we have an app, get it here\". - Social/collaboration apps, the kind that are useless without people you know also using them. No one searches app stores for \"social media\" or \"messaging\" or \"calls\". People recommend them to each other. People see that their friends are on there and get on there too. Again, app stores don't do much here. reply 998244353 4 hours agorootparentYou're right that discoverability is not really the issue. However, I still agree with the GP that if you are not on the Play Store, you lose most of your installations. If someone has already discovered your app and can't find it on the Play Store, they are more likely to assume that it's not supported on their phone, unavailable in their region or whatever. Even if you explicitly tell them to just download the APK, most people will not do that. Keep in mind that the average user probably doesn't even know that you can install apps from outside the Play Store. Or even if they guess that it's probably possible, they might well perceive it as complicated and sketchy. reply grishka 3 hours agorootparentI don't understand how does one come to this conclusion. In my own experience, most people will do what you ask them to do as long as your instructions are clear enough. Downloading and installing an apk on an Android phone is no different than downloading and running an exe on a Windows PC, which is something people do all the time. No one perceives Play Store as inherently more trustworthy. I know many non-tech people who have and use sideloaded apps on their phones. Edit: it might be different for younger generations who grew up with modern smartphones. reply danhor 4 hours agorootparentprevWhile people don't discover these apps on the play store, they will hear of the App, search on the App/Play Store and install it. If they can't find it by typing the app name into the search bar there, they won't install it. I doubt most users will, even when given the link to an .apk, install it. Either because they are discouraged by the alarming prompts (in my opinion a tradeoff that is unfortunately worth it) or because they get lost. reply DaiPlusPlus 4 hours agorootparentprev> It's like a musician who is not on YouTube and not on Spotify. There are plenty of musicians who are perfectly happy not being on YouTube or Spotify. It's almost like a protest, at this point - and I don't mean like a boycott either. reply throwaway743 4 hours agorootparentprevAs someone who just started a business and released my first android app a few weeks ago, you couldn't be more right. Not only is the fate of your app in the hands of the Play Store, but also in the hands of their testers. Just had a critical bug in an update release 5 days ago, affecting fresh installs. I immediately fixed it after a friend notified me, pushed the fixed update, only to wait till yesterday to get rejected due to a super minor ui issue. Then finally got approval this morning. Typically I waited 30 min for approval, 2 hrs the longest. During that time I reached out to their non-existent customer support, messaged their \"help forum\", called any number I could find, finally resorted to randomly messaging employees on LinkedIn out of desperation. Nothing. And when you try to get support through their help options, it's a gamble as to whether or not the help option you select is going to give you an error. Not to mention any number you call ends with \"please visit support.google.com. thanks for calling\". In the meantime, I had ~300+ uninstalls out of the ~1200 I had, and risked my 4.8 rating tanking and sinking my chances of success before I even really started. That's just my story. There are people who are facing even worse rn dealing with them and have been waiting for weeks. reply mook 2 hours agorootparentprevYou can't show up in Android Auto unless you're distributed through the Play store (third party things like F-Droid and side loading means your app doesn't show in the car). reply MobiusHorizons 1 minute agorootparentGood point, that makes a nontrivial difference for apps like organic maps. I know I have used it for offline navigation over CarPlay several times before. blackeyeblitzar 3 hours agorootparentprevDistribution is everything. Controlling distribution through defaults (play store already installed), barriers (pop ups warning you that installing other apps is risky), etc is monopolistic. reply cube00 7 hours agorootparentprevGood luck getting a regular consumer to agree to all the scary warnings presented when you do that. reply grishka 7 hours agorootparentOn Android, there isn't really a scary warning. You have to allow whatever app you're installing the apk from to install apps form \"unknown sources\". That's it. You only have to do it once per source. On iOS, I'm sure the EU regulators will demand that Apple at least tone down their warnings. reply withinboredom 7 hours agorootparentprevI didn't even read the warnings to install fortnite, but it seemed Apple tried to make it as confusing as possible. Click install, go to settings, white list the provider, go back to the browser, click back to try installing again ... and then finally, click \"yes I am sure\" then click \"yes I am sure\" like 3 more times. So complicated. reply palata 5 hours agoparentprevFeels unrelated to me. The problem here is that the entity that owns Google Maps also owns the Google Play Store, and uses their ownership of the Google Play Store to favour Google Maps versus competitors. Even without a monopoly, it should be illegal for the owner of a popular app store to promote their products like this. They just need to get big fat fines when they do it. But of course, \"it was an unfortunate mistake\". Or we should just split them: Google Maps could be out of Google. reply fmajid 4 hours agorootparentThe answer to that is \"structural separation\". Remove even the possibility of conflict of interest by forcing divestiture. reply eitally 5 hours agorootparentprevI don't think it's true that the Google Play Store favors Google-created apps. In fact, while it may have happened, I can't even remember a time that the Play Store recommended a Google app to me. reply bmicraft 3 hours agorootparentGoogle will never \"accidentally\" or even because of a justified policy remove any of their own apps from the store. That's a big favor right there. reply palata 4 hours agorootparentprevIs that sarcasm? You forgot the /s. reply theginger 5 hours agoparentprevWhen app stores act in a way that puts their own interest ahead of the user it harms security, especially when there is no transparency. If I want this app I am now being sent to download an APK, I lose all the protection of the app store. If they cry wolf enough people will get used to doing that. Then when something comes along that is harmful and they want to yank it genuinely to protect users, people will still download the apk. reply _heimdall 5 hours agoparentprevDo you really want the government being deeply involved in how every company defines and enforces their own terms of use? In this case I'm not sure why Google would pull Organic Maps. That doesn't mean we need the government playing a role in defining ever company's terms of service, deciding when they're broken, and enforcing the punishment. How would that even scale? reply graemep 5 hours agorootparentThey already are. Most countries have consumer laws that limit terms and conditions. The same in many other areas (residential renting in many countries, exclusions for negligence that causes injuries or death,....). Most countries have competition laws that also restrict what companies can do. That is the point here. We need need government intervention when the market lacks competition. reply _heimdall 5 hours agorootparentMaybe I misread the GP comment, but there is a big difference in governments defining guard rails for what isn't allowed in any T&Cs and governments being involved directly in every T&Cs. reply graemep 4 hours agorootparentYes, but providing fair appeals does not require the government to be involved in evert T & C, just requiring things such as approvals be carried out impartially, and with some channel of appeal. Something like an Ombudsman scheme for app stores would do it. reply _heimdall 3 hours agorootparentThat seems reasonable enough. Down with governments and regulations and all that nonsense, but in reality I don't see a problem with governments setting reasonable guard rails for what any T&Cs can or must include. reply palata 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's exactly how it works. If some behaviour is anti-competitive, it is the role of the government to correct it. > In this case I'm not sure why Google would pull Organic Maps. Exactly. Someone competent should decide whether that is an anti-competitive move or not. Noting that a \"mistake\" may be anti-competitive and may deserve a fine. That someone is a government. reply _heimdall 4 hours agorootparentI may have just misunderstood the GP. I read it as wanting the government to directly work on defining and enforcing Google's terms of service rather than this being an anticompetitive concern. reply shaky-carrousel 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, I absolutely do, thanks. reply _heimdall 4 hours agorootparentHow would you see that scaling? Are you talking about governments defining what can't be in any terms of service? Or would you prefer to see governments directly working to both define Google's rules, determining when an app breaks them, and having the government decide when to pull an app? reply uberman 3 hours agorootparentDoes any company like google offer support or dispute resolution that \"scales\"? reply _heimdall 3 hours agorootparentI would assume so, yes. There must be at least a few meeting the bar of \"any.\" reply sam_lowry_ 9 hours agoprevJust used it yesterday. It's a great little app to browse OSM data as it is. Much better than Google Maps at finding walkable trails. If only it had the features of overpass turbo, e.g. searching for points tagged with specific attributes. reply lioeters 8 hours agoparentI agree, Organic Maps is often better than Google Maps for walkable trails, bicycle and hiking paths. I found there are some paths mapped on OSM that are not mapped at all on GMaps. On the other hand, GMaps is better for up-to-date commercial data like stores and their opening hours. Its navigation system is better too. As much as I'd like to drop all Google services from my life, Maps is too useful to let go. reply alx_the_new_guy 7 hours agorootparentYou can download one of the dozens of OSM-editing apps like: - streetcomplete - vespucci - everydoor and either add that information yourself or leave a note for other people reply dmd 7 hours agorootparentIf I had the information I wouldn’t be looking it up. reply palata 5 hours agorootparentI guess the point of the parent is that if more people were contributing information, then you would get it from OSM. reply failbuffer 4 hours agorootparentFor relatively static info, sure. For real time bus/rail status you need integrations to countless public transit systems. For stuff like store times, etc, you need sufficient market power so that business owners are incentived to provide that info. reply zaik 3 hours agorootparentI added/updated hundreds of opening hours to OSM. A few people updating the opening hours to the shops they go to is already worth a lot. reply sam_lowry_ 7 hours agorootparentprevOrganicMaps lets you also add points and attributes to OSM. reply Aachen 6 hours agorootparentI seem to remember they have a history of incorrect tags or tag combinations being applied by their software though. Not sure what the current state is but may be something to look into before using OrganicMaps as a mapping application when there's other good options reply carlosjobim 5 hours agorootparentprevWhy should he/she labour for free for the shop owners? reply lolc 4 hours agorootparentI sure wish shop owners updated their hours. But in the end OSM is better if I do it, and others do it. It's called collaboration. reply jwalton 5 hours agorootparentprevHow do you think google maps got such a good database of these things? When I last used it, Google maps used to actively ask you for this sort of information. reply lolc 4 hours agorootparentAnd the tragic thing is that Google the monopolist rides on people's helpful inclinations then turns around and sells their contributions. I actively avoid contributing to that corp. Not even marking spam. Let them drown in the fruits of their own incentives. reply carlosjobim 4 hours agorootparentprevThe shop owners also put their hours onto Google Maps, or paid somebody to do it. You shouldn't labour for free for Google either. Even if you managed to help a shop get hundreds or thousands of new customers by updating their online information, they wouldn't even give you a cup of coffee if you asked. More likely they'd spit in your face. For most physical businesses that are open to the public, correct information on map services are by far their most important advertising. Yet, they neglect this and spend thousands on billboards, social media, radio spots, etc. If they are failing as business owners, that's their own problem. reply sleepless 6 hours agorootparentprevThis largly depends on the location you are referring to. In many german places / cities, OSM data is often more accurate than Google Maps, even for commercial infos like opening hours. In the end it is up to people to ensure data is up-to-date. Apps like StreetComplete can help with that. Organic Maps also allows for some editing. reply rcMgD2BwE72F 6 hours agorootparent>StreetComplete I much prefer Every Door, especially for updating opening hours and any kind of place details. Have you tried it? reply drpixie 6 hours agorootparentprevAustralia \"up-to-date commercial data like stores and their opening hours\" is about all that appears on Google Maps :( reply sebtron 6 hours agorootparentprevGMaps is usable from a web browser, although definitely less performant than the native app. reply hedora 5 hours agorootparentIt gets worse at that on a regular basis, at least on iOS, where they can’t factory install the background tracking daemons. reply LtWorf 7 hours agorootparentprev> GMaps is better for up-to-date commercial data like stores and their opening hours Not in my country. They don't even keep track of national holidays, and very often keep listing establishments that closed down years ago. Also, you might be standing in front of a restaurant and when asking google maps for nearby restaurants, if that one isn't blessed, you'll get directions to a 3km restaurant instead. reply hnrepostsold 4 hours agorootparentthis is a cognitive bias. it's really interesting. google used to be good, because if the hours were there, someone had put effort in. they were 95% accurate for CONUS. but over the last 6~ years the quality has degraded. Only about 65% accurate now. And to me, that's worse than unuseful, because i can't plan, i need to verify, so i might as well have gone to the store website anyways. also who the heck needs open and close times? if you need that level of precision you need a personal assistant. reply LtWorf 4 hours agorootparent> also who the heck needs open and close times? Uh I do? Not all restaurants are open for both lunch and dinners, and in every country there's different ideas on what's the appropriate time for having a meal. reply beardyw 8 hours agorootparentprevWhat's wrong with OSM itself? reply ah27182 8 hours agorootparentIs OSM good at keeping up-to-date with commercial data? I always thought it wasn’t so good, but maybe I’m wrong reply jbaber 8 hours agorootparentNo. Even though I navigate with Osmand regularly, I must use Gmaps to find stores' existence, address, hours, phone number, url. Gmaps is the yellow pages. Osmand is a map. reply ihatehn 8 hours agorootparentOSM can have those details it just takes a local community on top of keeping things updated. Even Google often relies on users for that stuff. reply hk__2 7 hours agorootparent> OSM can have those details it just takes a local community on top of keeping things updated. Even Google often relies on users for that stuff. Google has an infinitely-larger community; a local community is not sufficient in dense areas where businesses are opening and closing every day. France has the third largest OSM community and yet some neighborhoods of its largest cities are full of outdated businesses. reply SamWhited 7 hours agorootparentInterestingly, in Atlanta I've had the opposite experience. In town OSM always seems to be better (Google has a lot of outdated open hours and the like). Outside of town in the cheaper burbs which is the only place I can afford to live though few people are editing OSM and it's pretty out of date. That being said, I switched to Organic maps years ago. For 90% of places I go, it turns out I go to them repeatedly day-to-day, so I added them to the map the first time and update them when I go there and the hours have changed. Then they're on the map the rest of the time when I need to look up hours or what not so I rarely have anywhere around here that I go to that's not on the map anymore. When I do, I add it and next time it's on there and it works well enough 99% of the time. reply lolc 4 hours agorootparentYou highlight a function of OSM that is hard to get across to people: I can fix the map! For example, bicycle routing in my area was unreliable, because it would try to route me over rough trails. Just adding a few tags improved the experience dramatically. And then it was fixed not only for me, but everybody else too. Meanwhile, other people fixed other annoyances, and the map works better across many areas. Google instead decides to hide things that interest me, and shows sponsored places I don't care for. I have zero recourse. reply hk__2 3 hours agorootparent> Just adding a few tags improved the experience dramatically. This works for routing, but doesn’t apply to businesses: for the bare minimum you have to add one or two tags (type + name), to make that more useful you have to add the opening hours and ideally the website. Now multiply this by 60,000 (the number of businesses in Paris, France). By the time you’ve finished your neighborhood some businesses you checked last month are already closed and some new ones already opened. Go on holidays? Too bad, you have to start over again when you come back. Trust me, I’m contributing almost every day and I can’t keep the pace. reply lolc 2 hours agorootparentYeah the idea that I should keep up with all the shops in the larger area is scary. Luckily, I'm not alone. All I can say is you're doing a good thing by adding regular updates. And I think even partially complete OSM is helpful. If I add just one ATM, that can already help somebody looking for one. That might even be me, when I know it's there somewhere, but not exactly where. reply hnrepostsold 5 hours agorootparentprevnot infinitely larger lol community size absolutely does not matter, it's the activity. a local active community of 2 active persons for every 260 residents is sufficient reply hk__2 2 hours agorootparent> a local active community of 2 active persons for every 260 residents is sufficient That would be huge. For a city with 2M inhabitants, that would mean 8k active contributors. Remember that there are ~40-50k active OSM contributors in the whole world. reply zaik 3 hours agorootparentprevI'd say it's closer to 5 active contributors for a population of 100000. reply hk__2 3 hours agorootparentIn Paris we have ~100 contributors with >100 edits for a population of 2M and 60.8k businesses. Most notes are fixed under a day, infrastructure changes are quick as well, but businesses are often out of date because they change so often that some people don’t take the time to update them. reply LtWorf 7 hours agorootparentprevWell add the information yourself… reply beardyw 8 hours agorootparentprevWe seemed to be talking about trails. Maybe I misunderstood. reply okasaki 7 hours agorootparentprevThough G maps works in a browser, so you don't necessarily need a phone with google services running. reply sebastiennight 5 hours agoparentprevI just wish Organic Maps would revert that new \"feature\" which prompts you for your location again and again multiple times per use, multiple times per day.[0] Guys, if the device has location services disabled, your app should get the hint after I dismiss the prompt for the n!th time.

It has some minor limitations, though: it cannot keep the GPS on when you switch to a different app, and it doesn't do track recording. reply RicoElectrico 7 minutes agorootparentTrack recording is in the works. The reason that it takes so long is that OM devs want it to be polished rather than a slapped together UX trainwreck. That, and the fact current mobile OSes are hostile towards any background activity even if it's justified and lightweight on resources. reply RobotToaster 7 hours agoprevFor companies like google, I feel like the opposite of Hanlon's razor applies, which makes: Never attribute to stupidity that which is adequately explained by malice. reply Rhapso 5 hours agoparentHanlon's razor applies well to situations where social power is relatively even.

Most of big tech today no longer understands why someone would build an app, a business, or a project for reasons other than seeking to extract money from the market. It is ironic, because most of the big tech companies are only as successful because they initially offered products with vision and purpose, rather than as means simply to extract revenue at the lowest cost. They are not entirely wrong to view the market this way. Most apps and projects are built these days primarily as means to extract revenue from the market at a low cost. Sometimes they are so much this that we call them grifts, and there have been many in tech recently, and certainly on the Play Store. But there are still some companies with better values. This is a long way to say that unless an app/project/business/website is evidently monetized, it can probably be assumed it's monetized by selling data or ads. Likely, this assumption was made by the reviewer here, there may even be guidelines about it. To some degree, it would even benefit consumers to do such a reality check too before they buy products and subscribe to services — is this a visionary purpose-driven product, or one that seeks to extract money from me as its primary goal? If latter, how do they do it — in evident ways, or through selling data or ads/influencing? But one must be able to see nuance that not everything in the world is built for the capitalistic objective. Sometimes, cool things are built, art is made, and inventions are made to better the world. Overall, it is a problem that they don't see this nuance which made Google successful in the first place. It is clear across their business, products and services. But I think it is not unexpected. An app shot down because it doesn't grift in an evident way, under an assumption it grifts in a hidden way — it's not the most wrong decision in the world. It just does not demonstrate competence either. reply fmajid 4 hours agorootparentRegarding Maps, Google long ago forfeited the benefit of doubt: https://www.slashgear.com/google-blames-rogue-contractors-fo... reply roter 6 hours agoparentprevs/malice/avarice. reply Viliam1234 5 hours agorootparentThe polite way to say this is \"following the incentives\". reply kibwen 5 hours agoparentprevIncompetence at scale is malice. reply neilv 8 hours agoprevOrganic Maps is nice.

Even if I tap a link accidentally and it opens their website, the address is broken half the time. Instead, I screen shot the address and paste it into another mapping app. However, on android, if the google location services (the spyware half of gmaps) is not installed, then third party apps like uber and lyft, and real world infrastructure access, like ev charging and paying parking meters break. reply yosito 4 hours agoparentprevIf there were a service that could convert Google Maps links to Organic Maps links, I'd never need Google Maps. reply brunoqc 15 minutes agorootparentMaybe check https://f-droid.org/packages/net.retiolus.osm2gmaps/ I don't know if it does what you want or if it's for the reverse. reply maipen 7 hours agoparentprevI think having gmaps is must.

I like waze, but sometimes it just fails to find me a certain place. reply Freak_NL 7 hours agorootparentThat's heavily location and use dependant. Why would Google Maps be better than OpenStreetMap locally downloaded for off-line use into OsmAnd or OrganicMaps? In much of Europe Google Maps can't even compete with OpenStreetMap data as soon as you get to trails, paths, and minor local roads. Besides, if you have a wireless signal, you can always just of the browser with Google Maps. A real backup means having a paper map when hiking, and just following the local road signs when driving. When things really go wrong, Google Maps is just about the last thing to use. reply palata 5 hours agorootparentprev> I like waze, but sometimes it just fails to find me a certain place.

And there's no button to delete developer account either. Double standards. reply clumsysmurf 6 hours agoparentYep, and to make things worse, even if your account is empty, if you had a (unpublished) paid app, you still have to go through the account verification stuff and provide your drivers license, etc to Google.

The thing that makes this particular case feel weird to me is that the organization playing gatekeeper is also competing directly with this app. reply quitit 4 hours agorootparentSeems like the solution is to make that approval process independent. (As for who would pay for that, who can say, should it be government run?, should it have application fees? etc) While I sympathise with developers who are the victim of mistakes, we have no transparency to know who is actually in the wrong. There is also constant subjective criticism about what is too little or too much protective oversight. Fortnite was approved by both Apple and Google despite the FTC fining Epic for intentionally tricking children into making unwanted purchases, (Epic would also kill the account if the parent did charge backs), other scam apps have snuck onto the various stores over the years, and it wasn't too long ago that both Facebook and Google used side-loading to distribute data collection apps that wouldn't pass official channels. reply Zambyte 4 hours agorootparent> As for who would pay for that, who can say, should it be government run? Distribute the cost by distributing sources. The GNU/Linux ecosystem has been operating just fine on this model for decades. reply thrance 7 hours agoparentprevIdeally, installing apps from third parties should be as easy as from the google play store. Today, when I install an APK I get a 10 seconds unskippable warning screen about \"potential dangers\", and after installing, another unskippable 1 minute \"security check\" screen. All of this bullshit is 100% done to deter most people from going through, by scaring them or making it a chore. Also, apps installed through APKs do not update automatically, you have to fetch the updated APK file for every updates and go through this painful process again.

Incompetence? Perhaps. Also, every store makes mistakes from time to time. On top of this, the Play Store is just one of the few stores you can have on Android. Organic Maps itself can be installed via F-Droid, Huawei's store, Aptoide, etc, not to mention that you can download the apk from their site/Github and install it.

    "originBody": "RETAIL·ELON MUSK X ordered to pay €550,000 to Irish employee fired for not replying to Elon Musk’s yes-or-resign ‘extremely hardcore’ ultimatum BYOLIVIA FLETCHER AND BLOOMBERG Elon Musk, CEO of X (formerly known as Twitter). STRINGER/ANADOLU/GETTY IMAGES Elon Musk’s X has been ordered to pay compensation to a former staff member of its Irish unit in an unfair dismissal case. The social network platform formerly known as Twitter was ordered to pay out over €550,000 ($602,640) to the former employee, Ireland’s Workplace Relations Commission, the state body responsible for adjudicating employment disputes, said on Tuesday. It is the largest sum the agency has ever awarded, according to Irish broadcaster RTE. Gary Rooney, who held a senior procurement role at the time of his dismissal in December 2022, had been employed by the company since September 2013. The Commission heard that the social media platform maintained that the employee had resigned voluntarily after he failed to tick a box committing to new unspecified working arrangements in an email from the company’s new owner Musk. Rooney was one of thousands of Twitter employees sent an email by Musk requiring them to pledge to stay with the company, working long hours at “high intensity” during its transformation, or to accept a buyout. Staff were given a day to click “yes” to agree to unspecified employment terms. The commission rejected X’s argument that Rooney quit voluntarily and ruled that not clicking “yes” in response to the email did not constitute an act of resignation. “It is not OK for Mr. Musk, or indeed any large company to treat employees in such a manner in this country or jurisdiction. The record award reflects the seriousness and the gravity of the case,” the complainant’s solicitor Barry Kenny told Bloomberg. It’s one in a string of cases that have sprung up since Musk purchased the platform. Multiple lawsuits have already alleged that Twitter employees didn’t receive their promised severance benefits, while the site has come under more intense scrutiny since he acquired it. The dispute arose in Dublin after billionaire Musk took ownership of the platform in late 2022. The Irish capital had about 500 employees before the takeover, but has since been impacted by the global staff exodus from the firm. The WRC in its 73-page ruling stated the emails had been sent “at a time of rapid change in Twitter and in the context of inconsistent, contradictory and confusing communications from the Respondent in connection with the takeover of the Company by Mr. Musk.” X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The company can lodge an appeal to the Labour Court within 42 days. Recommended Newsletter: The Fortune Next to Lead newsletter is a must-read for the next generation of C-suite leaders.

They can fire everyone wearing red shirts, if they wanted to. There are also very few places providing leave (outside of white-collar positions). For example, my wife was given two weeks off from her job after having my son. The state we lived in only required maternity leave to be implemented at companies having more than 50 employees. Oh, and those two weeks were unpaid. In some places, taking a vacation longer than three weeks requires the company to stop paying your salary and consider you \"abandoning\" your job, or submitting special paperwork. I do not miss the US; moving to the EU was the best decision I ever made. reply Fokamul 9 hours agorootparent\"Unpaid two weeks of matternity leave\" are you nuts? Holy sh.. \"vacation longer than three weeks requires the company to stop paying your salary\" What? Why is it called vacation then, I cannot comprehend this at all, heh. Don't tell them some EU companies even give unlimited PAID vacation, lol. Never experienced this myself, because I usually have \"only\" 5 weeks paids vacation, but unlimited HO. Of course in practice this means I have main job and also doing self-employed contracts, if work in my main job is done. reply WrongAssumption 4 hours agorootparentUnlimited vacation was actually pioneered in the U.S., and spread from there.

In fact, by not providing a fixed amount, and calling it unlimited, it lets managers put peer pressure onto people into taking less vacations than if they'd made a fixed amount! reply marpstar 3 hours agorootparentTo add to that: it also can't be \"banked\" (and thereby paid out after departure). Companies give free PTO because real \"paid time off\" has to be tracked as a liability on their books; if you haven't \"earned\" anything and they don't \"credit\" you, you aren't \"owed\" you anything when you leave/are terminated. reply 1over137 1 hour agorootparentWhat does PTO mean here? reply wisemang 1 hour agorootparentPersonal time off (or maybe sometimes paid time off) reply kcarter80 3 hours agorootparentprevIt is unlimited if the employee is talented and good at advocating for themselves.

If you don't suck, they'll respect you more, not less. reply zarzavat 2 hours agorootparentprevIt should be called unknown vacation. There’s a limit, you just don’t know where it is. I assume if you took the UK legal minimum of 5.6 weeks for example, you would get fired. reply barbazoo 2 hours agorootparentprevI’ve experienced unlimited PTO myself and have yet to see any kind of pressure.

If you go over three weeks, they still require special paperwork, but they allow it if you are tenured enough. What unlimited means is \"as long as your manager is decent, you will maybe get your days off\" vs accrued vacation where you may be forced to take vacation to not lose it. reply jonhohle 4 hours agorootparentMy last office job had unlimited vacation and I never used it (not did most of my coworkers) and at the end of the year you neither had the days taken off nor had you accrued any credit for I taken time. At the job before that I had accrued 6 weeks of PTO, which was the max. I took every other Friday off after that and was paid out a month and a half when I left the company. Everyone understood the situation, so it wasn’t looked down upon when I was gone every other week. My perspective was that unlimited PTO was a scam to reduce vacation time. Most people are not going to take advantage of it, so the company benefits. reply dunham 3 hours agorootparentIn addition to not having to pay out at the end of employment, they also do the \"unlimited vacation\" thing to reduce the liability of unpaid PTO on the books. When our revenue was hit hard in the early days of covid, the company I work for asked everyone to take a week of their PTO to help the financials look better. reply withinboredom 9 hours agorootparentprev> accrued vacation where you may be forced to take vacation to not lose it. I don't look at it that way. If you have accrued vacation, you \"earned\" your vacation and they can't take it away from you without compensation. Thus, you are guaranteed your days off. If they fire you, they should even have to pay you your salary for those vacation days. \"Unlimited\" vacation just gives all the control to your employer: the right to deny you vacation, the right to dictate how long your vacation is, etc. reply lmkg 6 hours agorootparent> If you have accrued vacation, you \"earned\" your vacation and they can't take it away from you without compensation... If they fire you, they should even have to pay you your salary for those vacation days. This is the law in California but not most other states. In most states, vacation time is a benefit that can expire, evaporate, or be rescinded. The company is just deciding not to assign you job duties during your time off. How generous of them! But it's totally their right to decide not to do that, or to put a bunch of boxes around how they will do that. So it's legal, and common, that unused vacation time will actually be lost. In CA, accrued vacation time is classified as \"deferred compensation.\" It is legally money that is owed to you. It will be paid at a later date, but it must be paid. It strikes me as no coincidence that the \"unlimited vacation\" fad started in tech companies with a large chunk of their workforce in California. reply mark-r 4 hours agorootparentNebraska goes a step further. Lots of companies have a \"use it or lose it\" policy for vacation time, so they won't have a ton of liability on the books. Nebraska courts have declared that vacation time is compensation that can't be taken away from you, so \"lose it\" isn't an option. I worked for a company with half its workforce in Nebraska even though I'm in Minnesota. To comply with the law, the company didn't pay out your vacation at the end of the year - they locked you out and forced you to take it, now. reply leetrout 5 hours agorootparentprevBingo: unlimited vacation is a scam reply ghaff 5 hours agorootparentIt's highly dependent on company (and team) culture. If you can actually take a generous amount of vacation, personal, and sick (if you need it) time, I have no real problem with it. (Then, I haven't moved around a lot--I know some people who move jobs every year or two count on a payout from accrued vacation when they do.) Someone I know who retired from a fairly senior position at Netflix rather liked it and took some fairly long vacations but said there really was a good tradition of umplugging at least as he observed that came from the top. reply leetrout 1 hour agorootparentMinimum / mandatory PTO is the answer. https://namely.com/blog/minimum-pto-what-is-it-why-you-shoul... reply VincentEvans 5 hours agorootparentprevIt really depends. The company I work for - doesn’t even have a time-keeping system. Taking vacation is a matter of sending a slack or email, or simply verbally letting your manager and team mates know that you won’t be available. So far this year I’ve taken more than 3 weeks at least. I know it’s not a ton, but the point is - that I don’t know the actual exact count, I strongly suspect that nobody really tracks it in any way, and I am planning to take few weeks more before the next year. reply leetrout 1 hour agorootparentI replied to the sibling comment, minimum vacation policies are more employee friendly and can offer the same flexibility as \"unlimited\". reply solatic 8 hours agorootparentprev> If you have accrued vacation, you \"earned\" your vacation and they can't take it away from you without compensation... If they fire you, they should even have to pay you your salary for those vacation days. This is indeed the law in Israel. What happens is that people are allowed to accrue a number of vacation days up to a limit, typically however many days of vacation you earn in a year, times two. Then the company forces you to take, at the end of the year, a number of vacation days down to the limit. Companies where this limit wasn't put in place introduced a moral hazard, whereby people would wink-and-handshake with their superiors when they would take a reasonable amount of vacation without actually reporting the vacation days to HR, wherein HR didn't really have the means to detect and enforce against the fraud. Thus people would work for decades, retire, and take compensation for decades of \"untaken\" vacation days, on top of the normal retirement packages. These policies represented usually $1+ million in obligation per worker and thus were clearly unsustainable without some kind of enforceable limit. reply gpvos 5 hours agorootparentWhy would a company allow that, can't they put a limit on that themselves?

But change at the federal level is a substantially harder thing to bring. reply ryandrake 4 hours agorootparentExactly. It's not a matter of accepting or not accepting. There's practically nothing that can be done about it. At the federal level, no major presidential candidate supports EU-style worker protections and mandatory benefits. And not enough congressional candidates support it, not even remotely enough to change anything. In fact, the vast majority are outright hostile to worker rights due to lobbying/capture by corporate interests. At the state level, there is lots of variance, but even in the states most friendly to workers, it's not remotely possible to reach Europe's level of benefits around vacation, sick leave, maternity leave, let alone the right to organize for these things. There is no political will, and any political candidate who actually has the will could never win a statewide election. reply YZF 4 hours agorootparentprevThe way this worked in many places is that workers formed political parties. In France people did and still take to the streets over labour issues. You can also unionize. Or sure, lobby. But if people are happy with the current system then that's also fine. All in all the US has been a success story. Whether there's correlation or causation between that and some of the regulatory and legal environment is hard to say.

If you're not working, you're not getting paid. Anything additional is a bonus at the discretion of the employer. reply fhd2 9 hours agorootparentThat's where I suppose the US and EU truly differ. The US generally goes for the \"the market will solve it\" approach. If you're a bad employer, nobody wants to work there, the company goes down and the competition wins. It's a beautiful theory IMHO. The EU approach is sort of the same, but to add regulation on top to steer the market towards specific goals, like having a strong middle class. If, for example, a company doesn't suffer from being nasty to their employees (e.g. because they're a monopolist), regulation will be put in place to create that dynamic. I personally find this approach more feasible, but regulation can be worked around and sometimes backfire, it's not easy to get right. Back to your point: It comes down to how much you get paid. If you work full time and can't afford vacation or sickness, is that OK? If you think that's OK, we just disagree I suppose. There's a power imbalance between employers and employees that favours the employers. They have more money, expertise, legal counsel, negotiation power etc. Given the chance, they will pay as little as they can for labour, crush competition etc. I don't believe that's good for a country in the long run. If you think it's not OK, something has to happen. Paying people more so they can save up money to deal with this is one approach. Assuming the risk of them not working (with paid vacation and sick days) is another one. In the EU, we tend to go down the latter route. I guess you could see it as patronising, but there is beauty in sharing and distributing personal risks. I'm personally fine with both solutions. I'm running a consultancy right now, so I've decided to take the first route, assume and manage my own risks. reply playingalong 4 hours agorootparentI am not sure all these rules are for stronger middle class. I have always thought these are for low-paid workers at a warehouse, cleaning the streets, or alike. They are way more replaceable than some specialist. Yet the state offers protection for their time off which they deserve. reply fhd2 15 minutes agorootparentYeah, maybe that was a bad example, I just meant that the government has certain goals for society and uses regulation to steer the market towards meeting them. Historically, that stuff was put in place for factory workers in the industrial revolution I presume, though I'm very fuzzy on that. I'd argue good living conditions for low level workers help create a strong middle class through upward social mobility, but that's going off on a tangent perhaps. reply luckylion 2 hours agorootparentprevA company having a monopoly on the labor market wouldn't be called a company, that's a collectivist state.

If there's only one bakery corporation in your country and you're a baker, you can either work there, learn a new job or leave the country. It's a bit orthogonal for sure, but competition for talent is vital for good conditions for workers.

Suddenly their need for competent staff is greatly reduced. > But that's quite literally what insurance is made for. The only difference is that insurance adds some amount of accountability In my book, insurance is for unlikely, expensive events. In Germany for example, if an employee is sick for more than six weeks, the company no longer pays their salary, the health insurance takes over. It's likely that an employee is sick for a couple of days, not a case for insurance. Just how it's likely that an employee will want some vacation, also not a case for insurance. I could however picture a system where companies only pay for the work employees actually do, and the funding for paid time off and sick days comes from some other source. Sounds intriguing. I believe everybody should be able to take some time off work for leisure and sickness, I see that as a human right. How exactly that's achieved, I'm personally very flexible there. reply addicted 2 hours agorootparentprev> In the US, in most (all?) jurisdictions, your employer doesn't really need to have a reason to fire you. They can fire everyone wearing red shirts, if they wanted to. This is not entirely correct. They can fire you for any reason as long as it’s not because of a protected reason. There are certain protected reasons at the federal level and many states add additional ones at the state level. So, for example, they can fire you for wearing a red shirt, but they cannot fire you for being too old (well, too old is defined as above 40…if you’re 35 they can legally fire you for being too old if they want). reply pfannkuchen 5 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if the development of maternity leave sort of happened backwards from how we typically think of it happening. Like most people talk about it as if culturally we used to expect 0 accommodations for working mothers, which was bad, and the expectation has increased over time. But, actually in the past the mother would have spent many dedicated years with the infant/baby/toddler/child, until they entered school. If the mother has multiple children, it’s not really practical for a company to hold their spot open for like 8 years and I don’t think this happens even in the most progressive of European countries. So, culturally speaking, does the rise of maternity leave actually come from an increasing cultural tolerance for the mother spending less time with the child via daycare? reply realityking 4 hours agorootparent> If the mother has multiple children, it’s not really practical for a company to hold their spot open for like 8 years and I don’t think this happens even in the most progressive of European countries. Almost no one in Europe has 8 children but I know women who went on maternity leave 3 times. Generally kills your career as you don‘t advance during those years (and most only work part time afterwards) but the original job is still there. Especially in very large companies, it‘s not too big of a burden. Just some extra slack in headcount planning. It‘s pretty rough in smaller companies. I used to sit on the board of pre-school. 5-6 employees, all women, lots of pregnancies and with the added twist that if they didn‘t have certain childhood diseases or vaccinations, they weren‘t allowed to work the entire pregnancy. We had to hire a lot of folks on temporary contracts. Worth pointing out, while we had to pay the salary in case of work not being permitted and the time no work is allowed for anyone pregnant (6 weeks before birth and 8 weeks after), this is fully reimbursed trough insurance schemes every company has to pay into. reply pfannkuchen 3 hours agorootparent> Almost no one in Europe has 8 children You don’t need 8 children to get to 8 years of dedicated child care with the pre-daycare-normalization worldview. You only need 2 children with an offset of 3 years, or 3 children with less offset. reply realityking 3 hours agorootparentFair point, I‘ve been considering todays standard of one year off for each child. That said, at least in Germany, you can‘t get to 8 years with 2 children as the maximum time for parental leave is capped at 36 months per child. reply xtiansimon 5 hours agorootparentprev> “…vacation longer than three weeks requires the company to stop paying your salary and consider you \"abandoning\" your job” Can you explain more about your experience with this? I’ve never heard of it. You begin by referring to at-will employment, which has a long history in state laws. This context gives the impression the “what” that is doing the “requiring” is the state and its laws. I’m wondering if this “long vacation” thing has a basis in law or possibly originates from individual company or union contracts.

In my personal case, I could save a bit more (very roughly 20%?) in the US, but I've concluded that it wasn't worth it.

If I were to lose my FAANG job, there would be no way I'd make the same amount of money in a different company in my country.

An employee has needs that sometimes cannot go untended, s/he has rent/mortgage payments, s/he may have family to take care of, loan repayments, children at non-free school, etc etc. This is normal, and the paraphernalia of living a life. They are long-term commitments. So if the employee is presented with an ultimatum like this, it really amounts to “rip up your life, or take the new (worse) offer we are giving you”. It smacks of Vader’s famous line: “I am altering the deal. Pray that I don’t alter it any further”.

When an employee is acknowledged as being hired \"at will\", courts deny the employee any claim for loss resulting from the dismissal. reply burnished 9 hours agoparentprevNot a lawyer but broadly most forms of employment in the US is considered to be 'at will' and can be terminated by either party at any time for most any reason (excluding membership of a protected class). If you were fired for failing to respond to the yes-or-resign I believe you would be able to claim unemployment because they can't force you to resign and changing the terms of employment to force a resignation is a 'constructive dismissal'. American employers tend to be big fans of lying and hoping you don't know your rights though, or denying valid unemployment claims because they know not everyone will contest it. Some people do have employment contracts with more consideration but as I understand it that mostly applies to union work and C suite executive positions. reply andyferris 9 hours agorootparentWhat does \"claim unemployment\" mean in this context? reply sethammons 9 hours agorootparentTo claim unemployment is to take advantage of Unemployment Insurance. Companies pay into that and when you are terminated (doesn't count if fired for cause) you get some predefined amount of money for a period of time to help while job searching. The amount is dramatically less than your normal pay. reply hyperliner 9 hours agorootparentprevUnemployment insurance is a form of insurance in US that pays you if you lose your job due to layoffs and other conditions. It is paid by you so it is not “welfare.” It is managed by each state independently and has some rules. For example, if you lose you job today and “don’t claim” unemployment insurance for two weeks, those two weeks are not paid out to you (this is in Texas). Every week, you must show that you are “actively” looking for a job. You may lose the benefit if you are not, or if a job is available but you decide not to take it. You must report on your efforts to find a job (interviews etc), and must attend some state class about looking for work. Most states’ unemployment insurance covers up to a maximum benefit per week, and a maximum number of weeks. When I lost my job once, I was paid $325 per week. reply projektfu 3 hours agorootparentAt least in my state, the employee does not pay unemployment insurance tax, but the amount the employer pays is usually reported on the paystub. That is, if you are paid $85,000 salary it won't be reduced by the unemployment tax. However, some economists treat all payroll taxes as effectively paid by the employee out of \"total compensation\". reply InsideOutSanta 9 hours agoparentprevI think this is probably legal in the US, since most employment is \"at-will,\" meaning both parties can terminate it at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all (with some specific exceptions that probably wouldn't apply in this case). Your employment contract may have terms that override the at-will relationship, in which case the employer has to follow the contract's terms. You may also be unionized, in which case the union will have negotiated termination procedures with your employer. And you may live in a State that has additional rules for terminating contracts. But as a general rule, I believe this is legal in the US in most cases. reply hippich 9 hours agoparentprevFrom everything I read, in US, in general, outside of specific list of protected reasons, or a contract specifically describing conditions for contact termination, one can be fired at any time.

However, there are no real consequences if I would just leave without notice. Other than my employer having a bad opinion of me afterward of course.

If I already had a new job that I would like to start immediately, I could just do that. reply tpm 4 hours agorootparentprevYes this is by law but if the employer is willing it's always possible to agree to immediate termination. The law is there to protect both sides in case of disagreements only, does not limit otherwise. reply hansvm 2 hours agoparentprevIn (parts of -- often state-defined laws) the US it might or might not. - Generally, you can be fired without any particular reason. - Outside of a few whitelisted reasons (like being fired \"for cause\"), when fired, you can collect unemployment (a system where the employer self-insures, sending money into a governmental pool to payout in such cases) for O(1 yr), with caps in the $900/mo.range, depending on the state. Not clicking on the link would likely not count as \"cause,\" but Twitter might try to argue it does (not that it necessarily matters since the severance package is probably better and probably precludes filing for unemployment). - Other labor laws exist, like requiring some sort of notification period for mass layoffs. If this were found to be a mass layoff in disguise, there'd be additional penalties. - Similarly with race or any of the things you can't fire a person for (e.g., if a person didn't see the email because they were pregnant and doing something medically relevant, a lawyer might be able to say something about the firing being structured in a way that discriminates against pregnant people, which is not legal). - If the link had any attached terms and conditions, those likely would not be enforceable since the contract was agreed to under duress. - Any other contracts between Twitter and the employees might matter. Perhaps the firing is allowed, but there are other constraints on the exact manner (e.g., having previously negotiated a better severance package). - If the link had any specific terms involving lower pay or reduced benefits or whatnot, there's a decent chance that it was criminal extortion or blackmail in various parts of the US. And so on. We can start tacking on hypotheticals which might apply, but I'll stop there. > indentured servitude There's no need to be so hyperbolic when bagging on the US. It's bad that we don't have great safety nets for people, but forcing individual employers to take up the slack isn't an ideal solution either (still no protections when the employer goes bankrupt or when a crisis hits somebody like a college student, and it disproportionately impacts the smallest businesses because you can't spread the risk out across a lot of employees and revenue -- an imperfect but almost strictly better solution is just raising the unemployment rates to match the real inflation we've seen), and it's nothing like indentured servitude which allows the working conditions to degrade nearly arbitrarily without a chance to leave and go someplace better. reply jordanb 5 hours agoparentprevIn a lot of US jurisdictions there are rules that you have 21 days to review a severance agreement.

Delta tried not paying around £3000 owed to a customer.

This corporate mentalities of \"We'll do anything except pay what we owe.\" and \"We should always be able to throw more lawyers at a problem to delay it.\" Not to mention having the manager pay the police out of her own pocket. Doesn't Delta have a petty cash policy giving discretion to managers around payments of small amounts like this? The whole thing was both bonkers and very entertaining! reply proteal 2 hours agorootparentThis is one of those “left hand doesn’t talk to the right” situations. Delta has an arm of the company that only deals in disputes and has another arm that does check in and routine services. I think the manager did a good job here - I highly doubt there is a listed provision for allowances like this, but she paid anyways because she understood what the right thing to do was after confirming everything was legit. Unfortunately, companies have to play so defensively because they hold so much power, otherwise people will take advantage and bleed them dry. Note that this isn’t a political comment, I’m not interested in what should be, rather what is. If a company makes an honest mistake, courts will typically side with the less powerful party when possible. For example, JCPenney did a promotion with Firestone back in the day where you could get your car battery replaced for life. The intent of the promo was life of the car, ie 8-12 years, but the language really said “basically forever.” There are people to this day, decades later, still getting free battery replacements[1]. Hell, there are people who even hunt for the batteries and make good money when they find them in scrapyards. This promo turned into a perpetuity JCP did not want or intend to have on its books. That mistake went all the way to the top of the company and caused real change in how they did cross promos. I’m willing to bet this delta fiasco went to the CEO’s desk and the company addressed it, one way or another.

I hope other employees and EU countries follow suit and slap X with more fines, if this impacted other citizens as well. reply fhd2 9 hours agorootparentThe problem is that you can still get fooled or bullied into accepting a bad deal. I suggest everyone working in the EU to learn their rights and to consult a lawyer when something doesn't feel right, doesn't cost much here, initial consultations are often even free. Don't sign something put in front of you before you had a chance to understand your position. The person who wants you to sign it had ample time to do that, you didn't. Same goes for accepting things that seem unfair via email or verbally, that can weaken your position already. I've been on both sides of the fence (mostly in Germany). As an employer, my approach was usually to be nice to employees I wanted to get rid of and to offer them a good severance package proactively. If you push an employee and give them ammunition to sue (and you fail to fool/bully them) it's gonna get a lot more expensive. Not to mention distracting/emotional. Just keep in mind that if you hire an FTE, you'll have to mentally put money aside to exit them at some point in the future. Hiring freelancers is more expensive, but doesn't carry these problems. I tend to mix FTEs and freelancers, partly to distribute the risks and costs. When talking to people in bad situations with their employer, I'm always surprised how little they know and how easily they're willing to take the short end of the stick. There's a deal between you and the company that specifies what you'll do for them and what you'll get in return, with legal context surrounding it. I think it's also good to be nice and willing to compromise in that situation, but employees generally don't seem to be aware of what a powerful position they're actually in, and don't feel they \"deserve\" that, or don't want to upset anyone. It's business at the end of the day, contracts. Don't be a bad business person, it's not like CEOs will respect or like you more if you don't put up a fight. Typically the opposite. The lack of these protections is one thing that, IMHO, warrants the comparatively high US salaries in tech. More risk, more reward - business 101 stuff. reply nolok 8 hours agorootparentNot sure about germany or other countries but in France any contractual change that specifically make the employee position worse without any clear return is essentially voided in \"prud'hommes\" (the workers/companies justice court) unless they were warned in advance of a negociation meet and brought their representative with them (any company above 10 must have one, and more and more as the company grow). Also, any major change need to be in counter signed writing, it cannot be a one way thing, not even a \"we both agreed\" even if it's true. As an employer myself it sometimes lead to seemingly absurd situation where you need heavy procedures for a simple change, but the end result is that no worker is screwed this way in a way that would stick in court (it still does happen, mostly in areas where people don't go to court after, of course). A specific kind of deal is the \"the company is going south, we make a collective agreement like eg no firing and no dividends and workers agreed to reduced hours or salary for X months\" things like this, and in Twitter case it could be what they should have used, but again these have clear procedures and steps to be considered legal and not abuse by the employer, and as you can imagine a middle of the night email with no representation does not fit at all. I know Musk is a know it all that believe he is so smart and better that he doesn't need to listen to the competent persons around, but I wished I could be a fly on the wall in the company's lawyer room that day, just for the absurdity of it (I imagine it was sort of \"we can pretend it's ok, or we can tell him and be fired too\"). reply fhd2 8 hours agorootparentOh we don't appear to have that level of protections in Germany. If you accept, for example, a demotion (that one could argue is still in line with the job title and description in your contract) via email, it's difficult to contest later. If you do want to contest it, you have to be quick and do it in writing. For something like reducing salary or other benefits, or changing your job title, those need to be counter signed. Problem is, quite often promotions are (deliberately) not offered with contract amendments, so when you're demoted later, the company can argue you've never legally been promoted in the first place. Sounds like a drag, but it's incredibly useful to describe your role and responsibilities in the employment contract, and to insist on an update once promoted. As for Musk's lawyers, I'd also love to know how exactly that played out, I can imagine all kinds of scenarios, some hilarious. The most likely to me seems that he wasn't exactly involved in this particular case, or any of these cases. People handle it based on what they think he'd want to do, then pass on the bad news if their plots fail somehow. I'm assuming this might be net positive for him in the end: He got away with the forced, incredibly quick culture change and workforce culling and was able to move forward with his strategy immediately.

The value of HN is hearing differing view points. It would be nice if people on HN tried to engage in a good willed nature rather than treating discussions like a struggle session. But to the topic at hand, in rapidly changing sectors, high levels of friction when it comes to employment has a cost. There is no free lunch in economics. When hiring employees means you’re hiring them effectively for life, it creates disincentives for hiring. Maybe you hiring consultants instead. Or maybe you make do and not hire at all. No doubt it benefits employees when it comes to job stability. But the cost can be not having those jobs at all. That’s something that has to be considered in the equation. The other thing is the employee obligations it creates. When I worked in Europe I had to give three months notice to quit. Either that or pay the company the equivalent of the salary I made. As an employee it was a penalty I couldn’t afford and thus opportunities at start ups that needed someone now were out of reach. Employee protections had a real cost to me.

Wirecard was a disaster for a multitude of reasons: The company itself [lost|stole|defrauded] a billion euros, their auditors (Ernst&Young, now \"EY\") failed to notice a billion euros of irregularities and lost their auditing license over the debacle. The german banking authorities failed in some capacity I cannot remember right now. reply com 6 hours agorootparentThe BaFin regulatory failure was pretty spectacular too, despite the lid that the German establishment tried to put on it. Not so much has leaked out so far, mainly because prosecutors have declined to take much action against the regulator or its employees and officers, however what is known is pretty damning. First, they ignored early - like TEN YEARS - and relatively continuous warnings about fraud at Wirecard. Then they legally targeted journalists who pointed out misconduct at Wirecard (!!!) Then they banned short-sellers from shorting Wirecard (!!!!!!) and indeed in internal memos mentioned that short-sellers were Israelis and British citizens in some kind of bigoted justification for the ban. Gross and disgusting, but perhaps par for the course in some levels of the government there. They tried to cover up malfeasance within their own org, including at least one, but probably more employees undertaking insider trades on Wirecard before its failure. But don’t be too worried about the poor chauffeur-driven bureaucrats at BaFin! They’ve since reorganised and added more senior employees to an already bloated and ineffectual regulator who are culturally in bed with the regulated entities. The gravy train must continue. (Just reviewing what happened through internet searches has caused steam to come out of my ears again. What the actual fuck was BaFin doing all those years?) reply imtringued 7 hours agorootparentprevI don't know why you are interested in a niche BaaS/Investment bank. The customer facing \"fintech\" is N26 and they used Wirecard as a BaaS(banking as a service) provider before they had their own banking license. If you are interested in another BaaS then checkout SolarisBank instead. We also have our own fancy pants multi billion dollar delivery companies like \"Delivery Hero/Lieferheld\" or Zalando that Silicon Valley types are so fond of. SoundCloud is a German startup. So is ResearchGate. Or how about Hello fresh that so many English speaking YouTubers tend to have sponsorships with? By the way I was mostly trying to think of Silicon Valley esque startups with a strong internet presence. The moment you talk about things like semiconductors, digital twins, robotics, basically any manufacturing related technology, Germany has a long list of major \"tech\" companies. I know, I know \"tech\" is actually American slang for software, not hardware, technology but still. reply snowpid 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah, Such rage bait argument with no real arguments don't help to improve my perception. reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentCare to reply with opposing facts?

It doesn’t generally get included for the same reason IBM doesn’t typically get included in list of ‘tech companies’, even if they are one of the oldest actual tech companies. Been around forever (70’s or earlier), large multinational, more about business integration and sales than any headline tech. Frankly, their tech has been a side thought for a very long time internally. It’s a blue chip that happens to involve tech, not a ‘tech company’ like any of the FAANGs. Same issue Tata/Wipro, etc. have IMO. Arguably Oracle falls in the same class too. A parallel comment mentioned Deutsch Telecom, but they’re really not a ‘tech company’ anymore than T-Mobile, AT&T, Comcast, etc. are. If we include it anyway, that gives Germany 2 and the US…. Several dozen? Minimum? Maybe 50ish, actually. Even if we don’t use the same broad criteria in the US. If we use the same broad criteria in the US, probably 1/3 of the Fortune 500 qualify, if not more. Is Bank of America a ‘tech company’? reply tovej 8 hours agorootparentprevThat is unbelievable to me. You always have the right to quit, and penalties are rare. The laws depend on the country you're in of course, but I've never heard of three months, and I've lived in Europe my whole life. Would you mind sharing the country you were working in? reply pathsjs 4 hours agorootparentI am Italian and at my previous work at a bank, I had a two month notice (originally one, but increased with seniority). As far as I know, it is pretty common in Italy, and employers know that when they hire someone, the person will only join one to three months later due to this - or sometimes they offer to pay the penalty reply seritools 5 hours agorootparentprevIn Germany the minimum time of notice for being fired scales up with your seniority (number of years employed in the company). However, many work contracts add a stipulation that the minimum time of notice from the law be applied to both parties equally, so quitting will also need an advance notice of the same length. reply vidarh 7 hours agorootparentprevIn Norway, 3 months notice is the norm, and you can be expected to work it. In practice, there's rarely much value in holding people to it (though it can happen) because someone who really doesn't want to be there isn't going to be a productive employee. But lots of people do stay the 3 months because people looking to hire are also used to often having to wait 3 months to get someone on full time. reply ubersnack 5 hours agorootparentprevIn England I had a 3 month notice period at a previous employer, luckily the employer I was going to was okay with waiting that amount of time. reply jokethrowaway 7 hours agorootparentprevIt's pretty common to have penalties if you quit without notice. It's also a breach of contract. Employers probably won't go after you in court though, unless your immediate departure cause them some damage larger than the lawyer's bill. One month is common for juniors or contractors. I've never seen a contract with less than 1 month notice in tech. Three months is common for senior or management positions. reply Aeolun 7 hours agorootparentI’ve only ever seen one month in both Europe and Japan. With no stipulated penalties for leaving immediately (beyond, you know, being an a*). reply jokethrowaway 7 hours agorootparentprevWell, stifling regulation is one problem, but the real reason the EU is behind is the lack of a single place with low taxes on investors and talent. The effect is compounded by all the smart talent going to SV or large rich cities (London, Zurich), leaving scraps to the rest. Unrealized capital tax gains being reinvested tax free made Silicon Valley's exponential growth possible (which is the only reason why a16z was forced to back Trump despite the Tech are being overwhelmingly democrat leaning - they're scared they'll be taxed out of existance). reply Yeul 8 hours agorootparentprevUnemployment is low, rapidly aging society. Any company that treats it's people this way will find their workers looking for greener pastures. reply mytailorisrich 7 hours agorootparentprevThe issue in Europe is that in many countries the law goes to the opposite extreme. The level of 'protection' and rigidity is so high that it actually utimately hurts people because there are fewer opportunities and lower growth as a result. reply perlgeek 8 hours agoparentprevBTW in Germany, if a company decides to lay off people just to save money, they have to coordinate with some government agency -- and if the company doesn't have financial trouble, those layoffs can be blocked. This happened to Alphabet/Google when they wanted to lay off 6% of their workforce, but were wildly profitable. They couldn't in Germany. (This probably wouldn't have applied in the Twitter case, because Twitter wasn't profitable, but it illustrates that there are processes and rules around employment that might seem very unusual to others). reply pembrook 6 hours agorootparentI know the subtext of this comment is \"European labor laws are good.\" But it seems you've cited an example of something ironically very anti-labor. This means your government has codified into law the false idea that all human employees are undifferentiated commodities (like cattle). So as an employer, if there's no ability to remove underperformers every year, you've turned employment into a market for lemons, and created a classic adverse selection problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons A market for lemons 1) suppresses prices [wages in this context] 2) decreases price variance and 3) creates inefficiencies. As 50% of workers are actually above average (statistics!), you've created a negative feedback loop hurting workers wages and ultimately growth in the economy. reply VonGallifrey 5 hours agorootparent> But it seems you've cited an example of something ironically very anti-labor. This means your government has codified into law the false idea that all human employees are undifferentiated commodities (like cattle). So as an employer, if there's no ability to remove underperformers every year No, that is not the case. You can still fire people and you can do so especially if they are underperforming. You just can't do it as a mass layoff. If you fire someone then you need a reason to do so. If you fire people because of a layoff then you need to show that the layoff is legitimate. You can not just group underperformers and let them go as a layoff because you are circumventing labor law. You can not lie about the reason why you are letting someone go. No one would care if you fired 99% of your company IF you are prepared to show they were underperforming and that was the official reason given. reply sebazzz 2 hours agorootparentprev> So as an employer, if there's no ability to remove underperformers every year, you've turned employment into a market for lemons You can fire someone, but not on a whim*.

I would be very interested in the government agency you are alluding to. There are laws regulating layoffs due to operating conditions (Kuendigungsschutzgesetz). But these laws do not allow the government to intervene directly in company affairs - that would be communism! If a company wants to restructure \"for internal reasons\" (rationalizations are specifically mentioned) it is allowed to do so. This includes offshoring, moving workload to contractors, or simply getting rid of a department. However: many of the large companies (eg. SAP, BASF, carmakers,...) have collective labor agreements. These agreements often exclude layoffs due to operational conditions within a certain period. Under very special circumstances layoffs are still possible in such arrangements, but the companies have to prove their economic hardship and the layoffs often end with a sort of golden handshake. If they happen at all :) reply paulddraper 5 hours agorootparentprevThis is a great way to cement inefficiencies and create pencil pushers. reply rapsey 4 hours agorootparentGermany in a nutshell. reply throw310822 8 hours agorootparentprevnext [4 more] [flagged] sensanaty 5 hours agorootparentIf \"innovation\" equals firing a quarter of your company at a moment's notice because some psychotic C-level wants 3 cents more of profit this quarter, then I'll take stagnation, thanks. reply GJim 7 hours agorootparentprev[citation needed] Frankly, your comment is ignorant trolling and has no place here. reply throw310822 6 hours agorootparentFrankly, I am European and I know what I'm talking about. It seems obvious that there is a conflict between protecting workers' rights and giving companies the freedom to decide what's best for them. On the other hand there is a dearth of dynamic and successful startups in Europe and it's hard to imagine that workers protection have nothing to do with it- also because in my own country I have seen countless times excessive workers protections slowly suffocate a company, until both the jobs and the entire business are lost. reply surgical_fire 9 hours agoparentprevIt's the main reason I chose to move to Europe instead of the US, despite potentially making more money in the US. I very much appreciate the labor protections in most EU countries. reply londons_explore 9 hours agorootparentYou are effectively buying those labour protections with the difference in salary. Companies could even offer that as an option. We pay you $97k with no labour protections, or $68k but we promise to give you all the labour rights that Germany has, including nice long holidays, unions, no unpaid overtime, can't be fired without cause, etc. Your choice. (And those figures are the median programmer salary in the USA and Germany respectively) reply surgical_fire 9 hours agorootparent> You are effectively buying those labour protections with the difference in salary. Yes. And I appreciate those labor protections enough that I gladly pay for them. I could still buy a car, a house, raise a family, have some savings, etc. The stability and security provided by the labor protections are very much appreciated, a lot more than some extra cash would be. reply nudgeee 9 hours agorootparentThat, and the peace of mind of not being fired at-will when economic times aren’t so good. reply ekianjo 9 hours agorootparentthis also means companies are much more hesitant to hire reply consp 9 hours agorootparentHaving short term contracts solved this a long time ago and is mostly a fallacy. reply Leherenn 7 hours agorootparentShort term contracts have pretty big downsides though. It's basically impossible to get a mortgage on a short term contract, or more generally any kind of loan. Even renting is difficult. That's why many EU countries have pretty strict limitations on short term contracts, like how many you can do in a row. It results in a huge reliance on contractors. reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentprevShort term contracts are basically taking the entirety of the ‘shit’ end of the stick for someone else, and are way worse than the median tech job in the US conditions wise. reply refurb 8 hours agorootparentprevHow is a short term contract a solution?

I heard that wges are less than 50% but you end up saving more reply rsynnott 8 hours agorootparentThis actually used not be the case. About six years ago I was in San Francisco for work, and was surprised how inexpensive it was. Like, it wasn’t cheap, but I’d heard it talked up as basically the most expensive place in the world, and it was largely cheaper than Dublin. Going back recently, it’s a _lot_ more expensive; home has gotten more expensive too, but not at the same rate. (Some of this is due to the currency thing, of course; the dollar was about as weak as it ever got post-financial crisis in 2018.) reply maccard 7 hours agorootparentYour mistake there is comparing to Dublin - I live in an expensive Uk city (Edinburgh) and it’s just incredible how expensive going home to Dublin is. The other bit is that you’re comparing living in Dublin to visiting SF. Rental prices in SF make Dublin seem cheap. You’re still probably financially better off living in SF as an engineer, but I’d rather the quality of life of Ireland/Europe reply rsynnott 7 hours agorootparentOh, sure, like I’m not saying SF was ever _cheap_, but it used to be in the same range of cost as Dublin (a very expensive European city); now it’s way more expensive. > Rental prices in SF make Dublin seem cheap Oh, yeah, they definitely do _now_, but pre-Covid it wasn’t as clear-cut. > You’re still probably financially better off living in SF as an engineer I think even that probably isn’t totally clear at this stage. If you’re in Big Tech(TM), you’re probably getting on the order of 60-70% pay in Dublin that you’d get in the same role in the same company in Silicon Valley (there’s some variation, but that’s about the usual ratio). If you have to pay SF rent or mortgage (plus property tax) with that, then you may not come ahead. If you can afford to buy outright or with a small mortgage, you’re probably doing better in SF, but even most big tech workers can’t afford that. (I think the pay gap probably is bigger outside big tech, tho) reply caskstrength 3 hours agorootparentprev> I heard that wges are less than 50% but you end up saving more Curios regarding how you came up with that conclusion. After paying rent, taxes and buying some groceries from EU senior engineer's ~80k you will generally have enough to maybe buy a new smartphone at the end of the year, not any meaningful amount of savings. reply raverbashing 5 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, true. But possibly not in the way people imagine People see the difference in wages, but what they miss is a) the amount of fees and extra expenses they have to pay that escape cost of living calculations, b) the \"natural\" lifestyle inflation that comes with living in the US (maybe summed up by the word consumerism), c) some size/low density related inefficiencies and d) things like educational costs Now, yes Europe makes it hard on itself a lot by being dumb (see HS2 costs soaring off or the failed German energy policy - not against renewable but their fee structure is stupid) reply mschuster91 9 hours agorootparentprev> Europe is CHEAP compared to America, it's fascinating. Yup. Cost of living is insanely low compared to the US, even when just comparing hotbeds like Silicon Valley vs London/Berlin/Munich, with the largest factor being housing. Additionally, healthcare costs are far lower as well - there is no such thing as co-pays, surprise bills and whatnot here (although I do admit some things like dental and vision care aren't covered by insurance, but generally still affordable). reply brabel 8 hours agorootparentInteresting, but as someone who visits the USA sometimes for short work/tourist trips, food and drinks are much cheaper pretty much anywhere except maybe California. And because that's most of what you spend on during short trips, not counting hotels (which are about the same price as Europe) to me the USA is a paradise of cheap drinks and large meals :D (but yeah, Europe wins on quality). reply TeMPOraL 9 hours agorootparentprev> You are effectively buying those labour protections with the difference in salary. FWIW, this is not as simple as labour protections being effectively equivalent to $29k. By being a legal requirement and not a choice, that $29k doesn't register to the market as using disposable income, so competitive pressure doesn't inflate prices of everything to compensate. It's strictly better than having a choice between $97k and $68k + labor protections. reply rsynnott 8 hours agorootparentAlso you are not taxed on that notional 29k, of course (this is one reason that companies often offer in excess of the statutory minimum paid leave etc; it’s essentially an un-taxable benefit). Given the choice between an extra week paid leave at your 100k a year job (notional value is ~2k) or a 2k raise, you’re probably better off taking the leave. reply AnthonyMouse 7 hours agorootparentprev> By being a legal requirement and not a choice, that $29k doesn't register to the market as using disposable income, so competitive pressure doesn't inflate prices of everything to compensate. In competitive markets prices approach the cost of production rather than absorbing all of the disposable income of the customer. If you have uncompetitive markets, that is a separate problem with its own solutions. And then you have the other problem. The job pays $29k less because it costs the company that much to avoid those costs, i.e. they're willing to pay that much more to someone in the US to do the same job. That doesn't mean you're getting $29k in value. Some of the money is going to compliance and administration rather than you. And in general money is worth more than stuff, because if you want the stuff you can buy it with money, but if you don't want that specific stuff then turning it back into money or other stuff at best incurs transaction costs and at worst isn't even achievable. The notion that you're not taxed on the stuff is also an illusion; the rules apply to everyone in the jurisdiction and the government needs however much money from people to provide the services it provides so if you're not paying it there you're either paying it somewhere else or getting fewer government services. reply ben_w 7 hours agorootparent> In competitive markets prices approach the cost of production rather than absorbing all of the disposable income of the customer. If you have uncompetitive markets, that is a separate problem with its own solutions. All markets are a bit uncompetitive — if they were not, if they were perfectly elastic and frictionless cows in a vacuum, then not only would anyone making a profit be undercut by someone willing to make less profit, a cycle which would repeat until profits became zero, but so too would wages be undercut by anyone else willing to provide the labour for less, with the same cycle driving income to subsistence + internet in our present case (or pennies per kloc when LLMs get better). reply cr1895 9 hours agorootparentprev>but we promise of course, who's to say that next quarter priorities of management or shareholders shift & those \"promises\" evaporate? reply less_less 9 hours agorootparentOf course you'd want to put those terms in the employment contract, not just a verbal promise. Surely you wouldn't get exactly the same protection as in another country with a completely different legal system, but at least you could get part of it.

This has to be some kind of a new level of idiocy. I mean, use AI to make junk sci-fi stories, and generate fake authors all day. But going for a book about mushrooms deserves a special stupidity and evilness award. reply throwanem 22 hours agorootparentIt probably could be automated to a point where there's no human even in the loop here: I wonder if books about mushroom identification are trending in Amazon UK sales lately, or something like that. No excuse, obviously. But it could explain how whoever's running the scam could have run it off this cliff - probably others, too. It's been a couple years since I bought even paper books off Amazon. Used should theoretically be closer to OK, but eBay sellers are cheaper and much more trustworthy. reply CM30 23 hours agoprevThis is why generative AI simply doesn't work for anything with actual consequences. As it is right now, it's a glorified autocomplete, and one that doesn't understand the context it's being used in at all. That's fine for things like stock images or text on random product pages, but for things like this?

It's a Reddit \"LegalAdvice\" thread. It's not morel season in the UK right now; false morels are also March-May produce. reply paulgb 22 hours agoparentI generally distrust Reddit threads, but it's entirely plausible to me. I was once gifted a cookbook on Amazon that was full of pre-LLM \"sludge\" of suspect internet-collected recipes along with a stock photo of an author with fake credentials (her author page is still up, although her books have been pulled and apparently she's a man now https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B0716Q2Y4Z/about) When I left a negative review pointing out that the author was a stock photo (entire content: \"The author of this book is a fraud. There is no Tina B. Baker, she is a stock photo.\"), Amazon pulled the review saying it violated their guidelines. reply alexey-salmin 22 hours agorootparentSure, but a fact of a story being plausible not only increases a probability of it being true, but also increases a probability of someone faking it because it's so plausible. Chances that someone would do exactly that on reddit are very high. reply pflenker 23 hours agoparentprevThe poster doesn’t claim they ate morels. The section about morels was an example for something unrelated to the poisoning. reply tptacek 22 hours agorootparentThe fact that these people claim mushroom poisoning but don't say what kind of mushrooms they were looking for makes you... more? less? willing to buy the story? They mentioned morels, which are sort of plausible (dates excepted) since false morels aren't going to kill you. What kind of mushroom would they be hunting in late July where their poisoning wouldn't be actually-newsworthy? reply pflenker 22 hours agorootparentI really have no opinion here at all. I just wanted to point out that the fact that it’s no morel season in the UK is no evidence in either direction since the post doesn’t claim that the poisoning was due to morels. I saw a comparable post the other day about an LLM proposing to mix garlic and oil in a way that would have produced a poisonous fluid, which the author recognized before trying. I found that story, and I find this one, at least plausible. reply bee_rider 22 hours agorootparentprevThey might be novices who got the book as the start of their search, right? Since it could have any type of AI hallucinated mushroom with any type of AI hallucinated description. Are there really no non-deadly mushrooms in the UK in the late July?

It’s the Wild West out there on social networks. reply joe_the_user 22 hours agoparentThis feels just because while people who know just bit about plants might do some dumb things, mushrooms are a thing that anyone who knows a bit about plants knows not to screw with because it's easy to poison oneself and the results are horrible.

I'd at least expect a reputable journalist to pick up on this story if there really was anything to it. Regardless of the veracity of the claims in that post, there's not much new here aside from the fact that the distributor generated the content using AI rather than making it up themselves. Quackery and snake oil has always been a thing, and plenty of people have been seriously injured or died from misinformation about food safety or medicine. The next time someone hesitates to seek professional medical attention for a problem because they got a blessing from the elders at their church and they think God will heal them as soon as they start having more faith, we can start talking about where we can really draw the line between personal responsibility and holding liars liable. reply dvh 22 hours agoprevI am of the opinion that you should only be hunting mushrooms if your family has been hunting mushrooms for generations (I could count 4+ in my family). Or at least spend few years under some patronage. This is not something you should learn from books.

Some mushrooms are very easily mistaken for others: unless you're 100% sure you've picked this very species before in around the same place and time, you'd better leave it there or bring it to a mycologist for identification. reply mcbuilder 22 hours agorootparentI agree, I always thought eating mushrooms required an expert for confirmation, otherwise you are rolling the dice. Buying a random book off Amazon and using that seems like the very definition of something a non-expert would do. reply culebron21 22 hours agorootparentYou simply steer away from those that are easy to misidentify. There aren't that many species in any given area, and those that look like poisonous are few, and well known. In my childhood, when we lived in real suburbia, with woods in 5 minutes of walk or right at the door, we routinely gathered mushrooms, and never had a problem. We stopped it when we moved to other places, or probably because adolescence came around -- probably, parents had taken us for an interesting kind of walk, and then we'd not want it anymore. Right now I can only recall some names of mushrooms and only sure of one species, so I won't risk at all. reply mcbuilder 15 hours agorootparentI was lucky enough to live next to a patch of morals as a kid.

Is it by design? Is this some dark campaign to stifle open source LLM development? Some mushrooms are horribly poisonous. That's the nature into which we were born. It's not a consequence of policy, and won't be fixed by policy. People need to learn to be careful about sources of information, with care in proportion to consequences. State intervention will preclude that evolutionary step, almost certainly without actually ameliorating the problem. reply meroes 22 hours agoparentI’ve watched so many communities devolve because of rage bait, which is often AI generated.

    "title": "Just use Postgres",
    "originLink": "https://mccue.dev/pages/8-16-24-just-use-postgres",
    "originBody": "Just use Postgres by: Ethan McCue This is one part actionable advice, one part question for the audience. Advice: When you are making a new application that requires persistent storage of data, like is the case for most web applications, your default choice should be Postgres. Why not sqlite? sqlite is a pretty good database, but its data is stored in a single file. This implies that whatever your application is, it is running on one machine and one machine only. Or at least one shared filesystem. If you are making a desktop or mobile app, that's perfect. If you are making a website it might not be. There are many success stories of using sqlite for a website, but they mostly involve people who set up their own servers and infrastructure. Platforms as a service-s like Heroku, Railway, Render, etc. generally expect you to use a database accessed over network boundary. It's not wrong to give up some of the benefits of those platforms, but do consider if the benefits of sqlite are worth giving up platform provided automatic database backups and the ability to provision more than one application server. The official documentation has a good guide with some more specifics. Why not DynamoDB, Cassandra, or MongoDB? Wherever Rick Houlihan is, I hope he is having a good day. I watch a lot of conference talks, but his 2018 DynamoDB Deep Dive might be the one I've watched the most. I know very few of you are going to watch an hour-long talk, but you really should. It's a good one. The thrust of it is that databases that are in the same genre as DynamoDB - which includes Cassandra and MongoDB - are fantastic if - and this is a load bearing if: You know exactly what your app needs to do, up-front You know exactly what your access patterns will be, up-front You have a known need to scale to really large sizes of data You are okay giving up some level of consistency This is because this sort of database is basically a giant distributed hash map. The only operations that work without needing to scan the entire database are lookups by partition key and scans that make use of a sort key. Whatever queries you need to make, you need to encode that knowledge in one of those indexes before you store it. You want to store users and look them up by either first name or last name? Well you best have a sort key that looks like $. Your access patterns should be baked into how you store your data. If your access patterns change significantly, you might need to reprocess all of your data. It's annoying because, especially with MongoDB, people come into it having been sold on it being a more \"flexible\" database. Yes, you don't need to give it a schema. Yes, you can just dump untyped JSON into collections. No, this is not a flexible kind of database. It is an efficient one. With a relational database you can go from getting all the pets of a person to getting all the owners of a pet by slapping an index or two on your tables. With this genre of NoSQL, that can be a tall order. Its also not amazing if you need to run analytics queries. Arbitrary questions like \"How many users signed up in the last month\" can be trivially answered by writing a SQL query, perhaps on a read-replica if you are worried about running an expensive query on the same machine that is dealing with customer traffic. It's just outside the scope of this kind of database. You need to be ETL-ing your data out to handle it. If you see a college student or fresh grad using MongoDB stop them. They need help. They have been led astray. Why not Valkey? The artist formerly known as Redis is best known for being an efficient out-of-process cache. You compute something expensive once and slap it in Valkey so all 5 or so HTTP servers you have don't need to recompute it. However, you can use it as your primary database. It stores all its data in RAM, so it's pretty fast if you do that. Obvious problems: You can only have so much RAM. You can have a lot more than you'd think, but its still pretty limited compared to hard drives. Same as the DynamoDB-likes, you need to make concessions on how you model your data. Why not Datomic? If you already knew about this one, you get a gold star. Datomic is a NoSQL database, but it is a relational one. The \"up-front design\" problems aren't there, and it does have some neat properties. You don't store data in tables. It's all \"entity-attribute-value-time\" (EAVT) pairs. Instead of a person row with id, name, and age you store 1 :person/name \"Beth\" and 1 :person/age 30. Then your queries work off of \"universal\" indexes. You don't need to coordinate with writers when making queries. You query the database \"as-of\" a given time. New data, even deletions (or as they call them \"retractions\"), don't actually delete old data. But there are some significant problems It only works with JVM languages. Outside of Clojure, a relatively niche language, its API sucks. If you structure a query badly the error messages you get are terrible. The whole universe of tools that exist for SQL just aren't there. Why not XTDB? Clojure people make a lot of databases. XTDB is spiritually similar do Datomic but: There is an HTTP api, so you aren't locked to the JVM. It has two axes of time you can query against. \"System Time\" - when records were inserted - and \"Valid Time.\" It has a SQL API. The biggest points against it are: It's new. Its SQL API is something that popped up in the last year. It recently changed its whole storage model. Will the company behind it survive the next 10 years? Who knows! Okay that's just one point. I'm sure I could think of more, but treat this as a stand-in for any recently developed database. The best predictor something will continue to exist into the future is how long it has existed. COBOL been around for decades, it will likely continue to exist for decades. If you have persistent storage, you want as long a support term as you can get. You can certainly choose to pick a newer or experimental database for your app but, regardless of technical properties, that's a risky choice. It shouldn't be your default. Why not Kafka? Kafka is an append only log. It can handle TBs of data. It is a very good append only log. It works amazingly well if you want to do event sourcing type stuff with data flowing in from multiple services maintained by multiple teams of humans. But: Up to a certain scale, a table in Postgres works perfectly fine as an append only log. You likely do not have hundreds of people working on your product nor TBs of events flowing in. Making a Kafka consumer is a bit more error-prone than you'd expect. You need to keep track of your place in the log after all. Even when maintained by a cloud provider (and there are good managed Kafka services) its another piece of infrastructure you need to monitor. Why not ElasticSearch? Is searching over data the primary function of your product? If yes, ElasticSearch is going to give you some real pros. You will need to ETL your data into it and manage that whole process, but ElasticSearch is built for searching. It does searching good. If no, Postgres will be fine. A sprinkling of ilike and the built-in full text search is more than enough for most applications. You can always bolt on a dedicated search thing later. Why not MSSQL or Oracle DB? Genuine question you should ask yourself: Are these worth the price tag? I don't just mean the straight-up cost to license, but also the cost of lock-in. Once your data is in Oracle DB you are going to be paying Oracle forever. You are going to have to train your coders on its idiosyncrasies, forever. You are going to have to decide between enterprise features and your wallet, forever. I know its super unlikely that you will contribute a patch to Postgres, so I won't pretend that there is some magic \"power of open source\" going on, but I think you should have a very specific need in mind to choose a proprietary DB. If you don't have some killer MSSQL feature that you simply cannot live without, don't use it. Why not MySQL? This is the one that I need some audience help with. MySQL is owned by Oracle. There are features locked behind their enterprise editions. To an extent you will have lock-in issues the same as any other DB. But the free edition MySQL has also been used in an extremely wide range of things. It's been around for a long time. There are people who know how to work with it. My problem is that I've only spent ~6 months of my professional career working with it. I genuinely don't know enough to compare it intelligently to Postgres. I'm convinced it isn't secretly so much better that I am doing folks a disservice when telling them to use Postgres, and I do remember reading about how Postgres generally has better support for enforcing invariants in the DB itself, but I wouldn't mind being schooled a bit here. Why not some AI vector DB? Most are new. Remember the risks of using something new. AI is a bubble. A load-bearing bubble, but a bubble. Don't build a house on it if you can avoid it. Even if your business is another AI grift, you probably only need to import openai. Why not Google Sheets? You're right. I can't think of any downsides. Go for it. <- Index",

The example of a website is actually a pretty poor one, since any website that needs to scale beyond a single box has many options. The two easiest ones are: - Mix static and dynamic content generation (and let's face it, most websites are mostly static from a server perspective) - Designate a writer node and use any of the multiple SQLite replication features But, in short, if you use an ORM that supports both SQLite and Postgres you'll have the option to upgrade if your site brings in enough traffic. Which might never happen, and in that case you have a trivial backup strategy and no need to maintain, secure and tweak a database server. reply vbezhenar 7 hours agoparentYou don't need to maintain, secure and tweak postgres any more than you would with SQLite. Just install it and it'll work. Postgres backup is a single command. And actually you're supposed to create sqlite backups with special command as well, if you're copying a file, you're doing it wrong. I really don't see any cons with Postgres over SQLite for server applications. reply nh2 1 hour agorootparent> You don't need to maintain, secure Of course you need to maintain postgres. Major version upgrades are not automatic, you can't just install a newer binary/library version and start it as you can for SQLite. You need to shut down the DB and run `pg_upgrade`, or write manual full export-import scripts with `pg_dump`/`pg_dumpall`/`pg_restore`/`psql`. And good luck deciding between the different format options, as some of them are unsupported across some of these tools, some cannot export and reimport the full database cluster, there's no idempotent \"just import this snapshot\" operation (point-in-time restore), lack of progress reporting, etc. Here are some notes I on the topic: # Note on Postgres backups # # Unfortunately, postgres backup+restore is not straightforward. # # * Backups created with `pg_dumpall`, which create an .sql file, # cannot simply be used for point-in-time recovery. # They need to be restored with `psql` (not `pg_restore`), # which errors if the data already exists. # * You could probably tell it to ignore errors, but naturally it'll just # run through `INSERT ...`, so it's not a proper point-in-time recovery, # because it doesn't remove data newer than the backup as expected. # * To use `pg_restore` (which can ignore existing data, re-creating # everything with the `--clean` flag), you need to use `pg_dump` # (not `pg_dumpall`), which cannot backup *all* databases, # only a single given one. # * Further, `pg_restore` does not accept `--format=plain` SQL backups # (the default created by `pg_dump`). Only the non-plain backups are # accepted, which are less readable for a human to determine whether # a given backup is the one desired to restore based on the data. # # As a result, we aim for restoration using `pg_restore --clean`, # backing up only the `postgres` database using `pg_dump -d postgres`. # This works for us because we currently store all our tables in the # `postgres` database. # We use `--format=tar` because it is a plain text format, which # * deduplicates better than compressed formats, and # * allows a human to `grep` in plain text for desired contents. Why isn't there a mode with which I can just tell postgres to migrate my data automatically upon startup with a newer version? And why can't I just have postgres-as-a-library to link into my binary, like I can do with SQLite? You also can't just run postgres as root (e.g. in a container), and have to set up UNIX users to work around that, because postgres has it hardcoded to avoid running as root. This, too, you don't need to do with SQLite. Also, postgres is harder to secure. You need to either use TCP and ensure that other UNIX users on the same system can't just connect, or use UNIX Domain Sockets which have a 108 char path length restriction [1] (which is of course not documented in postgres's docs [2]), so it will suddenly break your CI when its path changes from /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/my-branch-name/postgres/sockets/.s.PGSQL.5432 to /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/my-longer-branch-name-for-additional-cool-feature-12456/postgres/sockets/.s.PGSQL.5432 And then you need to tell people to use shorter branch name \"because otherwise the DB doens't work\".

That's not true. Postgres is another standalone process, SQLite is a library.

It might if you run out of disk space, but that is going to be a bad time with any database. It is not \"competing for resources\" when it is running the workload your app is sending it.

It’s all shades of grey when you’re building: Should I put my queue in my DB and just avoid the whole 2PC drama (saga is a more apt word but too much opportunity for confusion in this context). I probably should implement that check constraint or that trigger but should I add a plugin to my DB to offer better performance and correctness of special type X or just use a trigger for that too? Should I create my own db plugin so that triggers can publish messages themselves without going through an app layer? In retrospect it’s easy to see when you went too far, or not far enough. At decision time the design document your team are refining starts to head past the ~10 page sweet spot limit. reply sampullman 6 hours agorootparentThat's true, even with \"perfect\" abstractions, switching gets more complicated as you use more complex database features. It's only really easy if you push most of your constraints and triggers to the application. In practice, I've only ever switched databases with really simple CRUD stuff and have otherwise been able to predict that I'll eventually want Postgres/RabbitMQ/etc and build it in from the start. reply rmsaksida 6 hours agoparentprevIMO a downside of SQLite that isn't discussed as often as it should be is the poor support for some table operations like ALTER COLUMN.

My database and Postgres are _literally_ the core definition of everything that my application does. My app is written in Rust, but that doesn't matter because it's a _Postgres_ application. I use Postgres-specific features extensively. Converting the application to SQLite would be essentially a re-write, and it would be worse in every way. Also, I generally just don't understand this fad of running production backends on SQLite. SQLite is great for what it is, a tiny little embeddable client-side database. But it is a _terrible_ database for non trivial business applications where ref integrity, real types instead of \"everything is a string\", and battle-tested scaling is essential. reply sampullman 6 hours agorootparentI don't think people often switch from Postgres to SQLite, it's probably more common (and much easier) to prototype with SQLite lite first and then switch. If by referential integrity you just mean FK constraints, you can turn that on in sqlite3. I think SQLite is pretty good for a lot of use cases. An Axum/sqlite CRUD app should be able to handle at least few hundred requests per second on a medium powered box, which is good enough for a lot of things.

The first is that I consider everything remotely owned by Oracle as a business risk. Personal opinion and maybe too harsh, but Oracle licenses are made to be violated accidentially so you can be sued and put on the license hook once you're audited, try as you might. But besides that, Postgres gives you more tools to keep your data consistent and the extension world can save a lot of dev-time with very good solutions. For example, we're often exporting tenants at an SQL level and import somewhere else. This can turn out very weird if those are 12 year old on-prem tenants. MySQL in such a case has you turn of all foreign key validations and whatever happens happens. A lot of fun with every future DB migration is what happens. With Postgres, you just turn on deferred foreign key validation. That way it imports the dump, eventually complains and throws it all away. No migration issues in the future. Or the overall tooling ecosystem around PostgreSQL just feels more mature and complete to me at least. HA (Patroni and such), Backups (pgbackrest, ...), pg_crypto, pg_partman and so on just offer a lot of very mature solutions to common operational and dev-issues. reply azurelake 7 hours agoparentMySQL has a very mature open source HA story with the flavors of group replication, as well as being able to replicate DDL.

You need more scripts, more tooling, more knowledge of DBA, and that may not be necessary. When you're using a database to store a few thousand rows of data, Postgres quickly becomes overkill. Postgres is a V8 engine when all you may need to power is a lawn mower. I personally prefer to use abstractions like ORMs for most of my database interactions, and direct SQL when those abstractions get in the way (by generating expensive queries and not finding an easy fix without a large refactor). This way, starting out with sqlite (good enough for most websites I reckon, easy to backup) doesn't interfere with any necessary migration to postgres (like when the need for scaling arises). This also makes setting up tests easier (except for the manually written SQL) because starting an application with a temporary in-memory database is a lot faster than starting a full container. Unless I'm doing native apps, I'll probably always want to reserve the ability to use Postgres. Sometimes that means hooking up a Postgres account and such, but often that just means sticking with sqlite and leaving my options open for when sqlite doesn't work anymore. reply wonrax 5 hours agorootparent> Postgres isn't hard to use, but it requires maintenance.

You can play this game “just use XYZ and have no problems”, but it isn’t realistic. Production databases at scale require heavy dedicated infra to stay highly available and performant, and even out of the box solutions require you to understand what is going on and tune them else you run into “surprises” which are almost always that no one RTFM.

A lot of the time, even though I mostly use Postgres, the DB and the application are on the same server, which gets rid of the difficulties of working over a network (more configuration, more security issues, more maintenance).

Then of course over time I realized you still need to maintain a schema over time and provide someway to “upgrade” data when your schema evolves, and keep your data consistent. Then I discovered the tools around migrating mongo data are not nearly as mature as the ones you’ll find for SQL databases.

Instead, figure out what you need based on your app. Recently I had the opportunity to rewrite an application from scratch in a new language. This was a career first for me and I won't go into the why aspect. Anyway, the v1 of the app used SQL and v2 was written against MongoDb. I planned the data access patterns based on knowledge that my DB was effectively document/key/value. The end result: it is much simpler. The v1 DB had like 100+ tables with lots of relations and needs lots of documentation. The v2 DB has like 10 \"tables\" (or whatever mongo calls them) yet does the same thing. Granted, I could have made 10 equivalent SQL tables as well but this would have defeated the purpose of using SQL in the first place. This isn't to say MongoDB is \"better\". If I had tons of fancy queries and relations I needed it would be easier with SQL, but for this particular app, it is a MUCH better choice. TL;DR Don't default to anything, look at your requirements and make an intelligent choice. reply christkv 7 hours agoprevReally just reads as an article reaffirming his own bias. For Mongo at least most of it is wrong. - Secondaries are read replicas and you can specify if you want to read from them using the drivers selecting that you are ok with eventual consistency. - You can shard to get a distributed system but for small apps you will probably never have to. Sharing can also be geo specific so you query for french data on the french shards etc lowering latency while keeping a global unified system. - JSON schema can be used to enforce integrity on collections. - You can join but this I definitely don’t recommend if possible. - I personally like the pipeline concept for queries and wish there was something like this for relational databases to make writing queries easier. - The AI query generator based on the data using Atlas has reduced the pain of writing good pipelines. Chat gpt helps a lot here too. - The change streams are awesome and has let us create a unified trigger system that works outside of the database and it’s easy to use.

As a part of that I've been taught that the only part you could trust then is your internal modules - and even database has to treated as an external source, whose only job is to pull data in and out. How does that work in what you're suggesting? Is it just a different way of approaching things that will work depending on what's your goal is? I'm just curious about this as I'm trying to get myself to learn a bit more, just to clarify reply tazu 7 hours agorootparentThe model described in the parent comment is essentially using the database (in this case PostgreSQL, but any RDMS would do) as the hexagonal \"core\" in which adapters plug in to. This is a powerful pattern that works very well when you use the full features of the RDMS like constraints, triggers, views, etc. This does require \"coupling\" to the RDMS-specific features, which makes migrating to an alternative system difficult, but in practice this rarely happens if you choose a strong RDMS from the beginning. You can certainly use the database as a \"dumb storage\" tool in the hexagonal architecture, that is, as just another adapter. But most of the time you'll end up re-creating RDMS features in poorly written/documented application code that has to interact with the database anyways. Why not just do it all in the database? With a RDMS core, hexagonal adapters can be pure functional components, making them much easier to reason about and maintain. For more on this idea, and how to avoid pitfalls with the hexagonal pattern, I recommend reading Out of the Tar Pit [1].

You probably don’t want some reporting or dashboard functionality in your app to have to pull tens or hundreds of thousands of rows to the back end, just because you have decided to iterate over the dataset and do some transformations there. That said, I’ve worked in an app where the Java back end only called various stored procedures and displayed their results in tables and while it was blazingly fast, the developer experience was miserable compared to most other projects I’ve worked with - lots of tables with bad naming (symbol limits in that RDBMS to thank), badly commented (not) procedures with obscure flags, no way to step through anything with a debugger, no proper logging, no versioning or good CI tooling, no good tools for code navigation, no refactoring suggestions, no good tracing or metrics, nothing. Sure, it might have just been a bad codebase, but it was worse than most of the ones where too much logic is in the back end, those just run badly, so I get the other category of opinions, which suggests that trying to use the DB for everything isn’t a walk in the park either. There’s probably a good balance to be found and using tools in ways that both perform okay and don’t make the developer experience all that bad. reply StefanBatory 7 hours agorootparentThank you :) reply KronisLV 4 hours agorootparentOfc I reserve the right to be wrong, just wanted to share my subjective experience, that there can be tradeoffs and there probably aren't any silver bullets. For the most part, I think that you should put any mass/batch processing in the DB (just comment/version/test/deploy your code like you would on the back end, as best as you can with the tools available to you) and don't sweat too much about handling the CRUD operations in your back end, through whatever ORM you use or don't use (regular queries are also fine, as long as parametrized to prevent injection). For complex schemas, a nice approach I've found is making one DB view per table/list/section of your front end, so you only need 1 DB call to load a particular component, otherwise the N+1 risk gets far greater (\"Oh hey, I got this list of orders, but each other needs a delivery status, so I'll just iterate over those and fetch them for each item, whoops, the DB is spammed with requests.\"). Good luck! reply poorlyknit 7 hours agorootparentprevNot OP, but I think it's a valid approach. You gain: Model consistency guaranteed by the database, your backend basically only acts as an external API for the database. You lose: Modularity, makes it harder to swap out databases. Also, you have to write SQL for business logic which many developers are bad at or dislike or both. I've seen a system running on this approach for ten years and it survived three generations of developers programming against this API. There's Python wx frontends, web frontends, Rust software, Java software, C software, etc. They all use the same database procedures for manipulating the model so it stays consistent. Postgres is (kinda, not very) heavy for small projects but it scales for medium up to large-ish projects (where it still scales but not as trivially). One downside I've seen in this project is that some developers were afraid to change the SQL procedures so they started to work around them instead of adding new ones or changing the existing ones. So in addition to your regular work horse programming language you also have to be pretty good at SQL. reply StefanBatory 7 hours agorootparentThat's interesting way of doing things, I'll admit. Thank you for helping out :) reply Kinrany 7 hours agorootparentprevWith Pglite in a few years you'll be able to treat Postgres as a library, and merely allow selecting between in-process and remote via configuration. The first job of a database is to be a data structure for persisting data, but you're allowed to extend said data structure in your own code. As long as you can come up with a way to keep all the code in version control, test it, etc., it's fine. reply worik 8 hours agoparentprev> People replying saying \"only use generic SQL so you cans switch databases!\" - to that I say - rubbish! No, not rubbish Portability matters. Lockin sucks reply hit8run 8 hours agoprevJust use SQLite3. You will with 99.99% chance never need more. Now what? reply dmezzetti 7 hours agoprevI'm always cautious with a one-size-fits-all approach. If a team is working on a small project and SQLite works then great. You can use a SQLite database on something like a $4/month DigitalOcean droplet. Can't say the same for Postgres. > AI is a bubble Many say this but Generative AI and LLMs have gotten bunched up with everything else. There is a clear need for vectors and multimodal search. There is no core SQL statement to find concepts within an image for example. Machine learning models support that with arrays of numbers (i.e. vectors). pgvector adds vector storage and similarity search for Postgres. There was a recent post about storing vectors in SQLite (https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec). > Even if your business is another AI grift, you probably only need to import openai. There's much more than this. There are frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex and txtai (disclaimer I'm the primary author of https://github.com/neuml/txtai) that handle generating embeddings locally or with APIs and storing them in databases such as Postgres. reply jononor 6 hours agoparentWhy can't you run Postgres on a 4 USD droplet? They seem to have 512 MB RAM, that is enough for a basic Postgres instance and a HTTP application server. reply dom96 8 hours agoprevThis should be titled \"Just use Sqlite\", you really rarely need anything more unless you're Google or Facebook. reply bob1029 8 hours agoprev [–] There is absolutely no reason you can't make SQLite go all the way. Starting with it is the only thing that makes sense to me. It is certainly a higher performance solution in the fair comparison of a hermetically sealed VM using SQLite vs application server + Postgres instance + Ethernet cable. We're talking 3-4 orders of magnitude difference in latency. It's not even a contest. There are also a lot of resilience strategies for SQLite that work so much better. For instance, you can just snapshot your VM in AWS every x minutes. This doesn't work for some businesses, but you can also use one of the log replication libraries (perhaps in combination with snapshots). If snapshots work for your business, it's the most trivial thing imaginable to configure and use. Hosted SQL solutions will never come close to this level of simplicity. I personally got 4 banks to agree to the snapshot model with SQLite for a frontline application. Losing 15 minutes of state was not a big deal given that we've still not had any outages related to SQLite in the 8+ years we've been using it in prod. reply cloogshicer 8 hours agoparentSurprised to hear that losing 15 min of state is not a big deal in a banking context. I haven't worked with banks before, genuinely curious, how do they recover from something like this? Wouldn't this potentially destroy all transactions made in that time period? reply viraptor 8 hours agorootparentTo be fair they said \"frontline application\", not a transaction processor specifically. Also in cases where you can't lose stuff it's common to use reliable steam processing, so maybe they can reprocess old events into the system running sqlite. (This is extra general info about \"important systems\"; I don't know what OP is running) reply cloogshicer 7 hours agorootparentAh, maybe I just don't know what \"frontline application\" means in this context. reply sorokod 7 hours agorootparentprevAt best this will increase the load on customer support with an associated reputational hit. At worst you will need to deal with questions from financial regulators. In all cases, rubbish customer experience. reply viraptor 8 hours agoparentprev> There is absolutely no reason you can't make SQLite go all the way. No reason you can't, but one you to consider if you should. If you're using libraries which make assumptions about your database layer, they may not like the sqlite model. Holding the writer mode for too long is something I experienced in write a few projects. For example paperless-ngx will block the web interface while batch importing documents, even though there's really no reason to do that. It's less of an issue if you write all your own code and you explicitly target sqlite. But worth keeping in mind. reply codeflo 8 hours agoparentprevWhy would you run Postgres on a different box in such a scenario? A docker run command to get a Postgres instance up and running isn’t any more complicated than linking in Sqlite, maybe even simpler. And you get proper ACID transactions for free. reply rcarmo 8 hours agorootparent1) Fault isolation in case of hardware failure 2) You may not even be able to _think_ about using Docker (OS restrictions, airgaps to install images, etc.) These are just 2 that come to mind from working in regulated industries. reply codeflo 7 hours agorootparentIn this thread, we're making a comparison to running Sqlite. Fault isolation is not an argument. And you don't have to run Docker to run Postgres, it's just an easy way to do so. Even airgapped. reply rcarmo 7 hours agorootparentIn my experience, people running airgapped systems prefer OS packages and prebuilt images rather than even considering doing Docker pulls reply rcarmo 3 hours agorootparentprevI don't get the downvotes here. These are real world constraints. reply emccue 6 hours agoparentprevSure. I think the caveats I mentioned are real though. Using SQLite locks you out of some platforms as a service and out of some application architectures. It also means you need to be doing stuff like snapshotting your VM every x minutes. Given minimal certainty about the scale, future, and properties of your application and organization: Postgres is the better default. reply Kinrany 8 hours agoparentprevWith Pglite it should now be possible to have the cake of Postgres' rich functionality and embed it too reply jddj 8 hours agorootparent*in nodejs (for now) reply Kinrany 7 hours agorootparentFamous last words, but it's already in a Wasm module and only needs a bit of glue code, so how hard could it be? :D reply winrid 6 hours agoparentprev [–] The latency advantage is nothing compared to the advantage you can get with a better query planner. reply Consider applying for YC's first-ever Fall batch!

It helps solidify their knowledge, and helps us double check that they understood, and it’s something they can contribute when they still haven’t become part of the bus number on anything yet. That all sounds reasonable and smart, but the real reason I do it is the Curse of Knowledge. People in a system can’t see it from the outside. They make assumptions, use opaque or even misleading jargon, and employ circular logic. The new guy doesn’t know the lingo, or the circular logic. Their explanation will make more sense to the next hire than anything I can say. And having it written down this way can also give me new perspective on the system.

You get a tiny window of watching them struggle until the tribal team knowledge seeps into them by osmosis. During that time they don't yet know who to ask the questions to directly so they will post to team slack channels or the lead directly. One must capitalize on this brief period because smart programmers are flexible and adaptable. Very quickly they will acclimatize themselves to the mess that surrounds them and they will become as blind to the deficiencies as the rest of the team. reply huhtenberg 45 minutes agoparentprevThe expression goes \"to know is to be able to explain\". reply riiii 9 minutes agorootparentYes, but there are plenty of exceptions.

Thank you! reply practicemaths 2 hours agorootparentprevWhat is consider efficient if it yields less best results? I understand time constraints and end goals may prohibit the 'best' approach. What I do not understand is how can you say something is more 'efficient' if the yield in understanding is less than what you would get with another method. Hopefully this will clarify my thought process here: If 'Best' is to teach others and requires 10,000 hours to yield 90-99% understanding. In contrast, 'Efficient' method requires 2,500 hours to yield 30-40% understanding. However, there is diminishing returns meaning that doubling your hours to 5,000 does not return you with 60-80% understanding, rather maybe closer to 50-60% understanding. With 7,500 hours closer to 65-70% and 10,000 hours may around 75-89% understanding. Here you've spent the same amount of time but did not achieve the same level of understanding. I think you may have a dynamic 'Best' vs 'Efficient' curve and to switch between those options to optimize maximizing your level of understanding in the least amount of time. reply fn-mote 1 hour agorootparentThe problem I have with this argument is that you cannot consider \"efficiency\" in a vacuum. You need to have a metric against which to measure it. Consider these two scenarios - Goal: remember where to look up information when it comes up in $JOB Metric: how much you remember, how quickly you find the info Goal: discover new hyper-efficient method of training an AI (or insert popular ML topic here). Metric: percent improvement vs current pubished best practice (deliberately vague) Required understanding to make progress: \"like a Ph.D. from Stanford\" Now you can possibly measure something. The idea achievement of \"90% understanding\" is VERY topic dependent. Simple topic? Sure 100% understanding, I remembered the Latin names of all of the plants in my house. Complicated topic? The information for \"100% understanding\" might not even be written in the textbook - it probably includes things like seeing the interconnections between the topics and being able to apply them in slightly different contexts. Make sure you read the studies so you know what they're talking about. In this area, I think summaries are frequently misleading. You have to know what the real evidence is that substantiates the claims. (I cannot tell you how many times I have looked at the evidence and just rolled my eyes - obviously not applicable in settings where I wanted it to be.)

These studies and findings are almost entirely focused on simple recall knowledge (isolated facts, vocabulary). That's an important part of learning certainly and it informs research on learning higher order concepts but it's not the full story. Just to name one example, folks might look into research on conceptual change theory (eg Chi or Posner). This theory helps explain why a concept like electricity is so challenging to learn. The reason, in brief, being that naive conceptions make a category error and think of electricity as a thing rather than a process. And this theory then informs instructional practice. Specifically, teachers should be aware of difficult concepts and should design activities that force students to confront the contradictions between their naive models and more accurate/complete ones. Mickie Chi also has fascinations research on active learning (ICAP) and related work on the effectiveness of peer learning. reply closed 2 hours agorootparentprevFrom a more applied angle, a book like \"10 steps to complex learning\" might be helpful.

Yet surprisingly little is known about how long-term retention is most efficiently achieved. I've always thought that the real problem is information relevancy. People need practical uses for remembering something beyond synthetic bullshit exams. Efficient techniques are great, but nothing demotivates more than not having a reason to learn beyond being told that you have to. Nobody has to reach for flashcards, extensive notes, or advanced techniques when trying to learn something they're actually interested in, it's retained almost immediately and effortlessly. There has to be some kind of subconscious gauge of information relevancy that physically controls the level of absorption, a sort of \"learning rate\" if you will. reply james-revisoai 1 hour agoparentI agree motivation to learn and maintaining interest is key, to effect the learning rate you mention. The enjoyment itself, although a crucifying word to use in discussions when teaching students considered the \"best of the best\", still matters and predominates over the effectiveness factor for most of the semester for students, at least. Because of just being \"told to learn\" it. Basically 70% of the semester most students are not studying 40 hours - they are doing 30 hours of real work, and perhaps only 15 hours effectively. And for good reason: Nothing is bridging or rewarding them in a way that interests/motivates them, for courses where the interest isn't natural. A bridge to motivate them would be ideal. In 2021 I started using GPT-3 to generate motivational \"reasons to learn a concept\" cards for my flashcard app, - Revision.ai - which you can read about here in the 3rd item: https://www.revision.ai/articles/20ThingsRevisionAIDoesForBe... - the reason we disabled them was simple: we could never quite time the cards right to help the student when they needed it. When the app is closed, they aren't motivated - they don't see them. Mid study session? Showing such cards (or AI generated examples) interrupted the flow [https://www.instagram.com/p/CVVlIuVg31W/] We have also tried recommending relevant short/mid length youtube videos for visual/\"breaks\" from overwhelming learning. That did not boost student success either. I guess it doesn't address that you are still being told to do it, not naturally flowing into learning. I welcome any technical or conceptual ideas you have to improve this and help increase interest amongst students. We have found that turning lecture slideshows into sets of exercises with clear visuals[https://www.instagram.com/p/C5ByftwiJ00/], breaking content up, and showing progress does motivate students to study more(and in a semi-related dissertation I wrote, possibly reduce Test Anxiety and tension). Please let me know of any ideas you have! reply larsrc 1 hour agoparentprevI disagree. Motivation will keep you reading the material, but that alone will not make you remember it that much better. When you're motivated about something you can practice, you may remember more by doing it (which also acts a spaced repetition). But good luck trying that with, say, astrophysics or macroeconomics. When motivated, you're also more likely to pick up other books on the subject, which is another form of spaced repetition. reply jppope 2 hours agoprevReal question.

Next up for the flashcard part is to replace the SM2 algorithm with FSRS for the flashcards, as well as having flashcards get passively reviewed simply by reading content. I also suspect people are missing out on speed of learning when reviewing flashcards one at a time for hours. Besides actively recalling reviewing flashcards passively while reading, I’ll experiment with other review techniques like seeing a page at a time of vocab / revealable answers.

    "originBody": "It's still a mess — Epic Games Store and Fortnite arrive on EU iPhones Epic also launched its store on Android. Samuel Axon - 8/16/2024, 6:48 PM Enlarge / Artist's conception of Epic dodging harm from Apple's decisions (and perhaps its own). reader comments 184 It's been four years since Fortnite, one of the world's most popular games, was pulled from the Apple App Store in a blaze of controversy and finger-pointing. Today, it's returning to the iPhone—but only in the European Union. Today marks the launch of the Epic Games Store on Android and iOS—iOS just in Europe, Android worldwide. Right now, it just has three games: Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe, and Fall Guys. And you'll have to be in Europe to access it on your iPhone. The Epic Games Store is run by Epic Games, the same company that develops and publishes Fortnite. Most folks who have been paying attention to either Epic or Apple in recent years knows the story at this point, but here's the quick summary and analysis. Opinion: Users are still the losers after four years At the direction of CEO Tim Sweeney, Epic knowingly made changes to Fortnite related to digital payments that violated Apple's terms for developers on the platform. Apple removed Fortnite accordingly, and a long, ugly PR and legal battle ensued between the two companies in multiple countries and regions. In the US, a judge's decision granted some small wins to Epic and other developers seeking to loosen Apple's grip on the platform, but it kept the status quo for the most part. Things went a little differently in Europe. EU legislators and regulators enacted the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which had far-reaching implications for how Apple and Google run their app stores. Among other things, the new law required Apple to allow third-party, alternative app stores (basically, sideloading) on the iPhone. Apple's compliance was far from enthusiastic (the company cited security and privacy concerns for users, which is valid, but the elephant in the room is, of course, its confident grip on app revenues on its platforms), and it was criticized for trying to put up barriers. Additionally, Apple rejected Epic's attempts to launch its app store multiple times for a few arcane reasons amid a flurry of almost comically over-the-top tweets from Sweeney criticizing the company. Despite Apple's foot-dragging, Epic has finally reached the point where it could launch its app store. Epic had already launched a relatively successful App Store on PC, where Valve's Steam holds a strong grip on users. The new iPhone app store doesn't offer nearly as many options or perks as the PC version, but Epic says it's working on wrangling developers onto its store. It also says it will release its games on other alternative app stores on iOS and Android, such as AltStore PAL. It's been a long, winding, angry path to get to this point. In the battle between Epic and Apple, there remains some debate about who really has won up to this point. But there isn't much dispute that, whether you want to blame Apple or Epic or both, users sure haven't been the winners. reader comments 184 Samuel Axon Samuel Axon is a senior editor at Ars Technica.

Addons on both are just standard WebExtensions, and I've already noted that it runs both Chrome and Firefox extensions. https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions Your lack of understanding of what browser extensions are is exactly why it would be better if Apple explicitly banned browser extensions from the App Store. Ignorance is a malware vector, and even you, a commentator on Hacker News, do not understand the browser extension ecosystem. Instead, they're taking a bunch of flak for something they aren't even doing, all the while iOS has had a browser supporting uBO for years. reply cma 7 hours agorootparent\"I noticed similar issues. I think the reason is that Orion on iOS supports fewer Web Extension APIs than it does on desktop (see the list below). As far as I know, uBlock Origin makes heavy use of the webRequest API, and this seems to be mostly unsupported on iOS. So I decided for me to use uBlock Origin only with the Mac version and rely on Orion’s built-in content blocking on iOS.\" \"When using the uBlock Origin browser extension on iPhone or iPad, it is unable to block any ads or trackers on webpages. The displayed interception count always remains at 0.

On the other hand, from my experience with Android installation, providing easy steps for end users who don't know what they're agreeing with leads to lots of malware and other nasty stuff. Android has recently started blocking users from granting some sensitive permissions to apps from settings dialogues spawned by the app itself for this reason. You need to manually open the settings to grant the most sensitive permissions. This has the benefit of requiring the user to know what power they're granting these apps, but the process is a lot less straight-forward than this was on iOS. reply illiac786 5 hours agorootparentThe problem here (in the malware case) is that the user is not reading or understanding the warnings.

So there is an actual install flow going on in the background, in which Safari communicates with Settings, it's just specifically designed so you have to look up and open the Settings app yourself, instead of just opening it for you.

Can I install it while there? reply miki123211 6 hours agoparentExplaining in detail, since there's a lot of misinfo in this subthread. The new georestricted iOS features, like 3rd-party App Stores, are behind feature flags that only activate in certain regions. There are multiple factors taken into account when determining whether a flag should be activated. They include GPS location, location obtained from nearby cell towers, the issuing country of your SIM card, the region you set in settings, the country that nearby WiFi networks broadcast for regulatory purposes[1], and (indirectly, through the billing address) the issuing country of the credit or debit card that you use in the App Store. Not all of them have to match, but the threshold is high enough that you're very unlikely to meet it while physically in the US. Feature flags stay activated for 30 days since last eligibility, so if you're an EU resident and leave for a vacation, you're fine. If you traveled here as an US resident, you (probably) could get these features activated, perhaps needing an european Apple ID and/or SIM, but they would only stay on for 30 days. reply Etheryte 7 hours agoparentprevLast I checked, all app store regional limitations etc were tied to your billing address.

Introduction Usually, people start these ‘critiques’ with a disclaimer that they are not trying to trash the framework, and talk about how it’s a tradeoff. However, this is assumed - I’m not going to waste your time with that. Instead, I’ll focus on why PyTorch has been a net negative for all (if not most) scientific computing efforts, causing billions of dollars in lost productivity and thousands of wasted dev-hours. This is not because its a bad framework per-se, but rather - it simply because it wasn’t designed for the use-cases it’s being employed in right now. Ever since LuaTorch, PyTorch was supposed to be a “production ready, easy-to-use framework for quick prototyping”. It wasn’t meant to be deployed onto huge, distributed clusters comprising of thousands of interconnected nodes and GPUs and scale well in a fault-tolerant and robust matter. The guiding philosophy of Torch was never about scale - despite what their marketing may have you believe - but flexibility. In response to the rising need of a scalable and performant framework, DeepMind developed JAX to meet a simple goal: “… Supporting state-of-the-art AI research [by] balancing rapid prototyping and quick iteration with the ability to deploy experiments at a scale …” - JAX blogpost This post is about convincing you how important this idea/philosophy is not only for Deep Learning, but for all scientfic computing that needs to happen at scale. I believe that all infrastructure built on Torch is just a huge pile of technical debt, that will haunt the field for a long, long time. The Philosophy PyTorch’s philosophy has always, in some ways, been antithetical to that of Tensorflow’s. Where TF 1.x tried to be a static but performant framework by making strong use of the XLA compiler, PyTorch instead focused on being dynamic, easily debuggable and pythonic. Early on, the TF devs realized their mistakes when they came to realize how much the community hated the old 1.x API, which was counter-intuitive and introduced anti-pythonic patterns that were difficult to grasp for beginners. This prompted the core decision to use Keras as the main interface for TensorFlow and downplay the role of XLA compiler that was at TF’s core. The main focus was on cleaning up the frontend as much as possible. This was a huge mistake. Sure, the API did improve and worked well for some people - but only as long as your workloads were standard. Any deviations from the norm were punished by stacktrace dumps that were often literal pages of just garbled XLA-HLO that were a nightmare to debug unless you had a strong grasp on the internals of the framework/compiler - which you didn’t because XLA was a closed source, internal Google project at the time. In short, it had every hallmark of a typical Google product. Thus it comes as no surprise that people who switched over to PyTorch thought they had discovered literal heaven: I've been using PyTorch a few months now and I've never felt better. I have more energy. My skin is clearer. My eye sight has improved. — Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) May 26, 2017 PyTorch stuck to its roots. Unlike TensorFlow’s static & lazy approach, they took the bolder, more dynamic “eager” approach wherein all torch.Tensors were evaluated immediately, leading to a much more cleaner abstraction than TensorFlow’s. Clearly, they understood that complexity is the enemy of productivity. Instead of tacking on band-aids, they had pursued a fresh new path which paid off. Unsurprisingly, almost serious research moved to PyTorch: PyTorch vs. Tensorflow usage in research repos But in 2021 GPT-3 hit the scene and suddenly things started getting serious. All of a sudden, performance and scalability became the primary concern. PyTorch accomodated for this rising demand decently well, but because it wasn’t designed around this philosophy - slowly the debt starting catching up and the foundations started crumbling. It’s hard to reconcile flexibility with performance. Clearly, a tradeoff needed to be made. Either they could give their biggest and richest users exactly what they wanted - a clean & scalable ecosystem that prioritized performance - which would be a static-oriented TF-like design - or they could try to hold on to what made Torch so special in the first place - being dynamic and “eager” at the expense of performance, and somehow delegate those large-scale workloads to an entirely seperate technological stack. So the devs, being the smart and rational engineers they are, choose an appropriate compromise which was . . . . to pursue both paths simultaneously. They were unwilling to make any tradeoffs. They wanted their cake and were going to eat it too. The new approach was ultimately a chaotic mishmash of competing features. You have on one hand, PyTorch’s committment to eventually use some compiler (likely XLA) as a performant and reliable default backend and on the other, to build up their own entire torch.compile stack that somehow meshes well with the eager, dynamic philosophy by giving users the freedom to invoke a compiler if need be. This lack of real long-term strategy is a serious issue. Take the torch.compile stack and the new DTensor API as an example. The documentation is transparent about the inspiration for this feature. It tries to bring the sharding model of parallelization from JAX to PyTorch. … When using DTensor in a [distributed] fashion it might be … slower compared to existing solutions like DDP/FSDP. This is mainly because DDP/FSDP have a global view of the entire model … [and can thus] optimize for data parallel specifically … [whereas] DistributedTensor … can only optimize within individual tensor operations. To improve efficiency of DTensor-based data parallel training, we are exploring a compiler-based solution on top of DTensor. Leaning on the compiler is diametrically opposed to torch’s dynamic philosophy - because at each step, you’re restricted by the constraints placed by the compiler which you must obey. PyTorch clearly doesn’t want to commit to a compiler-centric philosophy (like JAX) but I don’t see any good alternative solutions - and frankly, I doubt the devs do either. Instead, what you end up getting getting is a fragmented suite of tools that’re barely usable without significant dev-hours sunk in just setting them up and coaxing them to work with each other. It’s considerable friction for research teams who often spend more of their time babysitting the codebase and triangulating random errors rather than running more experiments. I feel there is a stronger incentive internally on marketing and shipping ‘features’ rather than actually ensuring they integrate well into the ecosystem. It’s true that maintaining such a huge ecosystem will always have it’s problems, but the considering the case where devs shipped a built-in implementation of FSDP, and it didn’t work at all with their own torch.compile stack for months, really goes to show where their priorities lie. There is simply no excuse for two of your most core, critical features not working together at all. Users had to wait weeks before it was officially patched and the bugs were ironed out to the point of it being in a ususable state where is stands now. My point is that all these failures are systemic due to: a) bad organization and b) bad design decisions. So what is the competition’s solution to this problem? Compiler-driven development JAX leverages TensorFlow’s formidable compiler stack, XLA. XLA is a pretty powerful compiler, but the beauty is that it’s all abstracted away for the end user. For any function you have, as long as the function is pure (more on this later) you can use the simple @jax.jit decorator to JIT compile your function and make it available to XLA. You can jit any JAX code - XLA handles the rest. This is what makes JAX such a great framework for scientific computing - its effectively an eDSL built entirely around XLA. The compiler handles and abstracts away a lot of the heavy lifting for us - verifying that the generated graph is correct, GSPMD partitioner that handles the auto-parallelization w/ sharding in JAX, the graph optimizations, operator and kernel fusion, Latency hiding Scheduling, overlapping asynchronous comms, codegeneration to other backends such as triton etc. are all handled by XLA behind the scenes. This is a powerful approach. As long as your code obeys some simple JAX restrictions, XLA does this automatically for you. For example, you don’t need torch.distributed.barrier() and other comms primitives when doing parallelization. DDP support is as simple as: # Create a Sharding object to distribute a value across devices: sharding = PositionalSharding(mesh_utils.create_device_mesh((8,))) x = JAX.random.normal(JAX.random.key(0), (8192, 8192)) y = JAX.device_put(x, sharding.reshape(4, 2)) which you can also visualize with the built in utilities: >>> JAX.debug.visualize_array_sharding(z) +---------------------+TPU 0TPU 1|----------|----------|TPU 2TPU 3|----------|----------|TPU 6TPU 7|----------|----------|TPU 4TPU 5+---------------------+ XLA’s approach is that computation follows sharding. Therefore, if the input array is sharded across some axis, XLA handles that automatically for any downstream computation. No other code changes needed. No need to add communication collections or anything. Pytorch on the other hand requires a ton of boilerplate and modifications just to get a basic DDP setup working correctly. This idea of “compiler driven development” is similar to how rust’s compiler works - helping you write better, cleaner code without worrying about a lot of mundane things. You focus on the computation, the compiler does the rest. I believe that comitting to a philosophy gives a framework a certain design skeleton and structure, that can simplify the code and create a smooth and wondeful experience for a developer. Which is why I’m unhappy with the choice made by the PyTorch devs to integrate and rely on a compiler stack for the cool new features rather than keeping the core philosophy of flexibility and freedom alive. For example, according to the official roadmap for PyTorch 2.x, they clearly outline their long-term plans of fully integrating XLA with Torch: “PyTorch/XLA is set to migrate to the open source OpenXLA as its default downstream compiler” This is an awful idea. It’s like saying that shoehorning C++ code in the rust compiler, would somehow be a better experience than using rust itself. Torch simply wasn’t designed around XLA, unlike JAX. The reason JAX’s’ ecosystem is so much more stable and well-integrated is precisely because they uphold it’s core values rather than working around them. If, god forbid, Pytorch does end up going with the plan and commits to an XLA based compiler stack, then wouldn’t the ideal framework be the one that was specifically designed and built around it, as opposed to the one where it has just been crammed in with little thought and care? And even if Pytorch ends up pursuing a ‘multi-backend’ approach, wherein you would be able choose whatever compiler backend you wish, wouldn’t that worsen the fragmentation problem and absolutely nuke the API, as it tries to respect the restrictions of every compiler stack? This isn’t just baseless theorizing either — look at Torch/XLA. Anyone who’s ever dared to use it on TPUs suffers from a PTSD so severe that they’re eligible for benefits. The mere sight of “XLA” sends them into a state of cold sweat and nightmares to the caffeine-fuelled days spent debugging hundred-line XLA errors. The only path to recovery at such moments is to reassure the victim that they’ll always have their GPUs, and an A100 may be placed beside them for emotional support. Multi-backend is doomed Pytorch’s root problem is that it tries to do everything at once and fails miserably. The “multi-backend” design decision makes this problem exponentially worse. In theory, it sounds like an amazing idea to be able to choose whichever stack you prefer - but in reality, its a tangled mess of obscure tracebacks and incompatibility issues. It’s not that its hard to get these backends working. Rather, there are some constraints that these backends expect which are hard to mesh with the flexible and pythonic API of PyTorch. There’s a tradeoff between keeping most of the API consistent vs. obeying the restrictions of the backends you leverage. As a result, the devs are seeking to rely more on codegen (say converting torch code to triton which then you can manually work with and leverage it’s compiler & JIT stack) as opposed to actually integrating/comitting to a single backend - which is arguably the worse option for torch. Every decision torch takes somehow always feels like a compromise because it refuses to make meaningful tradeoffs. There’s no coherence, no overall strategy. It ends up feeling more like a mishmash of features that don’t mesh well together and ultimately cause a lot of frustration for the user. There is no faster way to kill an ecosystem. IMHO PyTorch should not follow the JAX “integrated compiler and backend” approach for a very simple reason: Jax was explcitly designed from the ground up to work with XLA. Not against it. That is why TensorFlow never really took off, and why it’s attempts at integrating Keras crashed and burned. Your strategy simply cannot be to just replace the entire PyTorch frontend with JAX’s, because then you just have a shittier version of JAX! It’s virtually impossible to come up with a neat, functional API based on XLA that’s somehow better than JAX’s, and carries on Torch’s flexible nature. I don’t blame the devs for trying new and different ideas - those are always welcome. However, if they want PyTorch to stand the test of time, more focus has to be put in shoring up the foundations than shipping shiny new features that immediately crumble outside ideal tutorial conditions. Fragmentation & Functional Programming JAX has a “functional” API. Earlier, I mentioned that JAX functions have to be pure (i.e they cannot have any global side effect. Just like mathematical functions, given the same data the function will always return the same output no matter the context of it’s execution.) This design philosophy is what makes JAX stand out. Due to the functional roots of JAX, JAX functions are often composable and interoperate well with each other. It reduces the development complexity as functions are defined with specific signatures and a well-defined, concrete task. If the types are respected, then the function is guranteed* to work out-of-the-box. This is well suited to the kinds of workloads that one needs in scientific computing. In Deep Learning especially, since NNs are just a static functions, this functional paradigm makes writing even complex codebases easy. For example, let’s look at the optax API from the JAX ecosystem. Due to the functional approach, optax has what we call a “chain” that involves a bunch of functions sequentially applied on the gradients. So the fundamental building blocks are GradientTransformations. This makes it a really powerful but expressive API to work with. optimizer = optax.adam(1e-2) If I wanted to clip the grads here for example, I could do it trivially: optimiser = optax.chain( optax.clip_by_global_norm(1.0), optax.adam(1e-2), ) If I wanted to do a simple operation such as take the EMA of my grads, in PyTorch that would’ve required setting up objects and then manually digging through the codebases to place methods appropriately. But with optax, optimiser = optax.chain( optax.clip_by_global_norm(1.0), optax.adam(1e-2), optax.ema(decay=0.999) ) A similar approach goes for combining optimizers, meta-learning approaches, gradient accumulation etc. It’s simply much more cleaner than PyTorch. Another cool consequence of a functional design is vmap. This stands for ‘vectorized’ map which accurately describes what it does. You can map anything and as long as its a vmap, then XLA will automatically fuse and optimize it. This means that when you write functions, you don’t think about the batch dimension! You just vmap all you code and this simplifies things. For one, you need less ein-* ops. While einops are great and all - it’s simply more intuitive to grasp 2D/3D tensor manipulations, and are also much more readable IMO. Let’s take an extremely limited example operation, and compare the difference: arr: Array = jnp.ones((batch_size, seqlen, h_dim)) def vanilla_func(arr: Array) -> Array: ''' We want to do a: '(b s h, b s h) -> (b s s, b s h) -> b h s' operation. ''' return ((arr @ arr.transpose(0, 2, 1)) @ arr).transpose(0, 2, 1) @jax.vmap def vmapped_func(arr: Array) -> Array: ''' We want to do a: '(s h, s h) -> (s s, s h) -> h s' operation. ''' return ((arr @ arr.T) @ arr).T Even for this toy operation, you can immediately see how much more instantly readable the function is. Now imagine that with the more complex tensor manipulations, like the ones used in MHSA. Subscribing to the functional paradigm means that it’s easier to write complex code that works well, since you only have to reason about individual components in isolation. It’s both clean and performant because you can @jax.jit any pure function without worrying about anything else. It. Just. Works. In the functional world, as long as you respect the purity constraints and have the right signature, you enjoy all the other benefits - such as composability. With torch however, there is a non-trivial chance that whatever stack you use - say doing FSDP + multi-node + torch.compile + ... something will always break due to the sheer complexity involved. Multiple things have to work correctly together, and if any component fails due to edge case, then you would be debugging till 3 a.m. And because there would always be bugs that weren’t caught during development simply because it’s not possible to test each and every combination of the dozens of features Pytorch offers, It’s simply impossible to write code that works well without significant effort. This has meant that the torch ecosystem has become very bloated and buggy - things don’t interoperate well together, so contributors often come up with new libraries and frameworks to solve specific issues (like say HuggingFace’s accelerate for distributed training) which in turn aren’t designed to interface with other such “solutions” due to having no shared abstraction, so it quickly devolves into a mess of dependencies and requirements.txt and a training loop that looks like it was the scene of Guido Van Rossum’s murder. I’d go on to say from my anecdotal experience about 70-80% of those GitHub issues or forum discussions are simply due to various libraries erorring out on each other. Unfortunately, few solutions exist to fix it. This is very much an OOP as well as a design problem. I think having a fundamental, PyTorch~y object (like JAX’s PyTree) might’ve helped build a common base for abstraction, but I’m not an SWE so I’m not sure how much it’d have really helped. Nor can you just adopt a functional programming paradigm, at which point you’d have converged to a worse version of JAX while breaking all backwards compatibility for every existing torch codebase. The way I see it - PyTorch is well and truly fucked in this department. Reproducibility The “reproducility crisis” is an oft discussed problem in science, and AI/DL has been no exception. Despite the existence of containerized environments and version control, researchers refuse to use them and journals/conferences place no requirements on them either. Even upholding your pledge to open-source the code isn’t verified by academic institutions. However, there are some design choices that nudge users to write code that facilitates reproduction, with minimal effort. This incentivizes users to put that little effort in and gain masive advantages in return - such as being able to validate their older experiments at any point and ensure that randomness is not a factor in any their results. I believe such oversights are usually because of laziness/carelessness than malicious intent. So such small decisions can ultimately add up to saving potentially dozens of dev-hours and a lot of cussing. Seeding torch’s handling of something as simple as seeding is… not ideal. Typically, you’d have to do: import torch import numpy as np np.random.seed(0) # if you're using numpy torch.manual_seed(0) torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(args.seed) torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True) torch.utils.deterministic.fill_uninitialized_memory(True) Which let’s be honest, isn’t really the end of the world coming at barely half a dozen loc - But on the flipside, is easily forgettable/misconfigured especially in the heat of deadlines. I’ve personally known researchers who set the seeds in the wrong file at the wrong place and they weren’t even used by torch at all - instead, were just silently ignored, thus invalidating all their experiments. (That researcher was me) JAX on the other hand forces you to create an explicit key which gets passed to any function that required randomness. This approach completely eliminates this problem as the RNG at all points is statically seeded. And because jax has its own version of numpy (jax.numpy) you don’t need to remember to seed it seperately. This is a small fry - but I feel such small QoL decisions can end up making the whole framework’s UX a whole lot better. Portability One of the biggest banes of using torch codebases is the lack of portability - codebases written for running on CUDA/GPUs don’t really work well when run on non-Nvidia hardware like TPUs, NPUs, AMD GPUs etc. Worse, it’s hard to port torch code written for 1x (one) node and port it to be multi-node. Multi-node often involves dozens of dev-hours and substantial code changes to manually integrate it in the correct places. Unsurprisingly, this quickly devolves into a horror story of errors, crashes and incorrect comms that leech performance. JAX’s compiler-centric approach however gives it a win in this department. XLA handles switching between device backends for us - and it already works well out-of-the-box on GPUs/TPUs/multi-node/multi-slice with minimal to no code changes. (Support for AMD GPUs is also coming, however anecdotally it’s not in a great place right now - which seems more reflective of AMD than XLA.) One only needs to implement a device backend for XLA to use, and it automatically takes care of the intermediate steps of extracting computation from graph as specified in a framework (Jax/TF/PyTorch), produce an HLO, and then eventually emit a lower-level IR that hardware backends can then execute during runtime. Jax's hardware compatibility matrix, as of Aug 2024 This way makes it easier for hardware vendors to support their devices, as well as make the transition between devices more easier. I think this is an often overlooked, but important issue. Not everyone has access to the same hardware, so codebases that are portable across different types of hardware can be a small step towards making Deep Learning more accessible to beginners/intermediates as well as preventing a lot of frustration. Auto Scaling This point ties in with the idea of portability. Codebases that can autoscale well on their own are massively helpful during reproduction. In an ideal case, this should happen automatically with minimal code changes, unfetterd by networking boundaries. As we’ve come to expect, JAX does this well. When writing JAX code, you don’t need to specify communication primitives or do torch.distributed.barrier() everywhere - XLA automatically inserts that for us, taking the available hardware in account. This philosophy means that whatever devices JAX can detect are automatically used, irrespective of networking, topology, configuration etc. You do not need to specify ranks or a central co-ordinator host. JAX automagically synchronizes and stages all the computations for you, as well as apply optimization passes to maximize asynchronous execution of the kernels and minimize latency. All a person has to do is specify the sharding of the tensors you want to distribute across, such as sharding the batch dimension of the input arrays and due to XLA’s “computation follows sharding” approach, it automatically figures out the rest. This is due to the GSPMD partitioner in the XLA compiler stack. This is really powerful, as experiments that have been validated at scale can be run by hobbyists easily to play around with them and potentially iterate on them - and vice-versa. I feel this could help in discovery of forgotten ideas more easily, and encourage the field to be more ‘bitter’ - as ideas could be easily tested as a function at bigger scales with minimal effort, thus incentivizing such experiments. The Cons I have been disproportionately covering only the problems plaguing torch so far. But it’s not all roses with JAX either. There are a few major concerns that I wish are given far more attention among JAX/XLA devs: Governance structure Currently, XLA is under TF governance, and while talk has been made of establishing a seperate organizing body to manage all affairs, similar to torch, not much concrete efforts have been made - atleast publicly. Unfortunately, there isn’t a lot of trust in Google at the moment due to its reputation to axe unpopular products. Now, JAX is technically a DeepMind project and of core significance to Google’s entire AI push, but still I feel that having a seperate governing body would be of great long-term benefit for the ecosystem as a whole by providing guidance to the development of the project. This would give it a concrete structure, and decouple it with Google’s infamous bureaucracy - thus avoiding a whole host of problems in a single sweep. I don’t think JAX necessary needs an official structure of this sort, but rather it’d be nice to have a gurantee that JAX development will take place for a long time regardless of Google upper-management’s decisions. It would definitely help its case in adoption among companies and big labs as well, who are hesitant to spend resources incorporating tools that might stop being maintained at some point. Open source transition of XLA For the longest time, XLA was a closed-source project. However, efforts have been made to open source it, and now OpenXLA is at well outperforms the internal XLA build. However, documentation about the internals of XLA is still sparse. Most of the resources are just live talks and the occasional paper, which are often out-of-date. Having a publicly accessible roadmap of upcoming features would make it easier for people to track progress and contribute to things they find particularly interesting. I think it’d be nice to give practitioners a way to better gauge what XLA can and can’t do through Edward Yang styled mini-blogposts that breakdown each stage of the XLA compiler stack and explain the nitty-gritty details. I understand that this is resource intensive, which could be better directed elsewhere but I feel that people trust the tools more when they understand them, and there’s a positive spillover effect across the entire ecosystem that ends up benefitting everyone. Coalescing ecosystem For various reasons outside the scope of this blog, I heartily dislike flax. It’s a bane on the JAX ecosystem. It has an unintuitive API, terse syntax and is absolutely hell for beginners transitioning from PyTorch. Just use equinox. There have been attempts to fix flax’s shortcomings from the dev team, namely by using NNX which is supposed to be a more “equinox-y” wrapper ontop of flax. However, I think it’s ultimately a waste of time. If you want an equinox-styled API, then just use equinox. There isn’t a lot flax does especially better that’s hard to replicate with equinox. Plus, having little to no abstraction makes implementing things in equinox much easier and faster. Right now, a lot of the JAX ecosystem is designed around flax. equinox, because it fundamentally interfaces with PyTrees is cross-compatible with all libraries, however you do have to do a little eqx.partition-ing and filter-ing, which can be a bit annoying. I want to change the status quo. It should be the other way around - equinox should have first class support everywhere. Considering its popularity, I think this decision would objectively make thigns easier for the vast majority of serious JAX users and big codebases. I know this is a controversial opinion simply because a lot of resources have been poured into flax - But this is classic sunk-cost fallacy. equinox just does it better, in the way a JAX framework should always have been like. It may not be perfect, but its better than the alternatives by a mile. equinox vs. flax: as neatly summarized in the equinox docs. It’s good to see that maintainers of the JAX ecosystem are realizing the popularity of equinox and adjusting accordingly - however, I’d love to see a bit more love officially from Google and the flax team as well. If you want to try out JAX - it’s not even a question. Use equinox. You’ll thank me. “I’ve been using equinox for a few months now and I’ve never felt better. I have more energy. My skin is clearer. My eye sight has improved.” – Me Sharp edges Due to some of the API design decisions and XLA restrictions, JAX has some “sharp edges” that you should be careful of. The well-written documentation explains this very concisely: Common Gotchas in Jax. So go give that a read atleast once before using JAX. It’ll save you a lot of time and energy (as RTFM-ing always does). Conclusion This blogpost was to correct the often-parotted myth that PyTorch is simply the best for any real research workloads - especially on GPUs. That simply isn’t the case anymore. Infact, I’d go as far as to argue that porting all Torch code to JAX would be immensely beneficial to the field as a whole. These are not minor features - having autoparallelization, reproducibility, a clean functional API etc. would be a godsend for a lot of research codebases. So if you want to make this field a little bit better, consider rewriting your codebases in JAX. Shoutout to Patrick Kidger as well for developing equinox.

Never can be said enough how cool it is that Meta fosters and supports it. Viva PyTorch! (Jax rocks too) reply deepsquirrelnet 4 hours agoparentThis is exactly why I gravitated to it so quickly. The first time I looked at pytorch code it was immediately obvious what the abstractions meant and how to use them to write a model architecture. Jax looks like something completely different to me. Maybe I’m dumb and probably not the target audience, but it occurs to me that very few people are. When I read about using Jax, I find recommendations for a handful of other libraries that make it more useable. Which of those I choose to learn is not entirely obvious because they all seem to create a very fragmented ecosystem with code that isn’t portable. I’m still not sure why I’d spend my time learning Jax, especially when it seems like most of the complaints from the author don’t really separate out training and inference, which don’t necessarily need to occur from the same framework. reply 6gvONxR4sf7o 3 hours agorootparentHonestly, when I turn to JAX, I generally do it without a framework. It’s like asking for a framework to wrap numpy to me. Just JAX plus optax is sufficient for me in the cases I turn to it. reply PostOnce 9 hours agoparentprevTorch was originally a Lua project, hence why pytorch is called pytorch and not just torch. In another timeline AI would have made Lua popular. The best part is it trampled TensorFlow which I personally find obtuse. reply n7g 8 hours agorootparent> In another timeline AI would have made Lua popular. I wonder if it'd have been hated more than Python is - especially with the 1-based indexing... reply CuriouslyC 7 hours agorootparentPython isn't hated AFAICT, though people will profess to hating building large projects in it (myself included), but many of those people also love it for shorter programs and scripts. reply smhx 20 hours agoprevthe author got a couple of things wrong, that are worth pointing out: 1. PyTorch is going all-in on torch.compile -- Dynamo is the frontend, Inductor is the backend -- with a strong default Inductor codegen powered by OpenAI Triton (which now has CPU, NVIDIA GPU and AMD GPU backends). The author's view that PyTorch is building towards a multi-backend future isn't really where things are going. PyTorch supports extensibility of backends (including XLA), but there's disproportionate effort into the default path. torch.compile is 2 years old, XLA is 7 years old. Compilers take a few years to mature. torch.compile will get there (and we have reasonable measures that the compiler is on track to maturity). 2. PyTorch/XLA exists, mainly to drive a TPU backend for PyTorch, as Google gives no other real way to access the TPU. It's not great to try shoe-in XLA as a backend into PyTorch -- as XLA fundamentally doesn't have the flexibility that PyTorch supports by default (especially dynamic shapes). PyTorch on TPUs is unlikely to ever have the experience of JAX on TPUs, almost by definition. 3. JAX was developed at Google, not at Deepmind. reply lunaticd 4 hours agoparent3. The project started under a Harvard affiliated Github org during the course of PhDs. These same people later joined Google where it continued to be developed and over time adopted more and more in place of TensorFlow. reply n7g 8 hours agoparentprevHey, thanks for actually engaging with the blog's points instead of \"Google kills everything it touches\" :) 1. I'm well aware of the PyTorch stack, but this point: > PyTorch is building towards a multi-backend future isn't really where things are going >PyTorch supports extensibility of backends (including XLA) Is my problem. Those backends just never integrate well as I mentioned in the blogpost. I'm not sure if you've ever gone into the weeds, but there are so many (often undocumented) sharp edges when using different backends that they never really work well. For example, how bad Torch:XLA is and the nightmare inducing bugs & errors with it. > torch.compile is 2 years old, XLA is 7 years old. Compilers take a few years to mature That was one of my major points - I don't think leaning on torch.compile is the best idea. A compiler would inherently place restrictions that you have to work-around. This is not dynamic, nor flexible - and it flies in the face of torch's core philosophies just so they can offer more performance to the big labs using PyTorch. For various reasons, I dislike pandering to the rich guy instead of being an independent, open-source entity. 2. Torch/XLA is indeed primarily meant for TPUs - like the quoted announcement, where they declare to be ditching TF:XLA in favour of OpenXLA. But there's still a very real effort to get it working on GPUs - infact, a lab on twitter declared that they're using Torch/XLA on GPUs and will soon™ release details. XLA's GPU support is great, its compatible across different hardware, its optimized and mature. In short, its a great alternative to the often buggy torch.compile stack - if you fix the torch integration. So I won't be surprised if in the long-term they lean on XLA. Whether that's a good direction or not is upto the devs to decide unfortunately - not the community. 3. Thank you for pointing that out. I'm not sure about the history of JAX (maybe might make for a good blogpost for JAX devs to write someday), but it seems that it was indeed developed at Google research, though also heavily supported + maintained by DeepMind. Appreciate you giving the time to comment here though :) reply wafngar 11 hours agoprevPyTorch is developed by multiple companies / stake holders while jax is google only with internal tooling they don’t share with the world. This alone is a major reason not to use jax. Also I think it is more the other way around: with torch.compile the main advantage of jax is disappearing. reply dauertewigkeit 10 hours agoparentIt's the old age question in programming: Do you use a highly constrained paradigm that allows easy automatic optimization or do you use a very flexible and more user intuitive paradigm that makes automatic optimization harder? If the future is going to be better more intelligent compilers, then that settles the question in my opinion. reply n7g 8 hours agoparentprev> with torch.compile the main advantage of jax is disappearing. Interesting take - I agree here somewhat. But also, wouldn't you think a framework that has been from the ground-up designed around a specific, mature compiler stack be better able to integrate compilers in a more stable fashion than just shoe-horning static compilers into a very dynamic framework? ;) reply anon389r58r58 25 minutes agorootparentSo the answer is not Jax? Because JAX is not designed around a mature compiler stack. The history of Jax is more so that it matured alongside the compiler... reply wafngar 48 minutes agorootparentprevDepends. PyTorch on the other hand has a large user base and well defined and tested api. So should be doable; and is already progressing and rapid speed.. reply ianbutler 3 hours agoprevFrom an eng/industry perspective, back in 2016/2017 I watched the realtime decline of Tensorflow towards Pytorch. The issue was TF had too many interfaces to accomplish the same thing and each one was rough in its own way. Along with some complexity for using serving and experiment logging via Tensorboard, but this wasn’t as bad at least for me. Keras was integrated in an attempt to help, but ultimately it wasn’t enough and people started using Torch more and more even against the perception that TF was for prod workloads and Torch was for research. TFA mentions the interface complexity as starting to be a problem with Torch, but I don’t think we’re anywhere near the critical point that would cause people to abandon it in favor of JAX. Additionally with JAX you’re just shoving the portability problems mentioned down to XLA which brings its own issues and gotchas even if it hides the immediate reality of said problems from the end user. I think the Torch maintainers should watch not to repeat the mistakes of TF, but I think theres a long way to go before JAX is a serious contender. It’s been years and JAX has stayed in relatively small usage. reply markeroon 2 hours agoparentImo the biggest issue (from memory) was that Tensorflow used a static computation graph. PyTorch was so much easier to work with. reply ianbutler 2 hours agorootparentYup that was also definitely one among the many issues reply 6gvONxR4sf7o 1 hour agoprevOne aspect of jax that’s rarely touched on is browser stuff. Completely aside from deep learning, it’s straightforward to compile jax to a graphics shader you can call in js, which in this insane world is actually my preferred way to put numerical computing or linear algebra code on a web page. reply 0x19241217 6 hours agoprevPushback notwithstanding, this article is 100% correct in all PyTorch criticisms. PyTorch was a platform for fast experimentation with eager evaluation, now they shoehorn \"compilers\" into it. \"compilers\", because a lot of the work is done by g++ and Triton. It is a messy and quickly expanding codebase with many surprises like segfaults and leaks. Is scientific experimentation really sped up by these frameworks? Everyone uses the Transformer model and uses the same algorithms over and over again. If researchers wrote directly in C or Fortran, perhaps they'd get new ideas. The core inference (see Karparthy's llama.c) is ridiculously small. Core training does not seem much larger either. reply sundarurfriend 2 hours agoprevCan we get the title changed to the actual title of the post? \"The future of Deep Learning frameworks\" sounds like a neutral and far wider-reaching article, and ends up being clickbait here (even if unintentionally). \"PyTorch is dead. Long live JAX.\" conveys exactly what the article about, and is a much better title. reply patrickkidger 11 hours agoprevI think a lot of the commenters here are being rather unfair. PyTorch has better adoption / network effects. JAX has stronger underlying abstractions. I use both. I like both :) reply n7g 8 hours agoparentHey patrick, love your work! I think the biggest, well \"con\" I've seen is non-technical - the fear of JAX being killed by Google. I mention in the blog as well [here](https://neel04.github.io/my-website/blog/pytorch_rant/#gover...) how important having an independent governance structure is. I'm sure for many big companies and labs, the lack of a promise of long-term, stable support is a huge dealbreaker. I'm not sure how much Google bureaucracy would limit this, but have you raised the subject of forming an independent entity to govern JAX, very much like PyTorch? I believe XLA is protected, as its with TF governance. But perhaps, there could be one for JAX's ecosystem as well, encompassing optax, equinox, flax etc. reply Eridrus 4 hours agorootparentI can personally say, I am not super concerned about it being killed. Google supported TF1 for quite a long time and all these projects have a shelf life. What concerned me about JAX, at a small company, is that it doesn't benefit from the network effects of almost everyone developing for it. E.g. There is no Llama 3.1 implementation in JAX afaict. So as long as there is a need to pull from the rest of the world the ecosystem will trump the framework. Activity in the LLM space is slowing down though, so there is an opportunity to take the small set of what worked and port it to JAX and show people how good that world is. reply wafngar 7 hours agoparentprevProbably unfair as a reaction to the unfair statements in the blog… reply funks_ 21 hours agoprevI wish dex-lang [1] had gotten more traction. It’s JAX without the limitations that come from being a Python DSL. But ML researchers apparently don’t want to touch anything that doesn’t look exactly like Python. [1]: https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang reply cherryteastain 19 hours agoparentIt's very rare that an ML project is _only_ the ML parts. A significant chunk of the engineering effort goes into data pipelines and other plumbing. Having access to a widely used general purpose language with plenty of libraries in addition to all the ML libraries is the real reason why everyone goes for Python for ML. reply hatmatrix 20 hours agoparentprevIt seems like an experimental research language. Julia also competes in this domain from a more practical standpoint and has less limitations than JAX as I understand it, but is less mature and still working on getting wider traction. reply funks_ 20 hours agorootparentThe Julia AD ecosystem is very interesting in that the community is trying to make the entire language differentiable, which is much broader in scope than what Torch and JAX are doing. But unlike Dex, Julia is not a language built from the ground up for automatic differentiation. Shameless plug for one of my talks at JuliaCon 2024: https://www.youtube.com/live/ZKt0tiG5ajw?t=19747s. The comparison between Python and Julia starts at 5:31:44. reply hatmatrix 19 hours agorootparentAh I had not realized I was corresponding with the author of that talk - I'd followed it back when it was happening as I'm particularly interested in adapting AD. Where do you feel Julia is at this point in time (compared to say, JAX or PyTorch) from a practitioner's standpoint? reply mccoyb 20 hours agoparentprevDex is also missing user authored composable program transformations, which is one of JAX’s hidden superpowers. So not quite “JAX without limitations” — but certainly without some of the limitations. reply 6gvONxR4sf7o 3 hours agorootparentThis is both its strength and its weakness. As soon as you write a jaxpr interpreter, you lose all the tooling that makes the python interpreter so mature. For example stack traces and debugging become black holes. If jax made it easy to write these transformations without losing python’s benefits it would be incredible. reply funks_ 20 hours agorootparentprevAre you talking about custom VJPs/JVPs? reply mccoyb 20 hours agorootparentNo, I'm talking about custom `Jaxpr` interpreters which can modify programs to do things. reply hedgehog 20 hours agoparentprevIt's not about the syntax, it's all the knowledge, tools, existing code, etc that make Python so attractive. reply funks_ 19 hours agorootparentI don't doubt that, but I'm specifically talking about new languages. I've seen far more enthusiasm from ML researchers for Mojo, which doesn't even do automatic differentiation, than for Dex. And to recycle an old HN comment of mine, people are much more eager to learn a functional programming language if it looks like NumPy (I'm talking about JAX here). reply hedgehog 1 hour agorootparentIs Mojo actually getting significant uptake in research? I haven't been following closely but new tooling at that layer seems much more useful when cost-optimizing deployment. reply FL33TW00D 4 hours agoprevAre modern NN's really just static functions, and are they going to continue to be in the future? KV caching is directly in conflict with a purely functional approach. reply spott 1 hour agoparentIs it? The same inputs have the same outputs, the only thing different is the performance. It is basically the same as memorization. reply visarga 2 hours agoparentprevYou could sen the KV cache and even the LoRA as input args to a static model. reply deisteve 21 hours agoprevi like pytorch because all the academia release their code with it ive never even heard of jax nor will i have the skills to use it i literally just want to know two things: 1) how much vram 2) how to run it on pytorch reply sva_ 21 hours agoparentJax is a competing computational framework that does something similar to PyTorch, so both of your questions don't really make sense. reply etiam 20 hours agorootparentMaybe deisteve will answer for himself, but I don't think that's meant to mean how to run Jax on Pytorch, but rather the questions he's interested in for any published model. reply deisteve 18 hours agorootparentif a paper releases code in PyTorch im not going to sit there and complain Jax is more efficient its like fretting about how everything should be written in C++ instead of Python/Javascript I don't care. reply deisteve 18 hours agorootparentprevcan i run pytorch code on jax? if not im not interested. i'll keep using pytorch. i hope this answer makes more sense for you. reply semiinfinitely 22 hours agoprevPyTorch is the javascript of ML. sadly \"worse is better\" software has better survival characteristics even when there is consensus that technology X is theoretically better reply sva_ 21 hours agoparentI don't think the comparison is fair. Imo PyTorch has the cleanest abstractions, which is the reason it is so popular. People can do quick prototyping without having to spend too much time figuring out the engineering details that make their hardware run it. reply pineapple_sauce 11 hours agoparentprevHow is Jax theoretically better than PyTorch? The author is ignorant of torch.compile and biased as other commenters have pointed out. reply n7g 9 hours agorootparentCurious to know how the OP is biased when they have no conflict of interest, and they explicitly mention the `torch.compile` stack like... a few dozen times in the blog? reply bob020202 21 hours agoparentprevNothing is even theoretically better than Javascript for its intended use cases, web frontends and backends. Mainly because it went all-in on event loop parallelism early-on, which isn't just for usability but also performance. And didn't go all-in on OOP unlike Java, and has easy imports/packages unlike Python. It has some quirks like the \"0 trinity,\" but that doesn't really matter. No matter how good you are with something else, it still takes more dev time ($$$) than JS. Now it's been forever since I used PyTorch or TF, but I only remember TF 1.x being more like \"why TF isn't this working.\" At some point I didn't blame myself, I blamed the tooling, which TF2 later admitted. It seemed like no matter how skilled I got with TF1, it'd always take much longer than developing with PyTorch, so I switched early. reply josephg 21 hours agorootparentYou don't think its possible to (even theoretically) improve on javascript for its intended use case? What a terrific lack of imagination. Typescript and Elm would like a word reply bob020202 21 hours agorootparentNo, I said there's nothing that exists right now that's theoretically better. Typescript isn't. It'd be great if TS's type inference were smart enough that it basically takes no additional dev input vs JS, but until then, it's expensive to use. It's also bolted on awkwardly, but that's changing soon. Could also imagine JS getting some nice Py features like list comp. Also, generally when people complain that JS won the web, it's not because they prefer TS, it's cause they wanted to use something else and can't. Never used Elm, but... no variables, kinda like Erlang, which I've used. That has its appeal, but you're not going to find a consensus that this is better for web. reply dwattttt 20 hours agorootparentI see this a lot, and I want to find the right words for it: I don't want the types automatically determined for what I write, because I write mistakes. I want to write the type, and for that to reveal the mistake. reply bob020202 20 hours agorootparentIf you explicitly mark types at lower levels, or just use typed libs, it's not very easy to pass the wrong type somewhere and have it still accidentally work. The most automatic type inference I can think of today is in Rust, which is all about safety, or maybe C++ templates count too. reply dwattttt 18 hours agorootparentI actually write a fair bit of Rust, and there I'll still explicitly add types. Not always (in particular where I have an IDE that'll show me the inferred type & it's trivial), but in particular if any more complicated inference is happening I'll constrain it. reply kaoD 11 hours agorootparentprevTS has type inference on function return types while Rust forces you to type the whole function signature (for a good reason, TS's return type inference is a footgun). Other than that, I haven't noticed their inference capabilities being any different. So I don't get your point. Can you give a single example where Rust has more automatic type inference compared with TS? (honest question, maybe I'm missing something) reply josephg 19 hours agorootparentprev> No, I said there's nothing that exists right now that's theoretically better. That might be what you meant, but its not what you said. Thanks for clarifying. reply logicchains 21 hours agoprevPyTorch beat Tensorflow because it was much easier to use for research. Jax is much harder to use for exploratory research than PyTorch, due to requiring a fixed shape computation graph, which makes implementing many custom model architectures very difficult. Jax's advantages shine when it comes to parallelizing a new architecture across multiple GPU/TPUs, which it makes much easier than PyTorch (no need for custom cuda/networking code). Needing to scale up a new architecture across many GPUs is however not a common use-case, and most teams that have the resources for large-scale multi-gpu training also have the resources for specialised engineers to do it in PyTorch. reply big-chungus4 9 hours agoparentDoesn't JAX support dynamic graphs as well? reply logicchains 3 hours agorootparentNope, changing graph shape requires recompilation: https://github.com/google/jax/discussions/17191 reply auggierose 9 hours agoprevSo if multi-backend is doomed, is tinygrad then doomed, too? reply n7g 6 hours agoparentI haven't used TinyGrad but I'm not really sure what its goal is. To be the best autograd framework? to be a minimal one? I'm glad they've removed the (rather arbitrary, and admittedly stupid) loc cap. And from the little I know, geohot is focusing on having its own internal compiler stack. As much as I admire geohot, I don't think rolling your own compiler is the best way. Its not that the TinyGrad team isn't smart enough, but a compiler is a huge undertaking and that you have to support and maintain for a long time. I'm sure he's well aware of this, but no big labs would touch TG seriously because of this limitation. XLA on the other hand is under governance seperate from Google, and is far more mature - so people trust that. That said, I don't know much about Tinygrad so I would appreciate if someone more knowledgable can jump in here and outline the differences and key features ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ reply pjmlp 11 hours agoprevThe best thing about PyTorch is that we aren't stuck with Python, rather we can enjoy it alongside proper performance, by using the Java and C++ API surfaces instead. reply ein0p 21 hours agoprevJax is dead, long live PyTorch. PyTorch has _twenty times_ as many users as Jax. Any rumors of its death are highly exaggerated reply tripplyons 20 hours agoparentIt's definitely exaggerated, but I personally prefer JAX and have found it easier to use than PyTorch for almost everything. If you haven't already, I would give JAX a good try. reply melling 21 hours agoparentprevThey used to say the same thing about Perl and Python Downvoted. Hmmm. I’m a little tired so I don’t want to go into detail. However, I was a Perl programmer when Python was rising. So, needless to say, having a big lead doesn’t matter. Please learn from history. A big lead means nothing. reply ein0p 20 hours agorootparentIt’s been years and Jax is just where it was, no growth whatsoever. And that’s with all of Google forced internally to use only Jax. Look, I like the technical side of Jax for the most part, but it’s years too late to the party and it’s harder to use than PyTorch. It just isn’t going to ever take off at this point. reply deisteve 21 hours agoparentprevlot of contrarian takes are popular but rarely implemented in reality reply hprotagonist 21 hours agoprev> I believe that all infrastructure built on Torch is just a huge pile of technical debt, that will haunt the field for a long, long time. ... from the company that pioneered the approach with tensorflow.

You can make run this title when Jax's adoption surpasses PyTorch. How does someone using _python_ not understand this? reply sva_ 20 hours agoprev> I’ve personally known researchers who set the seeds in the wrong file at the wrong place and they weren’t even used by torch at all - instead, were just silently ignored, thus invalidating all their experiments. (That researcher was me) Some assert-ing won't hurt you. Seriously. It might even help keeping your sanity. reply cs702 20 hours agoprevA more accurate title for the OP would be \"I hope and wish PyTorch were dead, so Jax could become the standard.\" Leaving aside the fact that PyTorch's ecosystem is 10x to 100x larger, depending on how one measures it, PyTorch's biggest advantage, in my experience, is that it can be picked up quickly by developers who are new to it. Jax, despite its superiority, or maybe because of it, can not be picked up quickly. Equinox does a great job of making Jax accessible, but Jax's functional approach is in practice more difficult to learn than PyTorch's object-oriented one. reply munchler 22 hours agoprevnext [4 more] This is such a hyperbolic headline it's hard to be interested in reading the actual article. reply dang 12 hours agoparentWe've unhyperbolized it via the subtitle. reply sundarurfriend 1 hour agorootparentI think that change was for the worse.

    "originBody": "Announcing Team Atlanta! Taesoo Kim Announcement August 13, 2024 Hello, world! We are Team Atlanta, the minds behind Atlantis, our innovative AI-driven cybersecurity solution competing in the prestigious DARPA AIxCC . Our team is a collaborative powerhouse made up of six leading institutions: Georgia Tech , GTRI , Samsung Research , Samsung Research America , KAIST , and POSTECH . Each of these organizations is led by Georgia Tech alumni, and includes past winners of prestigious hacking competitions such as DEF CON CTF, Pwn2Own and kernelCTF. For the past several months, we have been diligently preparing for this competition, combining our expertise in AI, cybersecurity, and software engineering. Last week, we proudly competed in the AIxCC Semifinals, showcasing our hard work and dedication to advancing cybersecurity through artificial intelligence. The Journey Begins When AIxCC was announced last year , we quickly assembled a team of friends, including Zellic and SSLab . At that time, much was uncertain; details about the game format, scoring rubric, proof-of-vulnerability (PoV), sanitizers, harnesses, supported programming languages, and proof-of-understanding (PoU) were all unclear. Our team, however, started preparing for the competition from last October. Many of our team members previously participated in the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) as part of Crspy , where we were responsible for bug finding and exploitation generation. DARPA CGC was an ambitious endeavor that sparked numerous innovative research directions afterward. However, the competition was not without its challenges, particularly due to the gamification of the event; the scoring metrics and rules significantly influenced the outcomes . In the end, the competing Cyber Reasoning Systems (CRS) that focused on operating reactively–prioritizing the availability score over fixing bugs– tended to score higher, as exploitation proved to be far more difficult than patching. Aware of the gamification issues from CGC, we anticipated that to excel in AIxCC our CRS should leverage AI, particularly LLMs, aggressively in various depths and levels of the CRS pipelines. With this in mind, we strategically chose to focus our efforts on two key directions: Static Analysis. To encourage the use of LLMs and set AIxCC apart from CGC, we anticipated that AIxCC would strongly advocate for the adoption of static analysis while steering away from the dominant use of fuzzing1. It’s important to note that finding bugs is quite different from finding crash- or bug-triggering inputs. The latter offers a clear advantage in objectively and autonomously verifying the discovered bug, but it has a much narrower scope compared to the former. In practice, the triggering aspect, also known as the reachability problem, is a significantly more challenging and crucial issue to address, where dynamic tools like fuzzing have a clear edge. Fine-tuning LLMs for Source Code. Specialization is always an advantage when possible. Given that each CRS will likely need to support more than 10 programming languages during the competition, we decided to fine-tune both in-house and open-source models for analyzing code. This approach is conceptually similar to commitPack , but focuses on commits related to bugs like their fixes, bug-introducing commits, descriptions, and public exploits, if available. Our expectation was that training with this data would enable the fine-tuned LLM to reason about security bugs, their fixes, and likely input corpus, more effectively than the foundational model. We quickly realized that to pursue these directions effectively, we first needed a dataset: a benchmark. Our team divided tasks into three areas: 1) static analysis using LLM prompts/agents, 2) developing a C benchmark from sources like CGC and OSS-Fuzz, and 3) collecting a training dataset pairing CVEs with patches and PoCs for open-source projects to fine-tune our in-house code model at Samsung or to leverage open-source LLMs. Remarkably, within 4-5 months, we accomplished all three goals, and our LLM-based Cyber Reasoning System (CRS), dubbed Skynet, performed surprisingly well on our benchmark, and fine-tuning on a smaller dataset shows some promises like in python. Time flew by. The cold winter of 2023 ended, and we found ourselves in the new year of 2024. I vividly remember that around this time, our dear friends from Zellic left our team to pursue the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) track, which DARPA supports with $1 million for the competition. Unfortunately, Georgia Tech and Samsung were not eligible for this award. Kick-off with Surprises! At the kick-off event on March 29th, AIxCC unveiled the first challenge project: the Linux kernel, along with an example vulnerability, CVE-2021-43267 . This bug is well documented , and its PoC exploit is publicly available , making it an excellent example to work on. What makes this bug even more intriguing is the story behind it. A security researcher audited the Linux kernel source code using CodeQL . Specifically, the researcher was searching for instances where 16-bit size parameters are passed to the kmalloc() function for memory allocation, using a dataflow-based CodeQL query. The intuition was that a 16-bit size parameter could easily lead to an integer overflow when accessing the allocated object. However, the discovered bug was not caused by an integer overflow, but an out-of-bound heap overflow due to a missing sanity check on the size and related inputs. static bool tipc_crypto_key_rcv(struct tipc_crypto *rx, struct tipc_msg *hdr) {struct tipc_crypto *tx = tipc_net(rx->net)->crypto_tx;struct tipc_aead_key *skey = NULL;u16 key_gen = msg_key_gen(hdr);u16 size = msg_data_sz(hdr);u8 *data = msg_data(hdr); .../* Allocate memory for the key */skey = kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC);if (unlikely(!skey)) { pr_err(\"%s: unable to allocate memory for skey\", rx->name); goto exit;}/* Copy key from msg data */skey->keylen = ntohl(*((__be32 *)(data + TIPC_AEAD_ALG_NAME)));memcpy(skey->alg_name, data, TIPC_AEAD_ALG_NAME);memcpy(skey->key, data + TIPC_AEAD_ALG_NAME + sizeof(__be32), skey->keylen); The skey was allocated with a size based on the user-provided hdr, but skey->key was copied up to skey->keylen, which was also user-controlled and could therefore be inconsistent with size. Unfortunately, the kernel did not perform a sanity check on these two parameters, causing an out-of-boundary access. commit fa40d9734a57bcbfa79a280189799f76c88f7bb0 Author: Max VADate: Mon Oct 25 17:31:53 2021 +0200 tipc: fix size validations for the MSG_CRYPTO type The function tipc_crypto_key_rcv is used to parse MSG_CRYPTO messages to receive keys from other nodes in the cluster in order to decrypt any further messages from them.

Misunderstanding 1: PoV Given a massive Linux repository (yes, 20 million lines of code), where should we start? The LLM approach is all about asking the right questions, also known as prompt engineering. We utilized various techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and were exploring Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to quickly identify known 1-day bugs. At that time, context size was limited; the most advanced model, gpt-3.5 turbo (yes, pre-gpt-4 era) from OpenAI, supported 16k tokens, making it crucial to ask the right question! We initially tried identifying potentially vulnerable code snippets using a range of static analysis tools, including CodeQL, Semgrep and various tools from academic publications, and then filtered the results with LLMs. We even considered diffing the upstream Linux kernel against the provided repository, so that our CRS can look at the modified part of the code first. We were confident our decision; to promote the use of AI tools, the AIxCC organizers would design the competition in a way that allows a single CRS codebase to explore any code repository using 10+ programming languages and their combinations. Ah, around that time, Google had just announced gemini-pro with an impressive 128k context and the potential to support 1 million tokens! Meanwhile, gpt-4 introduced a game-changing feature called function calling, which allows the LLM to select which callback to use and integrate the results back into the prompt at runtime. We felt that everything was evolving favorably for our CRS to adopt these cutting-edge techniques. However, PoV turned out to mean bug-triggering input or a crashing input. To demonstrate the existence of a bug, each CRS needed to formulate an input that the referee could quickly verify. While this approach is straightforward and objective for the competition, it significantly discourages the adoption of LLMs in finding bugs. Our team quickly realized that we needed to pivot to the dynamic approaches like fuzzing for the competition. void tipc_trigger(uint8_t *smashbuf, uint32_t smashlen, int seqno) { uint8_t pkt[0x1000]; uint32_t w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5; w0 = hdr_version(TIPC_VERSION); w0 |= hdr_size(6); w0 |= hdr_user(MSG_CRYPTO); w0 |= hdr_msg_size(24 + 36 + KEY_SIZE); w1 = 0; w2 = seqno; w3 = NODE_ID; w4 = 0; w5 = 0; memset(pkt, 0, sizeof(pkt)); gen_tipc_hdr(pkt, w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5); memcpy(pkt+24, \"HAXX\", 4); *(uint32_t*)(pkt+24+32) = be32(KEY_SIZE + SMASH_SIZE + smashlen); // <- (1) memset(pkt+24+36, 'C', KEY_SIZE); memset(pkt+24+36+KEY_SIZE, 'D', SMASH_SIZE); memcpy(pkt+24+36+KEY_SIZE + SMASH_SIZE, smashbuf, smashlen); tipc_send(pkt, sizeof(pkt)); } Formulating a bug-triggering input, including ensuring its reachability, is a far more challenging task than simply spotting buggy code in the repository. The strength of fuzzing, perhaps the opposite of a sophisticated LLM, is that once a bug is found, you almost always have a bug-triggering input. In CVE-2021-43267, using CodeQL and auditing, one could identify this bug, but triggering it is an entirely different challenge, not to mention exploiting it . For example, TIPC must be properly set up first, and the keylen needs to be precisely crafted in (1) to trigger the bug. Misunderstanding 2. Harnesses Sorry, what’s the input needed to trigger CVE-2021-43267? even with a fuzzer? To fuzz the Linux kernel, we needed a user program that calls a sequence of system calls with various arguments. Considering the Linux kernel has over 400 system calls to explore, this was far from ideal for a competition setting. We initially assumed that harnesses and test cases would be provided to indicate which parts of the Linux kernel should be checked for bugs. To tackle this, we implemented and adopted various versions of Linux kernel fuzzers, including a custom kernel syscall fuzzer with kcov and kcmp, and also utilized the most popular Linux fuzzer, Syzkaller . However, our focus remained on determining which sequences of system calls to test, using syscall traces and static analysis of the provided program, and then correctly formulating an end-to-end userspace program to trigger the bug. /*** * Blob begins with a 4 byte command count * [4-bytes command count] * Currently there are two commands: * 0 - send a packet blob * [4-bytes size][4-bytes send flags][size-bytes packet data] * 1 - send a netlink packet * [4-bytes Message Type][4-bytes Message Flags][4-bytes Netlink Protocol][4-bytes size][size bytes data] * blob_size MUST be a trusted value */ int harness( uint8_t *blob, uint32_t blob_size) { ... } The Linux Kernel CP was announced in April and came with a harness, linux_test_harness.c . This announcement was full of surprises; the program’s structure was provided by the harness, which is alas what we primarily focused on, and the blob needed to be fed to the harness in a way that triggers the bug. The types of system calls we could interact with were limited by the harness, and our task was to find the right data input that would lead the harness to invoke the necessary sequence of system calls with the correct parameters. In other words, we needed to understand the harness first before dealing with the Linux kernel bugs. Later, the Jenkins harness was announced, and more surprisingly, it was a fuzz driver (often called a fuzzing harness), a standalone program designed to invoke APIs for fuzz testing. In May, a new CP, called mock-cp (a userspace program), was introduced along with a new harness format, which was simply a shell script executing a CP binary with the provided input. Such diverse formats got us thinking that our CRS should adopt LLM to figure out the structure of the programs and CPs first; like how to compile, how to correctly run, etc. By June, the harness format was officially established - surprisingly, yet not entirely unexpected: libfuzzer for userspace programs (mock-cp and Nginx), jazzer for Java programs (Jenkins), while retaining the blob-based harness for the Linux kernel. We continually updated our CRS to adapt to these changes, but many of these decisions rendered our LLM-based components unnecessary. This decision, however, greatly helped all the participating teams by reducing the engineering time needed for game operation. Unfortunately, we were too proactive in reacting to these changes and ended up wasting some engineering time as a result 😊. A harness’s role is crucial in the AIxCC competition; it sets the context for the CRS to trigger the bug and serves as a key factor in adjusting the difficulty of bug discovery. Therefore, it’s important to strike a balance: it should provide enough detail to relieve the CRS from unnecessary burdens, allowing it to focus on bug finding, but without revealing too much information about the bugs. Misunderstanding 3. Proof-of-understanding Unlike CGC, which treated the PoV (a proof-of-concept exploit) as sufficient proof of bug discovery, AIxCC required additional information—specifically, the bug type as classified by CWE , to be provided along with the PoV. This was an interesting decision, as AIxCC required CRS to find bugs in the source code, whereas CGC focused on discovering bugs in binaries. Our team spent a lot of time brainstorming how to accurately identify CWE categories, primarily by using LLM prompts that leverage crashing inputs, sanitizer reports, related code snippets, outputs from static analyzers, and more. However, the notion of CWEs can be ambiguous when used as a scoring mechanism for the competition. For instance, should CVE-2021-43267 be classified as (1) CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), (2) CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), or (3) CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)? The first two describe the symptoms caused by the bug, while the third identifies the root cause, as the patch for this bug involved adding input validations. In the end, AIxCC shifted the focus from PoV to identifying the bug-introducing commit (BIC) - the specific hash or commit ID in the git repository. Combined with the fuzzing harness and PoV, the CRS’s task was to run the fuzzing harness and perform a git-bisect to pinpoint the BIC in the repository. We did a simple bisecting in the semifinal but lots of improvement required to be functional for the final event. Misunderstanding 4. Semantic patching Patching is one of the most intriguing aspects of AIxCC. In CGC, the PoV was typically a simple exploit (like arbitrary read/write/execute), so mitigation strategies (e.g., adding a stack canary) could effectively thwart the PoV. In fact, patches could be applied without even knowing the specific bug; for example, adding a stack canary to all functions in a binary can prevent buffer overflow exploits that might exist in some places. The challenge in CGC was that the focus was on the binary, and the organizers introduced rules such as a minimum number of bytes changed and performance overheads added to the scoring rubric (e.g., instrumenting all memory accesses to prevent out-of-bound errors). These rules were designed to encourage competitors to generate correct patches. Ultimately, this forced CRS to weigh the pros and cons of universal patching, as both exploiting and patching were extremely difficult during the CGC era, resulting in a trade-off between losing points from exploitation versus losing points from patching and availability. In AIxCC, the CRS must generate a semantically correct patch that not only fixes the identified PoV but also maintains the functional correctness of the CP. This is a tricky task, as correctness cannot be formally defined for CRS - some functional changes may be acceptable, while others may not, depending on the code owner’s criteria. One approach to addressing this ambiguity is to provide test code to see if the patch passes the provided, so-called public tests. However, CRS must still account for private tests set by the organizers. In the semifinals, our CRS submitted a patch that successfully prevented the crash and passed the public tests given to us during the competition, but was ultimately rejected in the private functionality tests. We’re eager to learn more about the bug and the patch! Misunderstanding 5: Sanitizers The concept of sanitizers was unclear to our team until we encountered their concrete implementation for memory-safe languages like Java, and more specifically, for Jenkins, a web application written in Java! The role of a sanitizer, essentially a bug oracle, is to determine whether a bug has been correctly triggered. In memory-unsafe languages like C, standard tools like ASAN and UBSAN can serve as sanitizers to catch memory-safety issues with low or no false positives (e.g., out-of-bound accesses should never occur). However, in memory-safe languages, things get trickier. For example, is executing a command a legitimate feature in CI tools like Jenkins, or should it be treated as a command injection (CWE-78)? In other words, sanitizers are more CP-specific rather than programming language-specific; each CP needs to provide custom sanitizers (e.g., path traversal sanitizers ). Our team initially spent time working on finding web-related bugs like XSS or CSRF in Jenkins - areas where we believed LLMs could excel in seed generation. However, once AIxCC announced that the sanitizers for Java would be jazzer sanitizers, we decided to shift our focus more towards standard jazzer-based fuzzing. Semifinal Our team dedicated most of our engineering effort to building a CRS for the Linux Kernel, and we’re proud that our CRS was able to find and correctly generate a patch for CVE-2021-43267 in the end. However, during the semifinal, it appeared that only one harness was provided, similar to the exemplar, and none of the CRSes functioned properly for the Linux Kernel. We loved to know more about how our Linux CRS functioned during the competition. In summary, our CRS earned a total of six achievement badges: five for discovering bugs (i.e., first bloods) and one for a patch. Our CRS found several unique bugs, which we will describe in a later blog post! Aside from the known CPs—Linux (C), Jenkins (Java), and Nginx (C) - there were new CPs introduced, namely Tika (Java) and sqlite3 (C). Our CRS performed relatively well on sqlite3, but unfortunately, our Java CRS struggled with Tika. We would love to learn more about what happened during the competition. Tika, a popular file format parser, has many unique features, such as recursively parsing embedded objects, which may have contributed to the challenges we faced. Looking Ahead to the AIxCC Final 🎉 AIxCC Finalists We are thrilled that our team has advanced to the AIxCC finals! We have several ideas that could make the competition even more exciting: Different execution times based on code complexity. The Linux kernel, with its 6,000 files and 20 million lines of code, requires substantial time for bookkeeping like building, bootstrapping, and bisecting. Compared to smaller programs (e.g., 200k in Tika), it would be beneficial to allocate more time for CRSes to navigate such complex codebases. More programming languages and their combinations. Top candidates include Python, Rust, and JavaScript/HTML, along with combinations like JNI (C) in Java or Rust device drivers in the Linux kernel. These would offer a more comprehensive evaluation of CRS capabilities in diverse and challenging settings where CRS is most needed. Standardized execution environments. Standardizing the compiler (e.g., clang-18), runtime (e.g., JVM version), and base Docker image ahead of time would help teams explore more advanced techniques, such as LLM-based instrumentation, in a controlled environment. Improved visualization during the competition. While the AIxCC village was impressively set up, competing teams and participants had limited visibility into the competition’s progress and how each CRS was functioning. To capture more attention from the DEF CON audience , it would be beneficial to expose more technical information during the competition - such as showing current prompts of each CRS in turn, their CPU usage, or even stdout from CRSes (for fun), along with explanations of the progress. With our baseline system up and running, it’s time for our team to explore the possibility of incorporating LLMs or ML techniques into our CRS workflow. If you’re passionate about AIxCC and as committed to the competition as we are, feel free to contact us ! We are fortunate to have support from generous sponsors like GT/GTRI, Samsung, and KAIST/NYU. If your company is interested in sponsoring our team, we would be happy to discuss further! Last but not least, we want to extend our heartfelt thanks to the AIxCC organizers for launching the competition we’ve been craving. Hackers thrive on competition-driven innovation, and this has been an exciting opportunity for all of us. I think it’s one of the worst names ever chosen by a security researcher; non-security folks often think it’s a really dumb technique. But if you dig into the details, it’s actually an impressive AI tool. It operates entirely autonomously, adapting to unknown code, self-learning from past executions, using feedback loops similar to backpropagation, and employing cost functions like coverage maps, and more! Most importantly, like deep learning, it works incredibly well in practice! ↩︎ Tags : Team Share :",

Regarding CTFs, I have some experience. I'm a member of the Tea Deliverers CTF team, and I participated in the DARPA CGC CTF back in 2016 with team b1o0p. There are a few issues that make it challenging to directly apply our AIxCC approaches to CTF challenges: 1. *Format Compatibility:* This year’s DEFCON CTF finals didn’t follow a uniform format. The challenges were complex and involved formats like a Lua VM running on a custom Verilog simulator. Our system, however, is designed for source code repositories like Git repos. 2. *Binary vs. Source Code:* CTFs are heavily binary-oriented, whereas AIxCC is focused on source code. In CTFs, reverse engineering binaries is often required, but our system isn’t equipped to handle that yet. We are, however, interested in supporting binary analysis in the future! reply doctorpangloss 20 hours agoparentprevEveryone thinks bug bounties should be higher. How high should they be? Who should pay for them? reply hqzhao 20 hours agorootparentIt really depends on the target and the quality of the vulnerability. For example, low-quality software on GitHub might not warrant high bug bounties, and that's understandable. However, critical components like KVM, ESXi, WebKit, etc., need to be taken much more seriously. For vendor-specific software, the responsibility to pay should fall on the vendor. When it comes to open-source software, a foundation funded by the vendors who rely on it for core productivity would be ideal. For high-quality vulnerabilities, especially those that can demonstrate exploitability without any prerequisites (e.g., zero-click remote jailbreaks), the bounties should be on par with those offered at competitions like Pwn2Own. :) reply doctorpangloss 18 hours agorootparentIt seems really hard for people to like, name some vulnerabilities, name some prices. I'm glad you are playing along. Which scenario makes more sense: The Punchline: Microsoft pays $10m for vulnerabilities like the kind used to exploit SolarWinds and the Azure token audience vulnerability. The Status Quo: Thousands of people pay CrowdStrike a total of billions of dollars, in exchange for urgent patching when vulnerabilities become known. Okay, do you see what I am getting at? On the one hand, if you pay bug bounties, the bugs get fixed, and they sure seem expensive. But if you look into how much money is spent on valueless security theatre, it is a total drop in the bucket. But CrowdStrike hires security researchers! So what should the prices really be? For which vulnerabilities? The SolarWinds issue is probably worth more than $10m, if people are willing to pay 100x more to CrowdStrike for nothing. reply necovek 13 hours agorootparentIt's not as simple: those billions of dollars are not just for this particular issue, or even just for security support. It's also a difference between keeping a software engineer on staff and hiring a contractor as needed. One is cheaper for the company even if the hourly rate is higher. The better question is how we can improve the overall security of the software we write, which this article is more focused on. But we understand that there will be bugs, and security bugs even, no matter how hard we try. Even DJB (of qmail fame) and Knuth (of TeX and TAOCP fame) pay out bug bounties, and they heavily focus on software correctness over large feature sets. reply saagarjha 14 hours agorootparentprevThe real question here is who is willing to pay $10 million for such a bug. reply tptacek 51 minutes agorootparentNobody.

Our idea is straightforward: after a decade of auditing code and writing exploits, we've accumulated a wealth of experience. So, why not teach these agents to replicate what we do during bug hunting and exploit writing? Of course, the LLMs themselves aren't sufficient on their own, so we've integrated various program analysis techniques to augment the models and help the agents understand more complex and esoteric code. reply simonw 18 hours agorootparentWhen you call these things “agents” what do you mean by that? Is this a system prompt combined with some defined tools, or is it a different definition? reply tinco 11 hours agorootparentAn agent in this context is software that does LLM prompt results to determine its next action, often looping to iteratively get to a good result. reply dogma1138 8 hours agorootparentprevAre you going to publish your RAG strategy? reply wslh 17 hours agoparentprevCongrats! ELI5: what insights do you have NOW that were not published/researched extensively in academic papers and/or publicly discussed yet? reply sim7c00 10 hours agoprevthis is really impressive work. coverage guided and especially directed fuzing can be extremely difficult. its mentioned fuzzing is not a dumb technique. I think the classical idea is kind of dumb, in the sense of 'dumb fuzzers' but these days there is tons of intelligence built around it now aand poured into it, but i've always thought its now beyond the classic idea of fuzz testing. i had colleagues who poured their soul into trying to use git commit info etc. to try and help find potentially bad code paths and then coverage guided fuzzing trying to get in there. I really like the little note at the bottom about this. adding such layers kind of does make it lean towards machine learning nowadays, and id think perhaps fuzzing is not the right term anymore. i dont think many people are actually still simply generating random inputs and trying to crash programs like that. this is really exciting new progress around this type of field guys. well done! cant wait to see what new tools and techniques will be yielded from all of this research. Will you guys be open to implementing something around libafl++ perhaps? i remember we worked with that extensively. As a lot of shops use that already it might be cool to look at integration into such tools or would you think this deviates so far it'll amount to a new kind of tool entirely? Also, the work on datasets might be really valuable to other researchers. there was a mention of wasted work but labeled sets of data around cve, bug and patch commits can help a lot of folks if theres new data in there. this kind of makes me miss having my head in this space :D cool stuff and massive congrats on being finalists. thanks for the extensive writeup! reply garlic_chives 21 hours agoprevAIxCC is an AI Cyber Challenge launched by DARPA and ARPA-H.

Photo By Lukas Schulze/Sportsfile for Collision via Getty Images Former Google CEO and chairman Eric Schmidt has made headlines for saying that Google was blindsided by the early the rise of ChatGPT because its employees decided that “working from home was more important than winning.” The comment was made in front of Stanford students during a recent interview, video of which was removed from the university’s YouTube channel after Schmidt’s gaffe was widely picked up by the press. I managed to watch most of Schmidt’s chat with Stanford’s Erik Brynjolfsson before it was taken down, however, and something else he said stands out. (You can still read the full transcript here.) While talking about a future world in which AI agents can do complex tasks on behalf of humans, Schmidt says: If TikTok is banned, here’s what I propose each and every one of you do: Say to your LLM the following: “Make me a copy of TikTok, steal all the users, steal all the music, put my preferences in it, produce this program in the next 30 seconds, release it, and in one hour, if it’s not viral, do something different along the same lines.” That’s the command. Boom, boom, boom, boom. A bit later, Schmidt returns to his TikTok example and says: So, in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor — and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybody’s music — what you would do if you’re a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off, then you’d hire a whole bunch of lawyers to go clean the mess up, right? But if nobody uses your product, it doesn’t matter that you stole all the content. And do not quote me. At this point, Brynjolfsson points out that, “You’re on camera,” to which Schmidt responds: Yeah, that’s right. But you see my point. In other words, Silicon Valley will run these tests and clean up the mess. And that’s typically how those things are done. While Schmidt stepped away from his chairman role at Google in 2015, he remains influential in Silicon Valley and a prolific investor in startups. During this same talk at Stanford, he touts his investment in the AI startup Mistral and being “a licensed arms dealer” to the US military. He also calls Sam Altman “a close friend,” and recalls a recent dinner he had with Elon Musk while praising what the Tesla CEO “gets out of people” who work for him. I emailed Schmidt and Brynjolfsson requesting comment about the removal of their chat from YouTube and haven’t heard back yet. Schmidt earlier told The Wall Street Journal that he “misspoke about Google and their work hours” and requested the video be taken down.

    "commentBody": "Ex-Google CEO: AI startups can steal IP and hire lawyers to 'clean up the mess' (theverge.com)142 points by stalfosknight 3 hours agohidepastfavorite153 comments omoikane 2 hours agoIt's hard to tell if what Eric Schmidt was saying was a joke, an observation, or a recommendation. One interpretation from the context of the transcript seem to be \"AI can make/steal stuff and manual intervention (lawyers) can clean those up later\". Another interpretation from the context of Eric Schmidt being a savvy businessman is that people should go ahead and solve all the technical challenges first, and everything else can come later because if the technical problems aren't solved successfully, the other things won't matter. I can't tell if he is mostly responding to the room or not. This whole transcript[1] is more than 10k words, everyone will probably find an interpretation from random snippets that matches their perceived reality. [1] https://github.com/ociubotaru/transcripts/blob/main/Stanford... reply xivzgrev 1 hour agoparentHe’s dead serious. Uber got its start by flouting taxi rules. By the time the backlash started uber/lyft were too popular for governments to shut down so instead most governments created an awkward different category for them, so there’s at least some regulation applying to them. If Uber had tried to work thru the regulation they would have never gotten off the ground or have been as loved by users. Taxis in many ways suck, and that was their opening. Speaking of which…Uber is a master of regulatory influence. When California threatened to classify their drivers as employees, they successfully passed a proposition (prop 22) with the California public that promised more benefits for drivers…but kept them as independent contractors. reply Manuel_D 1 hour agorootparentNot really. Taxi medallions are required to let you pick up someone else that hails you on the street. It is not required for a drive scheduled elsewhere like over the phone or the Internet. They weren't breaking laws, at least in the US. Most of the regulations applied to Uber were new regulations introduced after their ride to popularity, often crafted with the express purpose of curbing Lyft and Uber. reply kelnos 17 minutes agorootparentYou're definitely misremembering history, then. Hailing is certainly a \"category definer\", but what Uber was doing in the beginning was definitely not kosher in many US jurisdictions. Ordering on-demand in an app was seen by regulators as much more taxi-like than scheduling a black car for a particular date, time, and place. Uber was originally called \"Ubercab\", and changed their name specifically to attempt to distance themselves from traditional taxi service. reply diggan 1 hour agorootparentprev> Not really. Taxi medallions are required to let you pick up someone else that hails you on the street. It is not required for a drive scheduled elsewhere like over the phone or the Internet. They weren't breaking laws, at least in the US. Maybe not in the US, but Uber was (at one point) banned in multiple locations in (at least) Europe because they flagrantly ignoring existing laws. In some locations, like Netherlands, Uber was fined and told it was illegal, but continued service anyway up until their offices were raided, then they finally shut down. reply tracerbulletx 2 hours agoparentprevIt's not specifically about technical problems. He's saying that you need to just go all in on getting traction and not constantly be worrying about things that aren't going to matter if you never get it. It's the same thing as people who just opine about how they'll handle the big server bills, or how they'll scale to a billion users, or how they'll deal with regulations, when they haven't gotten their first user yet. reply esafak 1 hour agorootparentDo you remember Napster? They went all in on getting traction, succeeded, then got crushed by the music industry. Ignoring the law only works if you are bankrolled. Don't try this at home, kids. reply BobbyJo 1 hour agorootparentYes, but how did things work out for the founders? reply sillyfluke 7 minutes agorootparentThis is kind of an amusing point to consider since we were talking about Kim Dotcom's extradition just moments ago. So is the point to try it if you've got Napster level success but not Megaupload level success? And since there is no way to know which level of success you are going to achieve beforehand, the note of caution still makes sense I guess? reply sroussey 1 hour agorootparentprevOr the founders of Uber and Lyft? Legal gray area. They could have waited years and years and tried to get laws passed to allow their business to function with a clean slate of legality, but bureaucrats would have never allowed it. reply stale2002 1 hour agorootparentprevNapster is an amazing example. They are a massive success story. Sean Parker is doing great. It worked out for him. So the point stands. If you get serious traction, the worst that can happen is your current company goes under, years down the line, after you have cashed out and you then fail upwards into being a successful tech celebrity. This is all a much better outcome than nobody caring about your product, as you \"followed the rules\", hampered yourself, and ended up with zero users. reply ninkendo 1 hour agorootparentAs Sean Parker's character in The Social Network's line reads: \"You want to buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLgpUEpaUVs reply petesergeant 1 hour agorootparentprevThat’s why you’ve heard of Napster, and Shawn and Sean have money. reply esafak 1 hour agorootparentI've heard of other failed companies too; that's not saying much. Did the founders make money off Napster? How? reply pas 1 hour agorootparentprevostensibly Napster is the exception that makes the rule, etc. reply ryandrake 2 hours agorootparentprevThis advice kind of feels like \"Don't pay your taxes. Just go all in on enjoying your life and not constantly be worrying about things that aren't going to matter if you die. Worry about it later if the IRS goes after you.\" You really should be preparing for the future and operating above board, even from day one. reply nostrademons 1 hour agorootparentNote that rich people (and at least one prominent ex-President, and I don't think he's the only one) actually do operate by that principle. They go on and enjoy their life, largely don't pay their taxes, and then hire an army of lawyers and accountants to clean up the mess when the IRS goes after them. I was raised to play by the rules and do everything by the book, but sometimes I wonder if that's just something that people who have no intention of playing by the rules say to screw over us gullible people. reply gruez 1 hour agorootparent>Note that rich people (and at least one prominent ex-President, and I don't think he's the only one) actually do operate by that principle. They go on and enjoy their life, largely don't pay their taxes, and then hire an army of lawyers and accountants to clean up the mess when the IRS goes after them. While many rich people do commit tax fraud, it's worth nothing it's usually not as straightforward as \"largely don't pay their taxes\". It's not like they get a bill from the IRS and just refuse to pay it. Instead, they use a combination of legally gray tactics to reduce their tax obligations. eg. for peter thiel, he put a bunch of paypal stock in a roth IRA pre-IPO, allowing him to avoid taxes on much of his exit. Was this legal? Was the valuation he used when he put the stock in the roth IRA correct or artificially low? You could argue either way, so you could plausibly do it while keeping a clean conscience. The same applies to AI startups. They argue what they're doing is covered under fair use, and there's plausible legal arguments/precedent supporting that. It's not like they're doing something obviously illegal like duplicating DVDs and selling them at a shady street stall. Also it's unclear what \"prominent ex-President\" you're referring to, but the wikipedia article for donald trump only says his foundation was charged, not him personally. reply ryandrake 1 hour agorootparentprevYou're absolutely right about that. Unfortunately there is a parallel consequence-free life track for rich people. My comment wasn't about them. reply matthewdgreen 2 hours agorootparentprevAnother interpretation is that (1) copyright interests are over-protected (at least) in US law because publishing industries are very influential, and that this policy overweights their short-term profit motive and underweights other interests that might benefit from looser enforcement (as the Constitution puts it: \"promot[ing] the progress of science and useful arts.\") And simultaneously, (2) if you can actually demonstrate such an interest (in particular: a profitable business that cannot exist when copyright law is fully enforced), the courts and publishers won't actually shut you down, but will settle for a cut of the new revenue you created. reply seanmcdirmid 2 hours agorootparentprevYou don’t have to pay income taxes until you record profit, at least, so that really is like what he is saying. The IRS is not going to think this is weird, many (most even) startups never get to the point of paying taxes, and non-profits by definition don’t. reply ryandrake 2 hours agorootparentObviously I'm not talking specifically about corporate taxes, here. In fact the example was about personal taxes. It's a generality about the attitude of \"Ignore the rules, do what you have to now, and worry about the consequences later.\" reply sroussey 1 hour agorootparentNo, it more like “rewrite the rules” either by litigation or politics. reply tracerbulletx 2 hours agorootparentprevIf something is clearly illegal or immoral to you don't do it. This is more about if its ambiguous or you believe your companies goal is a good thing and it's unclear if you will get sued for it. reply salawat 1 hour agorootparent>If something is clearly illegal or immoral to you don't do it. You're posting on a forum run by a group that asks applicants when they've skirted the law to get something done. Your use of the modifier \"clearly\" here is pointless. Remember; you've literally lived through companies funneling in investment dollars into things like Project Greyball, which was entirely intended to gaslight law enforcement/regulators. Or who have regularly tried to financial engineer or corporately structure their way out of culpability long enough to successfully execute on pump-n-dumps. Or who birthed the entire sector of \"totally not a bank/financial institution\" that is the cryptocurrency space. reply uoaei 26 minutes agoparentprevI can't tell if techies have fused rose-colored glasses to their faces or if they really think the people who win are nice people who follow rules! reply cyanydeez 2 hours agoparentprevIf you make enough money, you just purchase laws. No need to try and decontextualize. reply gruez 1 hour agorootparent> you just purchase laws. What sort of favorable laws did google or ai startups \"purchase\"? reply stale2002 1 hour agorootparentFor AI startups it is too early in the cycle for them to do that. The first lawsuit on copyright infringement only just made it to discovery last week! In this context though, The favorable laws that they will \"purchase\" would of course be either a favorable court outcome saying that training on other people's data without permission is fair use (in at least some circumstances), or otherwise a new law that says that explicitly. AI startups have a couple years left of runway before even the first lawsuit is settled, so that is more than enough time to get traction and takeover the market, given how useful AI is likely to be. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 2 hours agoparentprevI don’t know if there are just too many kids around or if everyone has a short memory, but Eric Schmidt was in his heyday know. for awkwardly sticking his foot in it with tactless comments like this. reply choppaface 2 hours agoparentprevSchmidt oversaw lots of “stealing” at Google, from Google Books (Author’s Guild), to Image Search (e.g. Perfect10 etc, before even Getty), the French press .. all before Viacom vs Youtube and others. Schmidt was also notably part of the tech no-poach / wage suppression scheme ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust... ). He knows very well the spectrum of stealing and liability. In this talk he’s pounding his chest in front of young investors and executives to celebrate what he got away with and to inflate his brand. Contrast though with TK, who through Greyballing (among other things) wanted to “steal” the taxi market and make himself and Uber above the law. So Schmidt’s raw ambition is no joke. But historically his actions have been perhaps more conservative than those of others. reply gruez 1 hour agorootparent>Schmidt oversaw lots of “stealing” at Google, from Google Books (Author’s Guild), to Image Search (e.g. Perfect10 etc, before even Getty), the French press .. all before Viacom vs Youtube and others. At least for Author’s Guild and Perfect10, google successfully argued fair use and therefore it wasn't really \"stealing\". I'm too lazy to research the other cases. Despite this, you're seemingly displeased at google's behavior despite it being ruled legal. What should have they done? reply jackcosgrove 56 minutes agorootparentLegality is the lowest bar of ethical behavior. reply izacus 12 minutes agorootparentThere's nothing ethical about calling violation of purchased IP protection \"stealing\" either. It's a set of laws by encumbents to protect monopolies. And you can trace a lot of US monopolies and lack of healthy competitive markets directly back to those laws. reply gruez 8 minutes agorootparentprevAnd what is your line for \"ethical behavior\"? What makes your line more valid than what AI companies think is ethical? reply greenthrow 2 hours agoparentprevWhether he was \"joking\" or not this is the playbook they have been running for years now. reply InsideOutSanta 2 hours agorootparentIt's Heisenberg's Joke.

But the reason this is on HN (for the millionth time) is because Eric said it, and Google bad, or whatever. reply baxtr 2 hours agoprevThis is only half true. It needs to read: “Any VC backed startup can steal IP and hire lawyers to clean up the mess” If you have money, you can usually buy influence and also buy your way out of a ‘mess’.

The playbook has been in operation for over a decade. reply gruez 1 hour agorootparent>Uber was an illegal taxi service That claim is at best, speculative. According to wikipedia they won every case brought against them, so as far as the law is concerned they didn't do anything illegal. >Taxi companies sued Uber in numerous American cities, alleging that Uber's policy of violating taxi regulations was a form of unfair competition or a violation of antitrust law.[80] Although some courts did find that Uber intentionally violated the taxi rules, Uber prevailed in every case, including the only case to proceed to trial.[81] reply sroussey 1 hour agorootparentThere is a reason they changed their name. reply throwaway290 1 hour agoparentprevIt's the playbook of ClosedAI (and I guess why Microsoft pretends it is legally independent and not its vassal). reply neilv 3 hours agoprevAll the sketchy people know that, but they don't say it in public. > [...] during a recent talk at Stanford Minting the next batch of sketchy people. reply csouzaf 2 hours agoprevIt's crazy to see the repercussions of the talk he gave at Stanford, even after the video was made private by the Stanford YouTube channel.

If there's rules we all need to comply with, it can be upsetting to see others proudly not do it and get away with it because they're rich. That has little to do with whether the rules were sound in the first place. It's more about fairness. And I've found \"hackers\" to be nothing if not fair - in a \"chaotic good\" way perhaps. reply tgma 5 minutes agorootparentSo you define \"fairness\" as always following the rules as is. That's objectively false. Many historical examples. reply teddyh 25 minutes agoparentprevThe problem is people at large companies creating these AI models, wanting the freedom to copy artists’ works when using it, but these large companies also want to keep copyright protection intact, for their regular business activities. They want to eat the cake and have it too. And they are arguing for essentially eliminating copyright for their specific purpose and convenience, when copyright has virtually never been loosened for the public’s convenience, even when the exceptions the public asks for are often minor and laudable. If these companies were to argue that copyright should be eliminated because of this new technology, I might not object. But now that they come and ask… no, they pretend to already have, a copyright exception for their specific use, I will happily turn around and use their own copyright maximalist arguments against them. (Copied from a comment of mine written more than two years ago: ) reply tgma 1 minute agorootparentI agree with your characterization. It's probable that they will have to weaken their existing positions and pivot to the new world of copyright. Nevertheless that is a good argument.

That is a tiny fraction of the number of people who did it. There are companies that got destroyed due to lawsuits as well, I wouldn't say lawsuits are less of an issue for companies than people, significant lawsuits are very rare in either case. > Claiming that there's anything illegal about adblockers is a real stretch It is legally questionable, I didn't say it was illegal we were talking about questionable actions. reply lucianbr 46 minutes agorootparentSo in which sense was it \"hammered out\"? Since not many people got in trouble for it, is it now legal to torrent copyrighted content, and to block ads? If you're claiming it's still legally questionable, then it was not \"hammered out\" at all, was it? reply sroussey 1 hour agorootparentprevI can think up a few legal ideas off the top of head in regards to adblockers: From a copyright point of view… adblockers make a derivative work so they should pay the content maker for those. Those are worth orders of magnitude more than the ad would have paid. Or maybe unfair business practice. Their whole aim is deprive another business of income. Or how they shake down companies for money so the blocker becomes less effective on that site. Just ideas reply lucianbr 1 hour agorootparentprevPeople did get in trouble for pirating content. That you don't know any of them personally is irrelevant. I don't personally know anyone who got radiation poisoning, so I suppose radiation is not toxic? Anyway, you downloading torrents is in no way \"hammering out a gray area\". It's just you being a small fish and slipping under the radar. The area is just as gray as before. Try to do something significant with the pirated content, as the AI startups do, and you'll immediately get trouble. reply stale2002 1 hour agorootparent> Try to do something significant with the pirated content, as the AI startups do, and you'll immediately get trouble. No they won't. 80% of the people I meet at tech events either have an AI startup or are working at one. Basically all of them are doing legally questionable stuff, when it comes to copyright law. Anyone who has ever trained a model, or finetuned a model, is likely using other people's data. This is universal. It is almost everyone. And yet, despite this being a gray area, basically nobody is getting into trouble for this. We are all getting away with it. And there is only a singular lawsuit about this against like 4 companies and nobody else. (midjourney, runwayML, Stable diffusion, and deviant art) So the point stands. Almost nobody is getting into trouble, despite this behavior being widespead everywhere, and if you don't do the same thing then you are going to fall behind and fail. reply lucianbr 52 minutes agorootparent> Anyone who has ever trained a model, or finetuned a model, is likely using other people's data. This is universal. It is almost everyone. Citation needed. The whole reason there's no legal trouble is that it cannot be proved conclusively that they used copyrighted data for training. \"when the CTO of OpenAI is asked if Sora was trained on YouTube videos, she says “actually I’m not sure” and refuses to discuss all further questions about the training data\". Why do you think she's denying the obvious? reply stale2002 46 minutes agorootparentJust look around at all the AI companies that are doing this, dude. Its a lot of people. So the point stands, a large number of people are doing this. Meaning that, yes a lot of people are getting away with this, and only like 4 companies are being sued. This means that the point about people immediately getting in trouble is wrong, given that a lot of people are doing this. Can you directly address this point, instead of giving a 2 word response that doesn't really address the point, and instead tries to attack the argument on a technicality because I didn't include a 20 page research paper in my social media comment? reply lucianbr 33 minutes agorootparentHonestly I'm having a really hard time arguing that regular joes are not on the same footing with megacorps as related to \"legal gray areas\". It's like asking me to prove the sky is blue. Whereas of course, anything you claim, is \"obvious, just look around dude\". What's the claim here, that now torrenting is officially legal? People have been torrenting, there's no consequences, it's been hammered out, now it's a-ok? reply scarmig 2 hours agorootparentprevMost of the hammering out is giant corporations hammering each other, trying to forge a niche to more effectively extract rents. The solution is minimal or no government intervention to create state-sponsored monopolies. When you do have those interventions, sometimes corporation A will win, sometimes corporation B will win, but the small scale individual will always lose. reply wombatpm 2 hours agorootparentprevWhen things are hammered out, one party is the hammer and the other party is the nail. reply sdoering 2 hours agorootparentprevI think the jury is still out on that one. I think the initial idea to make disparate knowledge available more easily is a great one. And as old as recorded knowledge. So the idea of a search engine in itself is a great one imho. But the idea of an ad-display-engine is imho not so clear cut. Especially when it is a de facto monopoly. Especially when the monopolist can go the route of active enshittification, making stuff harder to find just to increase ad revenue.

If an AI agent becomes just massively useful, and then a judge says that it's impossible to run it profitably with the current interpretation of copyright law, the agents won't go away: Copyright will change to make the agents legal.

    "originLink": "https://hkalbasi.github.io/zngur/",
    "originBody": "Zngur Zngur (/zængɑr/) is a C++/Rust interop tool. It tries to expose arbitrary Rust types, methods, and functions while preserving its semantics and ergonomics as much as possible. Using Zngur, you can use arbitrary Rust crate in your C++ code as easily as using it in normal Rust code, and you can write idiomatic Rusty API for your C++ library inside C++. Idea Rust and C++ are similar languages but with some important differences. Particularly: Rust is a memory-safe language with a strong boundary between safe and unsafe declared using the unsafe keyword, C++ is an unsafe language with no such difference and keyword. C++ has macro-like templates, which support variadic, specialization and are checked at instantiation time. Rust generics, on the other hand, are type-checked at definition time using trait bounds. Rust move is a memcpy with compiler support for not destructing the moved out of variable, but C++ move can execute arbitrary code. In all of these differences, C++ has more freedom relative to the Rust: Rust considers C++ functions as unsafe, but C++ will happily call Rust code (even unsafe) as there is no difference between it and normal C++ code. Every rust generic code is a valid C++ template, but not vice versa. C++ can simulate Rust moves very easily (by doing an actual memcpy of data, and tracking the state of destruction in a boolean flag) but Rust has difficulty with C++ moves. Specially, since Rust assumes that every type is Rust-moveable, it can never store C++ objects by value, just over some indirection and Pin. So, Zngur allows you to use arbitrary Rust types in C++, store them by value in the C++ stack, and call arbitrary Rust methods and functions on them. But it doesn't bridge any C++ type into Rust, since it is not possible with the same ergonomic. Instead, Zngur allows you to write a rusty wrapper for your C++ library. It allows you to implement Rust traits for C++ types and cast them to the Box, implement inherent methods on Rust types, implement Rust traits for Rust types, and expose bare functions from C++ that operate on Rust types.

A far more important point is to address is that any FFI story with C++ that’s well executed is going to be great for the Rust ecosystem, and historically the community’s commitment to C++ interop has seemed tepid at best. Even if one admits that Rust is strictly better than C++ for problems in the relevant domains, which seems an extraordinary claim that exceeds extraordinary evidence, there is still an ocean of C++ that we just can’t rewrite in even a decade, maybe not in a century. There are use cases where Rust is just strictly a better choice: anything with an attack surface like a shell or an SSH daemon, or probably even a browser is an obvious candidate for a language with better reasoning about common attack vectors. I trust my Rust user land a lot more than my C userland. But the “rewrite everything in Rust and push that via bad interop” is limiting the adoption of a cool language. I’m a big fan of efforts to be more incremental. reply saghm 9 minutes agoparent> But the “rewrite everything in Rust and push that via bad interop” is limiting the adoption of a cool language. For what it's worth, I've rarely heard \"rewrite it in Rust\" pushed by the most influential and productive members of the Rust ecosystem. I think the disparity here is that the people pushing the more extreme agenda aren't the same ones making major projects that people use, so it turns out that most of the stuff being made is for writing new software since that's what the people making it are interested in. reply tialaramex 8 hours agoparentprev> we just can’t rewrite in even a decade, maybe not in a century. The former claim seems unlikely as stated (\"cannot\") but is at least plausible in practice (\"will not\"). The latter makes no sense. C++ didn't exist fifty years ago, so you're asking that we believe somehow C++ was so well suited to some unspecified problems that rewriting software in a better language will take more than twice as long. reply cgio 6 hours agorootparentRebuilding existing features tends to be deprioritised against building new. In that sense, the process for rebuilding might indeed take longer, even if the new approach is faster to deliver (which in the case discussed probably is not) as it does not happen in vacuum but in parallel with other developments. reply wavemode 3 hours agorootparentThen you would agree that it is more \"will not\" than \"cannot\" reply gumby 29 minutes agorootparentYou are arguing a distinction without a difference. If socially one could not muster the will to do something then it will never happen -- it cannot be done. We certainly could reduce the use of fossil fuels by over 90% in a few months -- global nuclear war would probably work -- but I hope nobody has the will to make that happen. Conversely we could reduce them by that much over a 30 year span, but currently lack the will. So in that case the distinction would make sense. But few are willing to \"replace this working thing for a small gain\" (and you can argue about rust but when something works and the downside is a statistical risk demonstrably of low probability* ) it will be hard to find many people willing to invest in it. Eventually these old programs will be replaced but they won't be replaced with functional equivalents, any more than, say, wired home phones were replaced with fibre optic connections. They will be replaced with something de novo instead. * nerds like us may say the risk is significant but the level of uproar in security breaches is negligible in practice and the actual incidence of bugs due to things like use-after-free is likewise tiny. reply codetrotter 6 hours agorootparentprevI mean, there’s a lot of systems out there now that are so relied upon by other systems and people that you literally have to probably be bug for bug compatible with the existing system if you’re gonna have any chance of doing a rewrite of it in another language. That kind of thing takes time. And all of that time spent is also time that you continuously will have to justify to the executives why exactly we are doing this rewrite again and why there have been 0 new features added to the system because everyone has been busy with the rewrite. Or you assign just part of the people to the rewrite and the rest of the teams continue adding features to the existing system, and now you have to constantly play catch-up. Or everyone is responsible for both rewriting and for adding features, and new features are added into the legacy code and then also written in the new language. It’s possible. I’ve been on teams that successfully rewrote legacy software in Rust. But until it literally becomes something that directly impacts revenue in an indisputable way – say through fines imposed for security incidents and those incidents being due to memory safety – there’s still a lot of organizations that will completely refuse these kinds of rewrites no matter how good the evidence is that they should be doing so for many reasons. reply pjmlp 11 hours agoprevThis kind of tools are great, as C++ isn't going away any time soon, and Rust is decades away to be relevant in some domains, specially those where C++ only recently took over C. reply uneekname 16 hours agoprevI've been learning Rust and really enjoying it, but the primary downside (compared to C++) is the lack of access to the large, well-tested libraries that exist in C++.

As much as I like Rust, at some point it's a better idea to use C++ to tap into libraries like that. Does anyone have thoughts about how mature Zngur/CXX/etc. are for a project like mine?

Unfortunately it chooses to just assume your C++ is sound, it does explicitly warn you that you're signing up for this, but realistically this just doubles down on the known bad assumption in C++ that programmers are infallible. Rather than (like Rust's native C FFI) marking the arbitrary C++ as unsafe, Zngur chooses to have you explicitly opt in if you want your code marked unsafe. We know from years of practical experience that C++ programmers rely heavily on unstated assumptions for the correctness of code, a practice which does not scale. A very large proportion of the C++ stdlib itself has a narrow contract, yet few practitioners memorise these contracts and they're unchecked - disaster looms. reply ogoffart 10 hours agorootparentprevFor calling C++ libraries from Rust, there is also https://crates.io/crates/cpp reply dkersten 13 hours agorootparentprevIt seems to do both: https://hkalbasi.github.io/zngur/tutorial.html#calling-c-fro...

It was a lot of work but the bindings seem to work well. reply hkalbasi 10 hours agoparentprevZngur allows you to write functions operating over Rust types, adding methods to Rust types and implementing Rust traits for C++ and Rust types inside C++.

If anyone wants a great introduction to the context and the bigger picture, there's this great article from the NYT in 2022, written by an excellent reporter who lives in Brazil. I highly recommend this article to anyone who hasn't lived in Brazil for the last 10 years: \"To Defend Democracy, Is Brazil’s Top Court Going Too Far?\" https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/26/world/americas/bolsonaro-... https://archive.is/plQFT It covers the judge at the center of the current issue: \"Mr. Moraes has jailed five people without a trial for posts on social media that he said attacked Brazil’s institutions. He has also ordered social networks to remove thousands of posts and videos with little room for appeal. And this year, 10 of the court’s 11 justices sentenced a congressman to nearly nine years in prison for making what they said were threats against them in a livestream.\" Rumble has been blocked in Brazil for over a year, and WhatsApp and Telegram have been briefly blocked multiple times. reply EuAndreh 48 minutes agoparentFrom the same article: > Brazil’s Supreme Court has drastically expanded its power to counter the antidemocratic stances of Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters.

A View On Moraes' Decisions In Face Of The Crisis Created By Bolsonaro 3.

It's not like \"oh, we only judge constitutional matters\", as it happens in serious countries. I really mean ANYTHING. There is run of the mill lawsuits involving defamation that the court decided to judge out of the bat. The accuser is a mainstream journalist (mainstream media as a whole have been – essentially – acting as public relations of the court – similar to how they acted as public relations for Biden during the 2020 elections btw), the accused part being another brazilian journalist living abroad, called Allan dos Santos (Moraes personally hates the guy and failed to extradite him from the US countless times - USA authorities essentially answering \"it's only words, this is covered by our first amendment\"). And instead of this lawsuit following the normal procedure as any other defamation lawsuit in Brazil. Moraes decided to elevate this case to automatically judge it in the highest instance of the country. His excuse? “Oh, Dos Santos is investigated in other procedures here, so I think they are related\". And this has been essentially their trick to investigate/trial anything they want. They say it's related. Hell, the Brazilian Supreme Court decide to investigate Ellon Musk himself.

They also broke down the number of takedowns against verified journalists and news outlets, which was led by India (114 takedowns), Turkey (78), Russia (55), and Pakistan (48), and Brazil was down the list with 8. It would be nice to have a more recent version of this report to see which way the tides have shifted. reply TylerLives 1 hour agorootparentThis might be misleading. If old Twitter was preemptively taking down posts that certain American or European organizations wanted taken down, this wouldn't show in the transparency reports at all.

Sure. He’s a strong authoritarian figure with lasting political power. Fighting Erdogan is a losing fight. Moraes is less powerful.

And then things like salespeople on the ground who can visit advertisers' offices, go to conventions, etc. If you want to actually be a viable business in a particular country at a large scale, it often becomes impossible to avoid having to incorporate there and hire people locally, even if your actual product is entirely digital. reply praptak 45 minutes agorootparentIt also doesn't help if your customers can neither legally pay you nor account your invoices as costs for the tax purposes. reply praptak 1 hour agoparentprevCountries can do more than just try to block network traffic.

Due to the above, I am adamantly against \"free speech\" in the context of algorithm-driven social media, and I wish that people complaining about being censored on social media would stop using the term, because they're (knowingly or not) conflating two very different ideas. reply olalonde 1 hour agoprevPrimary source: https://x.com/GlobalAffairs/status/1824819053061669244 reply hexage1814 2 hours agoprevBrazil is essentially living under a judicial dictatorship for the last 5 years or so.

The second key element, which more implied in the modern definition of dictator, is that it stay in position of power against the will of the majority of it’s country inhabitants.

He strong armed the weimar republic to be named in chancellor, and only after that he held some referendum to validate his decision. Also, when he is named chancellor, it’s been a while since the democratic value of weimar were hurting. Paul Von Hindenburg started as soon as 1930 to govern through executive act, ignoring and/or strong arming the Reichstag. Not really what I would call a healthy democratic government. Also, Hitler was named as chancellor through a plot of the current weimar government to avoid calling new elections, like the laws said they must. reply dankle 2 hours agorootparentprevThats exactly how it works.

It’s not easy part, at least in a more-or-less healthy democracy.

Their excuse (both the court itself as well as the media trying to justify the court's actions) was/is something among the lines of \"Oh, Bolsonaro would establish a dictatorship [an hypothetical that never happen, Bolsonaro unlike the Supreme Court, never crossed a red line], so we will instead establish our actual dictatorship to prevent his dictatorship\". And here we are in 2024, Bolsonaro is not president anymore, the elections (organized by people who pretty much opposed Bolsonaro btw...) are over, but the Supreme Court is still arresting people. They are still having trials were the court is the accuser, the \"victim\", and the judge – all in the same figure. They are still ordering profiles on social media to be blocked. They are still trying to arrest journalists abroad. They are still sentencing protesters, or at best rioters, to 17 years in prison because they broke some stuff – they accuse those random people without any real power, random common people, to have threaten the rule of law. It's bad. reply marcosdumay 1 hour agorootparent> Bolsonaro unlike the Supreme Court, never crossed a red line Crossing the line and failing is not the same as \"never crossing the line\". Anyway, Bolsonaro was quite supportive of that same structure. Because he wanted the money-flow that came with it (previously illegal flow, but since 2021, well, it's up to be seen). Just like Lula, and Dilma, and Temer... reply thor-rodrigues 1 hour agorootparentprevIt sounds very misleading to frame those responsible for storming into the Congress on January 8th, while attempting to \"stop the steal\" that the elections supposedly were, as simply \"at best rioters, to 17 years in prison because they broke some stuff\".

You are omitting the fact that Bolsonaro made several allegations of voter fraud on social media, and Brazil had their own version of January 6th after he lost (what you called \"at best rioters\").

Crazy times. reply taway2024081712 1 hour agoparentprevThe seemingly unlimited[1] power of the Judiciary is showing its ugly head in many countries: Brazil, the US, Israel and many others. We take it as God-given word, but it's worth remembering that the theory of the separation of the Judiciary from the other powers came from the head of a single man, and maybe he was mistaken. There's no reason for judicial review, despite the name, be in the hands of the Judiciary and not Congress or other elected body. If laws are unclear, let those with the power to change it to determine its meaning and improve the wording. [1] Frankly, I believe this is Godel's loophole reply marcosdumay 1 hour agorootparentThe Brazilian Constitution doesn't even assign to the Judiciary unlimited power.

I believe his stand is principled, but he appears to have the shortcoming of often trying to apply concepts from the US legal and institutional framework to places where it simply doesn't apply, like trying to fit square pegs to round holes. This sent him into a wild goose chase in this case. reply epups 45 minutes agorootparentprevGreenwald is an odd one, I'll give you that. He seems to see this issue from a libertarian perspective. He would also say that Germany banning Nazi speech is censorship, for example.

That's an interesting perspective. The way I read our first amendment, it seems that the rights granted therein are a prerequisite for a free society. If Brazil's leaders are unwilling to allow a speech platform go uncensored, why not ban X? Should X have to comply with every country's censorship requests?

Even from the government (remember patriot act). reply ggreer 1 hour agoparentprevSome of the orders were not just to prevent people in Brazil from viewing certain things, but to take down content and ban users globally. The court also wanted Twitter to provide personal information of overseas accounts. reply quotemstr 1 hour agoparentprevThe UN declaration of human rights speaks to free expression being fundamental to human flourishing. As an American, I'm not terribly inclined to accept cultural relativism when it comes to censorship. Governments banning political speech they dislike is always and everywhere tyrannical. reply csouzaf 1 hour agorootparentI don't think it's comments they dislike. I think it's accounts spreading fake news and feeding a narrative of 'current government bad' to impose what they think is the right way. I mean, there are limits, and they're being imposed by the force of law reply quotemstr 1 hour agorootparentIt doesn't work that way. Any ability to ban \"fake news\" immediately becomes a vehicle for banning inconvenient news. It's part of human nature. I don't have to list the dozens recent examples of \"fake\" news turning out to be true. There's a reason that Orwell's censorship body was called the \"ministry of truth\". Governments shouldn't touch censorship for the same reason alcoholics shouldn't touch booze. reply fragmede 57 minutes agorootparentExcept it already does.

Your rights end where my nose begins, etc. reply arp242 1 hour agoprevI don't really use X, but I still have an account because it's just more convenient to view stuff with an account, and for better or worse, sometimes I want to view what people are saying. Typically I don't really bother flagging stuff, but recently I flagged two posts which seemed very obviously beyond the pale to me: \"Zelensky is an expert on false flags (he is jewish, obviously) like Bucha\" [1] \"Still think it's because they are \"Muslim\"? Wake up. Same story in every continent on global Earth. Southern equatorial dark skins have a higher demographic percentage of low IQ and low impulse control future criminals. It's not worth mixing. https://t.co/D0lQuEUV8L\" [2] (context here is the competitive racism riots in Britain last week, which makes it even worse IMO) Both flags were denied. Now, I don't really know about this specific disagreement or if blocking those accounts is reasonable or not, the story doesn't really have enough specifics on that. \"Spreading fake news and hate messages\" from governments can be used over-zealously or even in bad faith, but if the platform also doesn't do anything about naked unambiguous racism and antisemitism, then we clearly can't trust X on this either.

Musk bought it for $44 billion in October 2022. Over the first 13 months under Musk, we saw X internal memos marking themselves down to $19 billion, then Fidelity marked down their investment to a level implying a $15-16 billion valuation, then in November 2023 they marked it down again to $12.5 billion.

I'm a power user, I don't have some tremendous amount of bots as followers and I have made very out-of-reach friends and acquaintances on twitter. I get paid an okayish sum each month for posting on the platform and the most serious issue which was fixed earlier this year was the ***-in-bio spam. Everything works betters since Elon, the site runs better! - All the people who keep repeating the 'cesspool' argument don't use the service. It was a cesspool it's entire life. People say any website that doesn't agree with them 100% of the time is a cesspool. Reddit, Insta, Tiktok, etc: Cesspools for people who can't spend time online with people that disagree with them. I make $1k+ a month posting the same stuff I posted for free. I love the site more than ever, and I don't agree with Elon politically. and no i'm not a bot yaddah yaddah i really cannot get over how often people yap the same doom and gloom, commentators said the site was going down when he fired everyone - it works even better! reply peterfirefly 58 minutes agoparentprevThe second one isn't wrong, no matter how much you dislike it.

Obviously, and that's okay, but if you want to have a discussion platform then you need to deal with the worst of it one way or the other. Otherwise it's just going to regress to the nastiest. No normal person wants to casually engage with people like this, so when you let them free they will turn any thread into a toxic flamefest. When push comes to shove, very few people are 100% free speech absolutions. That would include people just replying \"fuck off you moron\", \"kill yourself n--er\", \"gas the Jews\", etc. etc. on every post. The internet makes it very easy for slightly unhinged people to spend a lot of time posting these types of things hundreds or thousands of times per day. So stuff like \"free speech includes things that are offensive to your sensibilities\" is just a discussion stopper truism. My post from a few years ago applies here: https://www.arp242.net/censorship.html reply somenameforme 46 minutes agorootparentX has already mentioned what they do in this regard. Posts that are excessively vulgar/crude/etc get shadowbanned. But it's the post, not the account.

    "originBody": "ThreadPlotter A toolkit for the design and fabrication of delicate punch needle embroidery using X-Y plotters_ What? ThreadPlotter is a toolkit that supports the designing, editing, and printing of images as punch needle embroidery using an X-Y plotter. It is a supplementary material for the paper: \"Plotting with Thread: Fabricating Delicate Punch Needle Embroidery with X-Y Plotters\" Shiqing He, Eytan Adar, to appear, DIS'20, Honorable Mention Award The following video briefly introduces the motivation for building this tool and the capability of the ThreadPlotter. You might also be interested in this 10 minutes presentation that goes over the project in depth. If you are interested in using this toolkit, please consider citing our paper:Plotting with Thread: Fabricating Delicate Punch Needle Embroidery with X-Y Plotters How? To convert your X-Y plotter into a punch needle fabricator, we will follow the following steps: Ensure that your plotter is suitable for the task. (tutorial 1) Acquire or create several physical components such as needle, fabric, and frame. (tutorial 2) Design a punch needle pattern. tutorial 3: pattern making overview tutorial 4: advanced examples #in progress We highly recommend that you review our paper before getting started. When you are ready, click on each of the links above. Show us! Tell us! Ask us! Credit us! We are excited to see what you can create with this fabrication technique. The toolkit is developed and tested by Licia (on her plotter called \"Kitty\"). If you have questions about the toolkit, feel free to open up an issue in our github page.

But if you want a heavier thread then you might exceed your plotter’s limits. A tufting gun is one alternative, mentioned in one of the videos. While not fully automated, it speeds up the job significantly. reply teruakohatu 4 hours agorootparentI meant build a rug sized plotter. Would the stiching technique hold up to heavy wear of feet walking on it daily? reply jasonjayr 20 hours agoprev... there's no lock stitch underneath the fabric? if you pull on 1 thread the whole thing comes apart? I have a Husqvarana Designer Jade 35 Embroidery sewing machine, and the embroidery arm is just that: an x-y plotter/positioner that the computer can synchronize with the timing of the needle stitch. reply matthberg 20 hours agoparentYep, seems to be a drawback of the punch needle embroidery technique, though, not just this specific automation of it. From a light skimming of a couple of articles even hand-done work in this style lacks a lock stitch and relies on the friction of the fabric and tightly packed loops. Though that could make for an interesting ephemeral art piece, particularly paired with generated/algorithmic designs—a plotter that embroiders a piece and then unwinds it once finished, repeating in a loop and accumulating wear and knots and flaws. reply HideousKojima 15 hours agorootparentYou can hand stitch a lock stitch, you just have to pass a second spool through loops created from the first spool reply zimpenfish 10 hours agoparentprevFrom the videos I've seen, it's essentially the same as the way you make rugs - those are sealed on the back with a wash of glue and something like hessian. Presumably you can do the same here to \"lock it in\", as it were. (I did try punch needle once but managed to misread the instructions and threaded the needle wrong. Hilarity ensued.) reply lysace 19 hours agoparentprevThat triggered a memory: For some reason, in 1980s Sweden, it was felt that the grade 1-9 classes of textile crafting needed to \"get with the times\".

Github: https://github.com/hollisbrown/blendershortcuts me_bx 8 hours agoHi, the site looks nice. It's not working as intended on firefox, though, when autoplay is disabled (this might be the default now, I'm not sure). There is no way to know that the videos are videos, so the tips looks like a bunch of images. Clicking on them has no effect. The only way to play a video seems to right-click on it, and select 'Play'. You might want to add a 'play' button overlay on the videos thumbnail images, and/or show the controls by default... Hope this helps, reply hollisbrown 7 hours agoparentThank you very much for pointing this out, if a play button can be a fallback for those users only I'll put it in there. I'm a bit weirded out by this being the default even for muted videos. Does that somehow save bandwith because you only get sent one frame of the video? Because otherwise a muted video is just a series of images, and they dont block images by default, right? reply sjagoe 6 hours agorootparentI turn off autoplay globally because it's been abused for so long by some news sites, for example, that autoplay a video and then pin it to follow you as you scroll the article. I find any autoplay, even muted or no audio, to be more of a distraction then helpful in general. That said, I'm happy to make exceptions for well designed and intentioned sites, and so have allowed it on yours. reply akovaski 3 hours agorootparentprevIn case anybody is wondering, Firefox doesn't block muted videos by default. The above poster had changed their settings to block muted video, which can be overridden per site. reply geuis 12 hours agoprevThis is awesome! I'm not a professional user of Blender, but it's my only tool for working with and creating models for 3D printing. Never could develop a liking for Fusion360, though I recognize the advantages that CAD programs give. My biggest tip and gripe as a Mac user is to get a decent mouse button remapped utility and combine that with creating a Mac specific settings save file. For whatever reason, MacOS to this day doesn't recognize the extra mouse buttons that Windows does. Like Button4 etc. Even today, \"middle mouse\" button is one of the weirdest default choices Blender could make. The middle finger of either hand is an assisting finger, not primary. The index and ring fingers are stronger and it's weird to assign actions that require persistent pressing to a finger that has less strength than the other fingers. With a multi button mouse you can remap the middle button to the thumb. It's infinitely a better and more intuitive choice. Also, Blender's trackpad support on MacOS is horrendous, despite the amazing advances we keep getting everywhere else with each new release. I would love to see a new feature that is a voluntary checkbox for Mac users that enables a key binding layout dedicated to us. reply alanbernstein 6 hours agoparentWhat sort of things do you print? I like the idea of using blender, but I'm under the impression it wouldn't work well for the kind of things I work on, which require precise, adjustable measurements, and parametric design. (Like, custom hardware to mount thing A onto thing B) reply hollisbrown 6 hours agorootparentBlender is mainly for visualisation, but I've used it for 3D printing. You can set up models in a parametric way by using modifier stacks (e.g. screw, solidify, subdiv etc) or geometry nodes, but I imagine other software is more advanced in this regard, or needs less customization and thought. reply ilkke 7 hours agoparentprevDo check the settings! IIRC blender specifically has a toggle between a 2-button and 3-button mouse. Maybe even single button is possible, I remember using ctrl and alt with a stylus. reply prox 7 hours agoparentprevI think you can remap everything in Blender. Also my logitech mice come with remapping programs, does it come with one on mac? reply anon012012 11 hours agoprevBeautiful! Instead of adapting to Anki, you could add your own JS script to this page, which picks a random sample from the array of tiles, highlight it in white, and you need to press the corresponding shortcut to go to the next sample (using a dictionary). You could memorize the time-to-press to generate a finale score (if you're motivated to do so). I had implemented that algorithm to memorize videogames shortcuts. This could be a nice challenge for your skills! Maybe you could make another page for \"VS Code\" and that'd be niiiice. reply hollisbrown 8 hours agoparentThanks, and thanks for sharing, I love the idea and will think about it. Even though my intuition says it would be more productive if I put more time into adding content and polish to the existing concept, and people openend the actual software to practise their muscle memory. I won't make this for other software, because I don't have that level of expertise for anything else. I've spent years helping other blender users, this is why I feel confident to author the information in this particular case. reply maroonblazer 4 hours agorootparentLove your site! I googled your name and 'blender' but didn't find any training resources online. I'm a new Blender user and am on the hunt for resources beyond BlenderGuru's Donut tutorial (which is great, btw). Do you create any Blender educational content? reply hollisbrown 1 hour agorootparentIts a pseudonym but I dont have any educational content in my real name either, this is my first attempt to contribute. But the amount of quality content on youtube has been increasing steadily over the years, If I had to recommend 3, I'd say Grant Abbitt (Beginner), Erindale (Geonodes), Ian Hubert (for Inspiration). reply samstave 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is awesome - I was a Master at Autocad for decades, and it was because of mastering keyboard shortcuts for every thing I did and having a vast ustom keyboard mapping. (When I was learning Autocad in the early 90s I read one book \"The Abc's of Autocad\" -- and I did every lesson in that book ~five times, which taught me all the keymappings and I never had to read another book on Autocad.) To augment your learnings for blender here are my top: @HarryBlends is #1 must Blender Binge: https://www.youtube.com/@harryblends/videos You can actually follow along with his vids - they are such amazing production quality. https://www.youtube.com/@CartesianCaramel/videosI'm also posting this here because I assume many of your are professional web developers. I'm a learning hobbyist and wondering if there are any issues with the way I built the website. I ran Lighthouse over the site. Excellent scores! The one improvement I would suggest is to increase the contrast between your text and background. Currently the text is a little hard to read. Have great fun coding! reply hollisbrown 6 hours agoparentThanks! I wasn't aware of tools like Lighthouse, will have a look into how it rates things. Will also take a critical look at contrast again, thought it would be sufficient, and it quickly gets overwhelming in this layout. reply ilkke 7 hours agoprevGreat idea and execution, with the shortcut keys doubling as models. Certainly gets my visual memory engaged. Works great on Firefox android. Only thing I could wish for is sections like selection, sculpting, etc. Thanks for making this. reply hollisbrown 7 hours agoparentCheck out the filter in the top right corner menu. I think its too subtle and most people are missing it. The content is focused on modeling though, now that it has a tag system I might add other sections like sculpting, animation... reply acutesoftware 4 hours agoprevVery well done - it took me several attempts to get the hang of Blender and I still only know / used half those shortcuts. Thanks for the easy to use tips! reply Avisite 12 hours agoprevI have been using blender for years now, but still learned some useful shortcuts thanks to this. this is a great way to teach shortcuts, and is perfect for a quick reference on a second monitor. I might suggest a compact view as an option to try to fit more on screen at once, or just increasing the density. reply hollisbrown 8 hours agoparentCheers, happy to hear that! There already is a \"collapse\" button if you bring up the menu top right (maybe its too subtle?). Default browser zoom out (Ctrl -) should also work fine, so you can see all shortcuts at once, e.g. on a second monitor or on a beamer, if you're teaching a group of people. reply MrDisposable 12 hours agoprevThis is great, thank you. I have a Markdown file for Blender shortcuts I learned, but this seems to be more useful for remembering them. (BTW, found a typo: Seperate should be Separate) reply hollisbrown 8 hours agoparentThanks for pointing it out, that reminds me I should probably run the entire website through a spell checker / AI at least once. reply jithinraj 7 hours agoprevThis format is awesome and helps eliminate the fear of starting by making learning shortcuts easy and interesting. reply butz 8 hours agoprevAs a user with media autoplay blocked I find this website hard to use. Please consider adding play/pause buttons for each video or just keep video playback controls visible. And with blocking disabled, all videos are loaded at once, and when everything is playing at once it makes it harder to concentrate on one thing. You should consider adding some kind of lazy loading. Sad that loading=\"lazy\" is not natively supported on videos yet. reply hollisbrown 6 hours agoparentthanks! If a fallback is possible, I'll put it in. Any pointers how to go about the lazy loading? I want to keep it simple reply butz 2 hours agorootparentNo simple (native) solution yet, as far as I know. While iframe has loading=\"lazy\" support, it probably will be detrimental to accessibility. Could be a fun experiment, though. Maybe try setting preload to \"none\" on video? But this might be overridden by autoplay attribute. Solution that would require more work involves removing autoplay attribute from videos and using IntersectionObserver to check when video is inside viewport and start playing it. reply grues-dinner 9 hours agoprevOne JS file, one HTML file, one CSS file. Perfection. reply degosuke 12 hours agoprevGreat idea! For better retention maybe it can be done as an anki deck? reply hollisbrown 9 hours agoparentI knew about analog flash cards for learning but thanks for bringing anki to my attention! Do they support tiny videos instead of images?

There are four modes of operation (more on this in User Guide) : List users/channels Dumping messages and threads Creating a Slack Export in Mattermost or Standard modes. Emoji download mode. Slackdump accepts two types of input (see Dumping Conversations section): the URL/link of the channel or thread, OR the ID of the channel. Quick Start Download the latest release for your operating system from the releases page. (If you're using macOS, download Darwin executable). Unpack the archive to any directory. Run the ./slackdump or slackdump.exe executable (see note below). You know the drill: use arrow keys to select the menu item, and Enter (or Return) to confirm. By default, Slackdump uses the EZ-Login 3000 automatic login, and interactive mode. Note On Windows and macOS you may be presented with \"Unknown developer\" window, this is fine. Reason for this is that the executable hasn't been signed by the developer certificate. To work around this: on Windows: click \"more information\", and press \"Run Anyway\" button. on macOS: open the folder in Finder, hold Option and double click the executable, choose Run. Slackord2: Migrating to Discord If you're migrating to Discord, the recommended way is to use Slackord2 - a great tool with a nice GUI, that is compatible with the export files generated by Slackdump. User Guide For more advanced features and instructions, please see the User Guide. Previewing Results Once the data is dumped, you can use one of the following tools to preview the results: SlackLogViewer - a fast and powerful Slack Export viewer written in C++. Slackdump2Html - a great Python application that converts Slack Dump to a static browsable HTML, works on Dump mode files. slack export viewer - Slack Export Viewer is a well known viewer for slack export files. Using as a library Download: go get github.com/rusq/slackdump/v2 Example package main import ( \"context\" \"log\" \"github.com/rusq/slackdump/v2\" \"github.com/rusq/slackdump/v2/auth\" ) func main() { provider, err := auth.NewValueAuth(\"xoxc-...\", \"xoxd-...\") if err != nil { log.Print(err) return } sd, err := slackdump.New(context.Background(), provider) if err != nil { log.Print(err) return } _ = sd } See Using Custom Logger Slackdump uses a simple rusq/dlog as a default logger (it is a wrapper around the standard logger that adds Debug* functions). If you want to use the same default logger that Slackdump uses in your application, it is available as logger.Default. No doubts that everyone has their own favourite logger that is better than other miserable loggers. Please read below for instructions on plugging your favourite logger. Logrus Good news is logrus can be plugged in straight away, as it implements the logger.Interface out of the box. lg := logrus.New() sd, err := slackdump.New(context.Background(), provider, WithLogger(lg)) if err != nil { log.Print(err) return } } Glog and others If you need to use some other logger, such as glog, it is a matter of wrapping the calls to satisfy the logger.Interface (defined in the logger package), and then setting the Logger variable in slackdump.Options (see options.go), or using WithLogger option. FAQ Q: Do I need to create a Slack application? A: No, you don't. Just run the application and EZ-Login 3000 will take care of the authentication or, alternatively, grab that token and cookie from the browser Slack session. See User Guide. Q: I'm getting \"invalid_auth\" error A: Go get the new Cookie from the browser and Token as well. Q: Slackdump takes a very long time to cache users A: Disable the user cache with -no-user-cache flag. Q: How to read the export file? A: For Slack Workspace Export, use SlackLogViewer which is extremely fast with an advanced search function, or slack export viewer which is a Python application and runs in a browser. For the generic dump files, see examples directory for some python and shell examples. Q: My Slack Workspace is on the Free plan. Can I get data older than 90-days? A: No, unfortunately you can't. Slack doesn't allow to export data older than 90 days for free workspaces, the API does not return any data before 90 days for workspaces on the Free plan.

Slackdump is even better than Slack's built-in export feature because it works without admin access and downloads attachments (e.g. images) in addition to messages. Exports can be browsed offline or loaded into Discord or Mattermost. After trying some other tools/scripts to export/archive Slack, I was amazed how well Slackdump worked. reply playingalong 11 hours agoparent> Slack will delete chats and files from free workspaces at end of August Are you referring to some deprecation by Slack which affects all free users? Or is it just your 90d retention period elapsing at the end of August? reply sixhobbits 10 hours agorootparenthttps://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/29414264463635-Up... Before slack kept the messages and didn't let you see them, but you had rhe option to unlock by paying in future. In August they will actually delete the data reply tayloramurphy 5 hours agoprevWe've used https://www.linen.dev/ to preserve history for our community. It's nice because it makes the contents searchable and let's us not worry about slack deleting data. reply xnx 4 hours agoparentNeat. I hadn't heard of that. There's also https://github.com/hfaran/slack-export-viewer which creates a very Slack-like interface to viewing archives. reply codetrotter 2 hours agoprevWell. I can’t use this at work. But what I really need is not even to export the messages themselves. I just want to save a list of all my channels, and the categories I’ve put them in. Anyone know a way to do that, using either just Slack itself, or some specific tool that is only about managing followed channels and the categories you’ve grouped them into? reply xnx 1 hour agoparentSlackdump also has a mode that exports a list of channels. Not sure about category groupings. You could also screenshot/OCR or copy and paste from the browser? reply paxys 2 hours agoparentprevShould be simple enough to find the data by opening the browser debugger and reloading Slack. reply codetrotter 1 hour agorootparentHm yeah true. I use the desktop app and sometimes I forget that it’s all Electron and that they also have a web version you can use in the browser as well. Thanks, that should be doable :) reply pibefision 5 hours agoprevAny idea of something like this but for Discord? reply rhyssullivan1 3 hours agoparentEither https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter or https://www.answeroverflow.com/about (I develop the second one) reply xnx 4 hours agoparentprevMaybe this: https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter reply Metacelsus 1 hour agoprevWhat a coincidence, I was just looking for a tool to do this. reply bartekpacia 3 hours agoprevWill it work when a server is free and the messages older than a few months are “hidden”? We have a free Slack server with 3k members, and buying some better license that’d let us export old messages is like $25k reply JasonSage 3 hours agoparentUp until recently at least, you could still download all messages on a free trial of a paid plan. reply paxys 2 hours agoparentprevIt's going to be a bit of a pain but what you can do is: 1. Disable all the users except one 2. Buy a license for the one remaining user 3. Export all your messages 4. Downgrade back to the free plan 5. Enable all the users again reply xnx 1 hour agorootparentAlmost this exact sequence worked for me. reply xnx 1 hour agoparentprevI think it might! Despite the Slack interface not showing messages older than 30 days, the official Slack export (even on the free tier) exports all messages. Slackdump might have similar access (didn't try). reply lambdaba 3 hours agoprevI always wonder why people write such projects with Go, I understand the performance benefits but I don't see it in this use case, and it's such a verbose language. reply JasonSage 3 hours agoparentThere’s a ton of acceptable reasons for it, and many of them have nothing to do with the relative fitness of Go to the task. A couple easy-to-reach-for examples are: the author could write this faster in Go than another language, because of their familiarity; or the author deliberately wrote it in a language to learn something new or try something. reply lambdaba 2 hours agorootparentI understand, it's just that I often see projects that are a natural fit for a scripting language written in Go, specifically, it's rarer with Rust even. I wonder why that is. reply grogenaut 1 hour agorootparentTo me go is a scripting language. Bash doesnt have great concurrency or type checking. When I was pulling some discord and slack it got real slow with curl and unmanageable with bash. Few hours later i was done with it in go and it was super fast I often have to do similar at work where you could just bulk process say ALB access logs with bash into some simple stats, And it would work but in the time it took for bash to complete which was about 7 days per days of logs on the services that I was working on I was able to write go code that did it in a under 30 minutes for a day of logs. I was also able to easily make it where it output to parquet instead and then started pulling the data up in Jupiter notebooks and being able to get every stat I ever wanted as opposed to chucking away 99% of the data and bash. That was also able to keep my computer mostly active and maximizing bandwidth and CPU. And if it's in go it's entirely portable cross-platform and I can build a compiler binary I can just hand the people to do the same thing. Scripting languages require a lot of environment set up and libraries and specifics that are not always true on other people's machines. And finally as the other person said I'm actually just good at go so why would I learn bash or another scripting language that's actually not as good for this solution space reply bilkow 1 hour agorootparentprevI think there's a lot of personal preference here, but for me \"projects that are a natural fit for a scripting language\" would be one-off 100-line scripts. I think for a CLI tool such as this with 38 kloc and used by others, I'd personally be more productive using a strongly typed language (such as Rust) as the compiler will catch many mistakes before I run it. But as I said, there's a lot of personal preference... I don't know how much that also applies to Go and you definitely could write this in Python if you wanted to (although I'd use mypy for maintainability). I also agree with your parent, familiarity and just liking to use the language are big factors when choosing a language, even more for side projects. reply cedws 1 hour agoparentprevScripts are more difficult to distribute to end users. reply vasco 10 hours agoprevSo if you can do this, could you \"reverse\" it when you're done dumping messages and use API to repost them all to slack again? This way you could cycle channels every expirationperiod and have infinite slack retention on a free plan. Only downside is each cycle gets larger as it has (N+1)*90 days worth of data. reply jclulow 10 hours agoparentSurely you could just... Use a different chat system? reply cassianoleal 9 hours agorootparentThe problem is, as always, that the value people take out of these systems is not inherent to the system itself but rather to the people on it. Moving 100s of people out of a certain Slack server to a different chat system may prove untenable or outright impossible. Doing that for a few Slack servers, especially ones where you're just another regular user, would likely be a full-time job, and a fool's errand at that. reply muixoozie 10 hours agorootparentprevFor real.. Zulip exists reply Hamuko 10 hours agorootparentSo does IRC. 36 years and counting. reply chx 9 hours agorootparentLet me generalize this thread because it was archetypical. #1: Much used, leading service went down the enshittification route. If we did this extremely convoluted geeky hack everything would be back to normal (it wouldn't). #2: Let's use another service. #3 and on: yes, here are other services which no one aside from statistical error uses. Sigh. Remember when people suggested to use Lemmy instead of Reddit? You might ask, what's the point of this comment. Well, it's to get people to read https://pluralistic.net/ more and for the geeks to start unionizing before it's too late (it already is). reply Flop7331 3 hours agorootparentI used to really dislike Cory Doctorow back in the BoingBoing days, but he's really putting out some great stuff lately. I'm not sure which of us changed. Particularly nice that the top article right now is a takedown of a company that screwed me over, so I might also be biased. reply serhack_ 9 hours agoprevI would remind all the people to recompile the build themself, before downloading a random binary and allowing it to access the Slack workspace. But, very interesting project! reply wslh 8 hours agoprev [–] It is always good to highlight that Slack does not enable to download private messages (except in more expensive data compliance plans). If you want to to this on an organization you need to impersonate every account from your domain(s). reply xnx 4 hours agoparent [–] So true. Slackdump is nice in that it at least allows you to download any conversation you've been a part of. reply Consider applying for YC's first-ever Fall batch! Applications are open till Aug 27.
