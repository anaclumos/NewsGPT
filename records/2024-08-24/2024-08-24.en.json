    "originBody": "Did you lose your AirPods? 2024-08-23 A friend found some AirPods on the ground and tapped them to his phone, revealing only the serial number and the last four digits of the owner's number. He turned to me for help. All Out Could I really brute-force spam all phone numbers ending in 1234 and find the right owner? This seemed a bit impractical, so I had to think of ways to whittle the number down to something more manageable. Area Code I started with the assumption that the owner lived near me in the Portland metropolitan area. With that, I restricted the search to our local area code*. Sure, they could be from out of town, but hey, let's give it a shot. 999 numbers is a manageable list, but I wanted to trim the number a bit more. Sure, sending a thousand SMS messages isn't much to a determined spammer, but I didn't want to be that noisy or piss off Twilio. Possible matches: 999 Prefixes Next, I narrowed it down by central office code (commonly called prefix) (those three digits after the area code). Most of Portland’s are assigned, but only 26% to wireless carriers. Also, 000-199 are reserved codes that aren't available for telcos. I lied earlier, sorry. Possible matches: 232 iMessage Lookup API It's a safe bet that the owner has an iPhone with iMessage turned on. We can use this assumption to narrow down the list further by filtering out any non-iMessage phone numbers. I ran a check using this API. (The API is probably used for shady stuff, but my intentions were pure.) Total matches: 84 Did you lose your AirPods? With the list whittled down, I avoided Twilio entirely by using a script on my MacBook to send iMessages in bulk. Now we wait. 1 Match Bingo! I found the owner, relayed the contact info to my friend, and the AirPods were returned to the right ears. Notes Yes, Find My exists, but they had no idea how to use it. Plus, where's the fun in that? I did have to field a few messages from confused people, but I got really lucky and hit in less than 10 messages. We confirmed that the AirPods paired, which wouldn't be possible if they didn't belong to them. *Portland has two area codes, but I only had to try one. Luck, right? 355",

(alexyancey.com)977 points by RockRobotRock 19 hours agohidepastfavorite357 comments helipad 17 hours agoI left my AirPods Pro at a school sports field an hour away, and I didn't realize until the next morning after it been raining heavily. I gave them up for lost and needed headphones for work – so ordered some from Apple with same day delivery. A week later, I got a Find My notification that they had been spotted – at the same sports field. I figured what the hell, put on a podcast and drove the hour to see if I could find them. Worst case scenario, a couple of hours of driving. Using Find My and the directional feature points you in the right direction to within feet, I found them in the tall grass. The case had been perfectly watertight, and they'd barely lost a percent of power in a week. Remarkable really all round. reply conradev 10 minutes agoparentI used to bike from SF to Apple in Cupertino once a week. One week, I dropped my AirPods case on the ride and only when I got to work did I realize I was missing an AirPod. The next week, I stopped right around where I dropped the case and I found it, working just fine. I love that when you drop the case, the AirPods scatter into the farthest reaches of wherever you are – favorite feature reply furyofantares 3 hours agoparentprevI lost two sets in the snow at my mom's house. Where she lives the snow sticks around for 4 or 5 months. They would have been near the top of a few feet of snow where we were making snow angels and generally frolicking, and then covered up by additional snowfall. We found them once it melted. They both work fine. reply thekevan 3 hours agoparentprevI accidentally put mine through the washing machine. The aftermarket case I had them in died but the Airpods themselves survived just fine. That was 2 years ago and I still use them every day. reply hilux 16 hours agoparentprevMine lose 20-30% sitting in their case overnight. It's very annoying. You ARE lucky! reply gandalfgreybeer 16 hours agorootparentThat definitely isn’t normal. My guess is you need to clean the contacts in the AirPods. They might be in the case but it’s still pairing or trying to pair. Shouldn’t drain that much, especially overnight. reply csomar 11 hours agorootparentIt's an iOS bug. It happens now and then for me, and when it happens it drains all the battery juice. Still no fix to this date. reply jmaker 10 hours agorootparentMy Apple Watch regularly gets burning hot and drains the battery. Sometimes overnight, sometimes during the day. Very annoying. Reset several times, Apple Care was of no help, no fix to this date either. Only way to alleviate is to reboot the Watch. reply KennyBlanken 52 minutes agorootparentIt's defective. They need to fix it or replace it. reply szundi 9 hours agorootparentprevThis is since the existence of software and is going to stay with us until most people is ok to have 1/3rd of the features for the same kind of money. This will never happen, so bugs are here to stay. reply pessimizer 7 hours agorootparentThe fact that software is buggy is not the customer's fault any more than food poisoning is the fault of people who eat too much. reply rapind 3 hours agorootparentIt’s not the individuals fault on their own, but the market absolutely reflects societies tolerance of bugs and crashes.

This is like blaming people for not locking their door after they’ve been robbed. Yeah, they should have locked their door. But the person who actually did wrong is the person who robbed them. Blaming somebody for not taking extra steps to reduce the chances of something happening to them that is ultimately the fault of another party is not right. reply RHSeeger 3 hours agorootparentI don't agree with this at all. It is possible to both be in the wrong _and_ not be the villain. If I am dressed to the 9s, wearing expensive jewelry, carrying a lot of money.... and then I want down dark alleys.... and I get mugged; I am not the bad guy, the mugger is. But I'm also partially to blame, because I knowingly took actions that increased the likelihood of me being mugged. Our society has elements that will harm us. It is up to us to take action to reduce the likelihood of that happening. reply ensignavenger 2 hours agorootparentprevPointing out that there are ways to reduce risk of something bad happening does not excuse the fault of a perpetrator. Neither is it victim blaming. This is particularly true when having a bad thing happen to you could occur without any individual acting intentionally, such as is the case with food poisoning. reply DavideNL 6 hours agorootparentprev> \"It's an iOS bug\" How did you determine it's an iOS bug? reply bratwurst3000 10 hours agorootparentprevcould you link the bugreport or sth pls. apple has such weird bugs. on my iphone if i set an alarm and late at night i decide to tell siri to put another alarm she deletes the first one. did miss some flights because of that. and sometimes it doesnt ring at all. have a analog alarm for that now. reply cromka 10 hours agorootparentApple doesn’t do public bug reports reply jsjohnst 7 hours agorootparentApple officially doesn’t, but the community does… http://www.openradar.me/ reply ornornor 9 hours agorootparentprevApple doesn’t really care about bugs.

I long ago lost the brassiere that came with my AirPods Max (not really lost, I just can’t be arsed to dig it out of where I think it is) and they’ll drain themselves fairly quickly just trying to throw out stray connections to any of the five or so devices they can connect to unless I make a point of disconnecting them. AirPods Pro exhibit the same exact symptoms when the contact inside the case needs to be cleaned. reply lostlogin 12 hours agorootparentI can’t work this out.

Bunch of companies make after market cases/covers, you should get one of them at least. reply nxicvyvy 13 hours agorootparentprevMy airpods need a small piece of tissue in the top on one side or they don't charge.

Unless Person B also tells you that in general their air pods only last 30 minutes playing music. As stated, their percentage of power level fall vs person A is 2000% more being generous (person A said a week, not a night). If it was because of the battery, the air pods would also last way way way less playing music. reply asveikau 14 hours agorootparentExcept when lithium batteries get old they start to lose double digit percentages in a couple hours. My experience anyway. reply samstave 15 hours agorootparentprevYou're right. Its definitely the Person. reply Uptrenda 11 hours agorootparentprevI love the airpods but ah... they dont play well with any kind of metal work. If you do metal work with a file the shavings get everywhere and once they stick to the magnet its almost impossible to get them out. I guess this is a very unusual edge case though but thought id post it. lmao. reply eszed 1 hour agorootparentI use tape, or bluetack. Bluetack is easiest for the external connectors, but a wodge of tape, properly manipulated, can get the internal ones.

For some reason, my AirPods silently connect to my iPhone while they're in their case and both devices are asleep. Why they do this, I have no clue. Just quality 2020s Apple programming. Anyways, there's an easy solution: go into the settings app (not the drop down menu) and turn off Bluetooth on your phone/ipad when you don't need it. Your AirPods will no longer randomly drain at night. Neither will your Apple Pencil, if you have one of those. You'll find a lot of comments on Apple support forums/reddit/etc saying it's impossible for it to be Bluetooth and that you should never turn it off for any reason because it's crazy. People for some reason are very assertive about that. But they're wrong. I now make a habit of only turning Bluetooth on precisely when I need it and immediately turn it off afterwards and now nothing gets drained needlessly. Now the only AirPods bug that drives me insane is the volume randomly shooting up halfway to max randomly sometimes when I connect to my computer, but I made a script to somewhat fix it. reply deeth_starr_v 4 hours agorootparentCan’t you just turn off Bluetooth easily via Control Center? Top left Bluetooth symbol reply foundddit 3 hours agorootparentThat doesn't turn Bluetooth off. It's deceptive. It simply \"disconnects\" it, but it'll still connect at a random point in the future. It also doesn't really disconnect it since it'll still detect devices and burn away your battery life. And I experimented with it countless times over a couple years. That's why I said you need to do it through settings directly. Otherwise it won't do anything. reply iwontberude 2 hours agorootparentYes it does. Once you tap that button Bluetooth will remain off. reply jq-r 1 hour agorootparentYes, but only until the next day. reply iwontberude 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is accurate. reply maronato 15 hours agorootparentprevThat is a lot, but I wonder if GP’s only decreased by 1% because their phone wasn’t close by. AirPods and their iPhones probably keep pinging each other to maintain the Bluetooth connection, which must have an effect on the battery. reply SllX 13 hours agorootparentOnly when you pull them out of the case. Otherwise they just stay asleep. When I replaced my Powerbeats Pro (same fundamental tech as any AirPods) with AirPods Pro, I went about a year or so without touching the Powerbeats Pro and they just sat in one spot not too far from anything they could connect to since I never unpaired them from anything. I pulled them out a year later, and the Beats themselves were still fully charged and I think the case was still about 70%. Couldn’t tell you what I had left the case at though. reply gcanyon 8 hours agorootparentprevMine sometimes don't charge in the case, and can either end up with the case fully charged and the airpods fully drained, or if they charge/discharge through the night with the airpods at a random charge and the case somewhat drained. I seem to be the only person this happens to, but the won't-charge-in-the-case problem was so bad with my original airpods pro that Apple ended up replacing the case, then the airpods pro and the case, over a very frustrating several months of back and forth. My new airpods pro were fine for maybe eight months, but the problem has started again. So far it's only once every few weeks, which I can live with. reply matwood 7 hours agorootparentIf you don’t know, make sure the light blinks when you drop each AirPod in. That will show it hit the contacts correctly. My APP 1s also had this issue way more often than my second gens. reply stingraycharles 10 hours agorootparentprevNot normal. Case takes months to deplete without usage for me. reply okdood64 14 hours agorootparentprevYours are broken somehow.

Donegan, L (1959) reply dyauspitr 13 hours agorootparentprevI find it funny that you consider a drastic difference like that a matter of luck. Clearly something isn’t right with your pods. reply mckn1ght 16 hours agorootparentprevSomething is wrong with them. I can use mine repeatedly over several days before finally needing to plug them in again. You should reach out to support. reply hilux 16 hours agorootparentI've googled it and tried all the recommended fixes. This is a frequent problem - only for some people. reply eek2121 15 hours agorootparentThe left earbud dying is a frequent problem. Sometimes I sometimes hear about the right, but usually the left. Even more rarely, both die frequently, which isn’t the real issue…they drain the case, right? (if not ignore the rest of this) Want me to blow your mind? The REASON for this is the case. Everyone always suggests cleaning, but that won’t help for the long term. I know because I have tried. I took a pair of tweezers and bent the metal contacts in the case outward. That was a year ago. I have not had a single issue since. Not one. I am willing to bet Apple brushed a manufacturing defect under the rug. YMMV and if your airpods are under warranty, consider that first, but after having the issue with first gen and second gen, I wasn’t about to deal with nonsense. reply j_bum 14 hours agorootparentGoing to give this a try tomorrow… fingers crossed. reply ornornor 9 hours agorootparentPlease remember to come back and update us after a couple of weeks! reply fragmede 14 hours agorootparentprev> I am willing to bet Apple brushed a manufacturing defect under the rug. What? that doesn't sound like Apple at all. They would never do that. I get butterflies just thinking that. reply samatman 3 hours agorootparentThe butterfly keyboard was a _design_ defect, and these are very different things. Apple went to great lengths (because telling Jony Ive 'no' was not an option) to try and tweak the design to function correctly in the real world, and failed. But they came out of the box functioning perfectly, and stayed that way until tiny specks of dust inevitably entered the picture. The entire saga was extremely boneheaded and after I took mine in for a replacement (which, I must say, was out of warranty and only cost me time) I vowed to never buy another MacBook which had that absurd keyboard. Fortunately I didn't have to, they went back to the proven design which is a true beast and just keeps chugging along for years without a single missed or repeated keystroke. But this is very different from shipping products with known _manufacturing_ defects, and then 'brushing it under the rug', presumably by not issuing a recall. I can't recall even the former happening with post-iPod era Apple products, let alone the latter. In this particular case, the most likely culprit is pushing the AirPod into the charging slot with enough force to bend down the contact. There isn't a way to manufacture a spring contact which isn't vulnerable to this, and the fix is easy if you have thin enough tweezers. If Apple shipped an edition of AirPods cases with bad contacts, which didn't charge out of the box, it's a safe bet that there would be press about it. Maybe there was, but if so, I missed the 635 comment HN thread about it. reply ornornor 9 hours agorootparentprev> butterflies I see what you did there. reply jbverschoor 13 hours agorootparentprevMine last not even 10 minutes after one year of use. Apple did nothing. So no more AirPods ever for me anymore reply mckn1ght 15 hours agorootparentprevHave you actually talked to Apple? They might just replace them. Is this the only pair that’s demonstrated this behavior, or has it been multiple units? reply ja27 48 minutes agoparentprevI saw someone on Twitter that left hers in a seatback on a flight. They'd show up on Find My every day for almost two months before they died. She talked to the airline multiple times about someone checking her seatback and several times they insisted they weren't there. Doubtful they ever checked at all but impressive battery life. reply ErigmolCt 1 hour agoparentprevIt’s rare to hear (for my ears) such a perfect outcome when it comes to lost tech reply carstenhag 50 minutes agorootparent(in germany) Friend took multiple trains, Ubahn, Bus. 5 Seconds after leaving the bus, he realized he had forgotten his backpack with id, laptop, etc. We were \"hunting\" busses for 2h but couldn't find it. He didn't have Find My set up on the mac. Filed police report etc. A week later he got mail saying the bag was found in a train in Augsburg. Which was the 2nd of 4 legs of the trips or something, and he was completely off where he lost it :D reply teekert 5 hours agoparentprevWow 1 percent in a week. I use mine every couple of days but they drain much faster. Perhaps yours decided, he, see no iPhone for a couple of hours let’s do some deep sleep. I’d love to have more control over then charge cycle like that. reply WanderPanda 5 hours agoparentprevI washed my Airpods in a washing machine once and they continued working normally for 6 months until the noise cancelling started to fail on one side. reply iaabtpbtpnn 16 hours agoparentprevMy AirPods went thru the washer and dryer in their case. No damage whatsoever! reply eek2121 15 hours agorootparentMy first gen pros didn’t survive. They still work, but have a high pitched wine. They were already out of warranty so I had to buy a new pair. I did not and will not complain. I have owned over a hundred pairs of headphones/earbuds in my lifetime and these things are the best, by FAR. However, don’t wash them. reply loloquwowndueo 5 hours agorootparentHoly crap, hundreds of pairs? What do you do with them? Run them through the washer just for fun? :) reply vel0city 4 hours agorootparentI probably haven't had hundreds yet, but probably more than one hundred. So many things used to come with cheap earbuds or headphones. A pocket radio. A portable CD player. A cheap MP3 player. A laptop. I've even had some small TVs come with headphones out of the box. So there's like 40+ sets I didn't even ask for over the years. Pretty much all immediate trash. Then there are the ones I bought in a pinch. Go on a trip, realize I didn't bring my headphones, swing by the store and get a cheap pair. Being a cheap pair, they often didn't last long. There's another dozen sets. Now the ones I actually wanted. Not all have replaceable cups or pads, so they'd often wear out after a few years. Or they were USB, and the circuitry started freaking out after a few years. On top of that I probably have different sets for different use cases. A pair for on the go. A pair for the computer. A pair for the HiFi system. A pair for the office. reply petre 14 hours agorootparentprev> They were already out of warranty so I had to buy a new pair.

They sounded \"off\" for a while, but returned to normal after a day of drying outside of the case. (I'm guessing that perhaps some water was blocking the microphones used for noise cancellation.) reply ravenstine 16 hours agorootparentprevI sometimes wear my airpods in the shower. Have gotten water in them often, but this never caused them to fail or be permanently damaged. reply pcf 6 hours agorootparentOut of curiosity – why do you wear them in the shower? Are they meant to withstand that? reply wodenokoto 9 hours agorootparentprevMine too. I tried them on and they played a loud, high pitch noise and haven’t dared touch them since. reply mrbungie 16 hours agorootparentprevMy airpods pro were totally destroyed in the washer/dryer, no idea why. Maybe it was because it was quite a lengthy washing cycle? reply adtac 15 hours agorootparentYou forgot to set the washing machine to \"Whites\" reply WWLink 15 hours agorootparentprevYea my brother has ruined 2 pairs of airpods in the washing machine. reply LeonB 14 hours agorootparentI wonder what the difference is? One (admittedly uninformed) hypothesis is that there might have been more detergent, and the failure was caused by detergent residue. If this was true, they could be (possibly) repaired by rinsing with fresh water to remove said residue and leaving to dry. (Lots of other possible hypotheses and confounding factors) reply cqqxo4zV46cp 15 hours agorootparentprevHeh. I wasn’t so lucky, and it was the morning of a flight. Never had more of a reason to pull the forget on the $15 2-hour delivery Apple offers in my area. reply agumonkey 5 hours agoparentprevWhat would happen if you lost only one? reply wafflemaker 5 hours agorootparentSlight chance of finding it if you notice it's missing fast enough. FindMy only finds the charger, not the headphones out of charger, but you can make it play a sound. You can buy a replacement for about 50% of the price of a new set (complete with charger case). reply Eric_WVGG 4 hours agorootparentThat’s not correct. One night I dropped my case as I crossed the street to my building. I grabbed it off the ground without paying attention, both buds had fallen out. In the morning, I picked up the case and noticed that it felt light. Find My reported both buds as having been seen outside on the sidewalk, one last seen four hours ago, the other six. I ran downstairs and outside to find them both smashed by car traffic. Another time a bud popped out of the case while passing through the TSA X-rays (yes, I have lousy luck with these). I was able to pinpoint the direction with the app and make it plays sounds, but the agents were unable to dig under the rollers and get it out. reply agumonkey 1 hour agorootparentprevIn my case I only own cheap aukey earbuds and so far I couldn't find any information about buying a single earbud reply joshiain 3 hours agoprevOn a recent holiday I'd just checked in to my hotel, went to unpack a bit and couldn't find my AirPods. I went to look at Find My to see where they were, but unfortunately I was in South Korea, and little did I know the location function in Find My doesn't work there. I thought it must have fallen out of my pocket while I was in the taxi, as I remembered having them as I got off the plane, and I have a bit of history with my earphones falling out of my pockets. I took a taxi from the taxi rank at the airport, so there was no record of who drove me like with Uber, but luckily I paid by card, and I could see what taxi company I used. I asked the staff at the hotel if they could help me call the taxi company to see if they could find out which driver dropped me off. They somehow managed to contact the driver, but he had not seen my AirPods. I went about the rest of my day while trying to convince myself that I didn't need a new pair. But while the location doesn't work with Find My, I could still play a sound through the case. So I would randomly hit it a few times hoping it was actually hidden away in my things. After losing all hope, later when I returned to my hotel room I found a note had been left for me saying the taxi driver had found my AirPods and turned them in to a local police station! Feeling excited I wouldn't have to go on the rest of my holiday without earphones, I happily made an hour long trip across the city to collect my AirPods, arriving just as the station was closing. reply hackernewds 5 minutes agoparentCool story reply radicality 17 hours agoprevSo you scripted sending the message to 84 different numbers, was that from your own personal iMessage account? I would be terrified of doing something like that, I imagine the account could get flagged for spam, and hearing the various tech horror stories, I wouldn’t be surprised if it could end up suspending your iCloud account with everything on it, blacklisting hardware devices linked to it, and who knows what else. reply lxgr 16 hours agoparentThis once happened to somebody I know! Their Apple ID somehow got banned from specifically, and only, iMessage and FaceTime; all other services like iCloud and the app store were working as usual. No idea why it happened, but Apple support was able to reset it on a phone call. My theory is that they'd kept a non-active SIM in their phone for a long time, and the phone had tried to repeatedly verify/link that phone number to their Apple ID (via challenge SMS, I believe), thereby exceeding some rate limit. Gotta love that such rate limits exist and do occasionally hit legitimate users, but at the same time, there are paid lookup-as-a-service APIs out there as mentioned in TFA... reply golergka 15 hours agorootparent> specifically, and only, iMessage and FaceTime; all other services like iCloud and the app store were working as usual Google should take note. reply tredre3 14 hours agorootparent> Apple support was able to reset it on a phone call. That too. reply whstl 12 hours agorootparentApple's phone support is insane, at least where I used it. High audio quality, no rush and no signs of them being an underpaid call center operator, always going the extra mile to help me. reply yungporko 6 hours agorootparentmust be location dependent. i've only ever had the standard 3rd world country script support employees, but they do tend to eventually transfer me to an irish guy who is allowed to speak freely after enough going around in circles. reply whstl 5 hours agorootparentI never used the support in an english-speaking country, so that might indeed explain my experience. reply danieldk 10 hours agorootparentprevYep, we had to contact Apple support maybe three times since we switched to Apple products in 2007. It was easy to get hold of them every time and they were very pleasant. The last time there was an issue with an Apple Care payment. I was forwarded to someone who I believe was actually in Apple’s Dutch accounting department (certainly not a help desk drone). They called me back to follow up and even after everything was sorted out to check if everything was looking good on my end. reply bbarnett 10 hours agorootparentprevWell you're paying for it, the app store fees alone make it worth while for Apple. I do wonder, with the changes slowly trickling down the pipe, will Apple's fees over then next few years slowly diminish? And if so, what of their support quality (which is financed via funds from app store fees)? reply Fnoord 9 hours agorootparentYep, you are paying for it. But with Google Android you pay with your privacy and time. And you get terrible support in return. I've been trying to get a paid game the past days for my kids, a game where you try use bolts to remove wooden planks. It only exists with IAP and/or ads. The ads are terrible and not tailored to children. Nor are all the dark patterns. And you can get rid of the ads. By paying you get rid of them!!.. for 24 hours. I'd rather pay via App Store or Google Play Store or Steam or whatever. Even a subscription for a month would've been better. reply nolist_policy 1 hour agorootparentFWIW there is the Google Play Pass which gets you 1000+ games without any ads or the need for additional in-app purchases. It can be shared with 5 family members too. reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparentprevDon't the Play Store and the App Store take exactly the same cut in most cases? reply whstl 10 hours agorootparentprevI don't think I have bought an App in the AppStore in years, so the only money they're getting for me was from the device I buy every 5 years or so. reply lxgr 1 hour agorootparentPhone support for devices usually ends a couple of months after the purchase date as far as I know, or has that changed? reply toast0 16 hours agoparentprevIt's been a long while, but I scripted iMessage a bit, and Apple has a pretty casual slide into unworking.

I didn’t have anyone’s cell number memorized other than my parents (555-555-1013) and his thanks to the numeric similarity. (We kept the same phone numbers when we moved away from home.) In this town, landline phones also all shared the same first six digits. Before cell phones got into the mix in the late 1990s, people could (and did) use 5 digits to represent phone numbers: 3-XXXX where the 3 referred to the first digit of the “exchange code”.

The slow death of long-distance billing, which also finds itself competing with the likes of FaceTime et. al., coupled with the highly-mobile nature of cell phones, have just made it a hassle to go through the process of changing your phone number for anything other than moving to another country (or a wicked discount). reply tialaramex 4 hours agorootparent> or a wicked discount Isn't that regulated? In many places the operators are required to let you take the number with you when you change provider to obtain a better/ cheaper service. Everybody's numbers in practice go via some LUT that's mapping a human \"telephone number\" which people dial to an actual service endpoint which might move (after all, cell phones already move, so this indirection was necessary to make that work) and so the rule only needs to say that there's some means by which company A gets to change the LUT for your phone instead of company B. reply kevincox 8 hours agoparentprevThis is the same in Canada. It isn't possible to distinguish landlines from cell phones by looking at the number. All numbers issued in an area have the same area code. The North American numberig plan looks like +1-AAA-BBB-CCCC Where AAA is the area code and BBB-CCCC is mostly meaningless. There are a few special area codes like 8xx for toll-free calls (the classic 1-800 numbers that businesses often use) but no prefix dedicated to mobile. When I moved to Ireland I thought it was weird that mobile numbers were identifiable. Especially since I had a Google voice number which looked like a landline which really confused people and websites. \"Trust me, just text it. It is fine.\" > Do you get a new number if you move I don't know about the US but this used to be common in Canada. Many providers would consider calls to different cities long distance and charge extra. So if you moved it was \"polite\" to get a new number so that people could call you for local rates. For example I went to university in Ottawa and changed my Toronto number so that people didn't have to pay long distance to call (even though it is the same province, about a 5h drive). However this isn't really the case anymore. In the US and mostly in Canada country-wide calling us pretty standard so most people's mobile number will reflect where they grew up, and they will carry that around for the rest of their lives. > and then change to a different provider? Usually not. You can ask your provider for a new number in a different city and they will issue it.

It isn't possible to distinguish landlines from cell phones by looking at the number. Atlantic Canada is small enough that there was a single area code for Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia up until a few years ago. Cellphones in the region tend to have their own CO code (first three digits of the phone number), so you can usually infer if it’s a number you can text or not. This is also the case for different regions of NS and PEI, so seeing a 902 number where the CO number is different from what you’re used to makes it seem “exotic”. This was also handy back in the day to know whether it was long distance or not.

Any idea if the premium was due to technical limitations or just to milk the customers? reply kevincox 6 hours agorootparentYou'd probably have to ask someone who worked in the phone industry at the time. I suspect that long-distance calls were legitimately quite expensive to provide at some point in the past, and the industry was happy to keep charging extra even as they reduced internal costs. Luckily this is mostly behind us, almost all providers offer Canada-wide as a standard feature. Canada+US is becoming the common default. Of course the problem with this system is that you need to worry about what plan the caller has. So if you want to be very sure that locals can call without paying long-distance rates it is still best to get a local number. But I think that in almost all cases the need for this has passed. reply tialaramex 4 hours agorootparent> I suspect that long-distance calls were legitimately quite expensive to provide at some point in the past From the outset, what actually costs money is the (telephone) network. But people were often reluctant to pay the true cost of access to the network at first - so for a long period the providers charged for calls. After all if the average person receives 100+ minutes of incoming calls per month, but is only willing to pay you $15 for the network access which you want $25 for, you can take their $15 and then charge 10 cents per minute for calls to get the same net revenue... In the US in particular the government regulators allowed operating companies to significantly overcharge for long distance in order to subsidise local calls. This creates market distortion which was judged worth it to facilitate widespread rollout of telephony.

And if so, how would the janitor even see the lockscreen, wouldn't they have to hit the power button to see it (I presume the screen is off by default?). And why was the janitor even in the apartment? And presumably without the thief in their apartment?

Once charged they paired to my iphone with no indication of a previous owner, besides the device name of John’s AirPods or whatever. I tried briefly (not as hard as the author) to figure out who they belonged to but had no luck. I called Apple support and gave the serial number, but they told me there wasn’t anything they could do if the owner did not mark them as lost via the Bluetooth settings page.

The hardware failed over time and now the noise-cancellation feature causes audio to be very scratchy, making them awful for listening to music. I think mine lasted a little over a year of occasional use. I went to an Apple store to see if I could get them replaced since I knew there was a recall on one version. They refused since mine was the version that came out after the recalled version. That soured me on AirPods.

The microphone on the AirPods died after about 18 months of use, but they otherwise still work perfectly (perhaps with slightly degraded, but still quite serviceable, battery life), and have survived a wide range of abuse (multiple trips through the washing machine, repeated drops onto pavement, in some cases from a bicycle moving at decent speed, etc). The Pros, on the other hand, in spite of me generally being quite careful with them (in contrast to the basic AirPods) had their noise canceling crap out at about the 2 year mark, and currently are slightly louder in one ear than the other (but the microphone still works, so they remain in service). So, overall, I think I’ve had a similar experience to you with the Pros, but have been quite impressed with the non-Pro model. reply minimaxir 18 hours agoparentprevThat was a known issue with the 1st-gen AirPods Pro (Apple had a 3 year replacement program for them) but I've heard fewer issues with the 2nd-gen. reply kjkjadksj 15 hours agoparentprevEmbarrassing really when you consider the wider market.

I'm on my 4th pair of Airpod Pros. One pair I got replaced by Apple due to a known problem in the Pro 1st gen, the other two both failed right outside warranty. The noise cancellation is the weak part. The microphone or related hardware breaks and then you get all kinds of plops and squeals unless you turn noise cancellation off. Somehow they tend to do that about 3 to 6 months after warranty... reply csomar 11 hours agoparentprevI have the Airpods Pro 2nd Gen, and after 2 years they are as good as useless.

(I didn't study Greek long enough to get all the way through the verb paradigm and I haven't used it very regularly since then.) So yeah, I don't get the claim that nobody could play this quiz. I think I have friends who would get all of them right offhand. It's no more complicated than knowing the difference between \"hablo\", \"hablaré\", \"hablé\", \"hablaba\", \"hablado\", and \"hablando\" in Spanish, except that fewer people study ancient Greek than modern Spanish (and the older Indo-European languages do more stem-mutation between tenses, so it can be a bit more effort to memorize). The worst part of this format is probably that if you did \"quiz english greek\" it wouldn't accept any form of accent or breathing marks, even though these are also standardized in beta code and some people would probably try to type them, like \"e)luon\" to show that there's no /h/ sound at the beginning of that word. And I don't think typing beta code in between dollar signs is a very common convention today, but the quiz would require it; you can't just type \"luw\", you have to type \"$luw$\". reply anthk 9 hours agorootparentSpanish has rules for verbs ending with -ar,-er- and -ir save for few exceptions. Still, RAE should have accepted \"conducí\" as \"conduje\" long ago (and the rest of declinations/verbs such as traducir, reducir...) IDK about Greek. If we are using two valid ending forms of Subjunctive (-era/-ese) since forever, IDK why couldn't we set these irregular verbs back to regularity. reply schoen 8 hours agorootparentGreek has verbs with different \"thematic vowels\", which are sort of like the Spanish conjugations, but not exactly the same thing (although I think both varieties of verb groupings probably have a distantly shared origin in Indo-European). The Spanish conjugations -ar, -er, and -ir derive from Latin conjugations, which are usually analyzed as having four different regular conjugation patterns (there are long and short e, giving -ēre and -ere, in addition to -āre and -īre), although one can choose to make additional distinctions. Generally older Indo-European languages have more complex morphology than newer ones, including more paradigms and more irregular forms. Ancient Greek verbs are definitely morphologically more complex than modern Spanish verbs. reply nescioquid 21 hours agorootparentprevI would guess most people interested in the quiz would be familiar with betacode (which this looks like, sans diacritics). edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Code reply buescher 20 hours agorootparent\"Beta Code was developed by David W.

    "originBody": "That time Reddit banned me for developing an app Published on August 24, 2024 #reddit #app #geddit Reddit did me dirty. I did them too. This is the story of how I got a permanent ban from Reddit for developing a non-commercial open-source client called Geddit. How it all started Around June 2023 Reddit announced their new API pricing, I mean it’s kinda wrong to say “new API pricing” because until that time it was all free to use the API. According to them, the pricing they’ve planned was “$12,000 per 50 million API requests”, which meant a death sentence for all the non-commercial apps and bots that were used by millions of users. If you think that’s not a big deal, keep reading… You must have heard of the popular Reddit client Apollo, developed by Christian Selig, who has also other notable apps like Juno, a YouTube app for Apple Vision Pro. If memory serves right, it was also on the front page of Hacker News. Christian shared a post on Reddit stating that “Apollo would have to pay Reddit $20 million per year to keep running as-is”. Cricket sounds… I know. Geddit I was a Reddit user for a long time and I had lots of bots running on Reddit, just for fun. Upon hearing the news, being an ambitious and naive developer in my third year at university, I decided to inspect the Reddit API to see what I could do. Then I’ve discovered that you could get the whole page in JSON format by adding .json to the end of the URL. That was my big aha moment. In a couple days I’ve put together a simple wrapper for the Reddit API as a small Javascript library and named it Geddit, which I thought was a funny name. I’ve shared it on GitHub and I still think it’s working today. With this library, you could view Reddit as a read-only user, with all the features you’d expect from a Reddit client with anonymous browsing. The thing is, you didn’t need to authenticate to use it, which was a way to develop further apps without needing to pay Reddit. And then, I came across capacitor and ionic framework, which were libraries that allowed you to develop native mobile apps in HTML, CSS and Javascript. It was like Electron but for mobile. And things started to get interesting. The app Geddit An open-source, Reddit client for Android without using the public JSON feed This little fella came around the following month as an Android app. It was just a simple JSON parser actually, but it worked well as a Reddit client. People started using it, and wrote to me about it. And it also got me going to see how it was mentioned on the internet. Hacker News Android Police Reddit YouTube I know it’s not a big number but there are over 25k downloads solely from the GitHub Releases page to this day, without counting the F-Droid downloads (can’t see the stats). End of the road I’ve released several versions and added some styling based on the Material Design guidelines. Then I’ve published it on the F-Droid store, which was something I’ve never done before. It was a great experience to see your app on a store, even if it was a small one. And then, I’ve received an e-mail from Reddit. To be honest, I was expecting it. There were some misunderstandings in the email. This wasn’t a commercial product, nor I was doing some kind of explotiation to use the same API without restrictions. This was just the way how the Reddit website worked if you didn’t have an account. I’ve replied to the email in the most respectful way I could. I’ve decided to pause the development of the app until I received a response from Reddit, which I never did. So, you might as well say that this project is dead, although it’s still working today. Thanks for the fun, Geddit. kaangiray26 P.S. God, I miss the old Reddit. I should start my own text-only social media platform based on Markdown. Maybe I'll call it \"Markit\", and demand $30k per year for the API. Maybe I should just \"forgetaboutit\"... Webmentions",

I'd discover new interesting subs, read random posts and comments. The frontpage was somewhat interesting too, but now it feels like a bot fest and propaganda machine. I still use Reddit but way less than I used to before, and I no longer use it for fun but just to read niche tech subs. I refuse to use the official mobile app. I've always used Baconreader and then Relay on Android. Relay survived the API changes and adopted a subscription model. But thanks to Revanced I was able to patch an old version of Relay to use my own API key for free. reply maipen 9 hours agoparent> but now it feels like a bot fest and propaganda machine. Pretty much sums up every popular social media platform these days. HN is still a good place to learn about whats going on in the tech world and what not because it's simple and filters out alot of \"brainrot\", although there is an increasing number of comments that soley react at the headline. Reddit has become like meta, you either have an account or your user experience will be so horrible that you won't use it. X simply doesn't allow you to use it, atleast it doesn't pretend. I think we need more simple websites again, but I am not sure about the incentive structure. reply hi-v-rocknroll 9 hours agorootparentWell, reddit became worse than that ~10 years ago because of the inconsistent, absurd, immature unreasonableness of a sizable fraction of mods who added suck and subtracted cool from the world. Maybe this is a pattern common to most all group-oriented social media platforms where community mods skew towards being drama-oriented, elitist, and/or crazy because no one else wants the job and so, like policing, it attracts certain personality disorder-like individuals. reply badsectoracula 9 hours agorootparent> Maybe this is a pattern common to most all group-oriented social media Channel operator drama was a major thing with IRC back when it was popular (sometimes ending to like channel splits or even whole netsplits if the people involved were related to the server operators, bot/flood wars, etc), so yeah, there isn't anything specific to Reddit about it. I wasn't part of it but i am pretty sure you'd see the same patterns in Usenet back when that was popular (and despite the romantization, i somehow doubt that Usenet was all roses before the \"Eternal September\"). reply subsection1h 6 hours agorootparent> despite the romantization, i somehow doubt that Usenet was all roses before the \"Eternal September\" Usenet was the best discussion platform I've ever used.

I'm not aware of any. reply GrantSolar 3 hours agorootparentThese are criticisms that are leveraged against stack overflow all the time. I'm more lenient on SO's stance because it at least wants (or claims to) to be a repository for truth, rather then filtering out questions because of \"lol noob\" reply nonlogical 4 hours agorootparentprevI am sure places like this have their right to exist, and they would probably be a great place to consume… without actively participating. By nature of being strict and exclusionary they will essentially tend towards becoming a relatively small exclusive club perhaps slightly bordering on being an echo chamber. Whether you consider that a bad thing or good, I am not making a judgement call here. Also the cycle/churn of software is so quick nowadays that manuals are often written as a second or third thought for majority of the projects. So I can not really blame folks for just directly probing for tribal knowledge. reply theamk 4 hours agorootparentprevNote killfiles were per-user (they could be shared, but this was optional and required specific clients), so those blocked people were still visible for non-regulars. The result was that newsgroups were very different for insiders vs outsiders: insiders saw nice clean message feed, outsiders saw tons of low-content messages with no replies and rare nugget of interesting info. This was one of the big reasons why Usenet died for me: too much spam and useless messages, as there is no group-wide authority (and no, cancel bots never seemed to work) Today, if you want heavily moderated group, there is plenty - they are simply scattered on the web. Many of them are phpbb-style forums, some discords and slacks (ugh...). reply vonunov 6 hours agorootparentprevWell, they were kind of snippy with me on the FreeBSD forum some years ago when they felt like I hadn't done enough on my end, so there's that reply badsectoracula 4 hours agorootparentprev> It was awesome.

Most people are stupid and the only way to have something nice is to gatekeep. Every single time any community grows too large it becomes shit. reply rightbyte 4 hours agorootparentI don't think that the newcomers are necessarely worse, but that you mainly lose the ability to know most users by name when the number grow too big. reply Etheryte 9 hours agorootparentprevI feel like this is another example of a problem that could be easily solved if we had integrated, anonymous and frictionless payments on the web. For example, imagine a Reddit clone, but every comment you want to post costs one cent. For a regular user it takes a while to build up even a hundred comments, meanwhile for a spammer, this could quickly become costly. The hurdle of course is that no one wants to put their credit card details into a bunch of random sites, or nearly any site for that matter. If we had anonymous payments integrated into our browsers, it would be very straightforward though, click a button and you give a site a dollar and you're good for a while. This would generalize and improve many other sides of the web as well, from sponsoring open source projects to creators. Removing the payment friction could help improve many things online, but I don't think I've ever seen a feasible, realistic path proposed towards that. reply latexr 9 hours agorootparent> imagine a Reddit clone, but every comment you want to post costs one cent. For a regular user it takes a while to build up even a hundred comments, meanwhile for a spammer, this could quickly become costly. That site wouldn’t have any spam, true. Though not because of the cost, but because it wouldn’t have any users to make it worth spamming. No one wants to pay per message. Everybody would be too nervous and quadruple-thinking “is this message worth a cent?” Once in a blue moon someone would post, get no reply, and be even more unlikely to post next. And yes, yes, not literally everyone, but enough that it becomes a rounding error. reply wildrhythms 6 hours agorootparent>but every comment you want to post costs one cent So the wealthiest people get to spread the most propaganda? reply kelseyfrog 4 hours agorootparentYou could take a page out of quadratic voting and scale costs nonlinearly. Then spamming would be disproportionately costly. This raises some interesting problems like, why not simply create multiple accounts, which have a different tradeoff calculus. reply carlosjobim 4 hours agorootparentprevI think you have to have assets worth significantly more than one cent in order to count yourself among the wealthiest. Just my two cents. reply concordDance 7 hours agorootparentprev> Everybody would be too nervous and quadruple-thinking “is this message worth a cent?\" I think that's well below the threshold people would care. The problem is that $0.01 is too low, it'd be well worth spending to advertise or propagandize. For context, USA presidential elections will spend billions, they could make ten billion posts for a fraction of their war chest. reply latexr 7 hours agorootparent> I think that's well below the threshold people would care. People don’t even pay 0.99$ for apps they use all day every day, opting instead to suffer through ads and have their batteries drained. There’s no chance they’d pay 0.01$ per message. For the vast majority, there are two price points: free and not free. The psychological difference between free and 0.01$ is magnitudes larger than the difference between 0.01$ and 1$. reply Grimburger 9 hours agorootparentprev> every comment you want to post costs one cent People were saying this about email 20+ years ago.

You have zero issues with spam and abuse because you have a small user base, not because of the fee. Twitter has TONS of paid accounts for spam. reply rglullis 6 hours agorootparentFirst: citation needed in spammers using paid accounts. Why would they pay to spam, go through credit card fraud detection and so on when a free account is (by definition) zero cost? Mind you, I am talking about pure spam and not crazy sophisticated phishing scams. Those certainly exist in Twitter. Second: scale. Twitter has millions of users, it is not profitable and is suing advertisers in a desperate attempt to justify its lack of revenue. Let's just say that a miracle happens and I get my dream number of paid accounts (10k at $29/year). The operation would be profitable enough to pay myself more than I ever made in any job and still contribute back to the downstream projects. I could literally close registrations on my service, or start a different vetting process. reply themoonisachees 6 hours agorootparentAll the accounts seen on the popular \"ignore previous instructions\" screenshots have paid for twitter. There's no reason to believe that these bots don't operate at scale and don't all spend $8 a month. On top of that, they are effectively paying per word to post through paying for tokens. This does not stop them. reply rglullis 5 hours agorootparentBots being paid by a state that is a misinformation campaign is not the same as spam. Assuming the Fediverse was as popular as Twitter/FB, they could simply run their own instances, no need to pay for access through any specific server. reply davidcbc 3 hours agorootparentBots spamming misinformation isn't spam, gotcha. Really moving the goalposts there reply rglullis 3 hours agorootparentI meant spam as shorthand for \"bulk send of messages of similar content\". Cheap to produce and to send. If bots paid by some government count as spam, then we should also say the same about sponsored content or PR releases. Anyway, my point is that charging for access to a network where access is already open is good enough for a filter to avoid spam originating from your node. Spammers are not going to be interested in paying $29/year to be able to send posts via Mastodon when they can just create a bunch of accounts on servers with open registrations or simply running their own botnet. reply Kye 6 hours agorootparentprevSpam is not just unsolicited commercial messages.

The psychology is already there, \"all\" that's required a snowball to start adoption in the online media space. reply ben_w 9 hours agorootparentprevI doubt that payments of any kind will help much. From a purely theoretical level, there's a very broad range of incomes worldwide, so any price point you use to keep spammers out makes it unaffordable to the average person in many nations, and varying pricing by nation just means the spammers pretend to be from the cheapest nation(s). We also have a demonstration of payment-based messaging systems in that price range with SMS and voice calls, which still get junk.

Also it tends to be made illegal for obvious reasons (even if in practice, everyone but the most careful user eventually gets identified by their IP, the logs of which Web servers are legally obligated to keep in most states). Otherwise, if you actually meant pseudonymous payments, well, Flattr actually tried to do it.

It’s a recruiting tool for a major Silicon Valley VC firm. Brainrot isn’t going to attract as much of the talent or stimulate the ideas they’d want to fund, so HN has been good at resisting brainrot. This is my own analysis, I don’t have a source for it. The internet has always had nice discussion forums that were labors of love of generous people. In the case of HN, the generous person running the forum is actually a company managing billions of dollars. In the absence of a better funding model for the internet, maybe that’s the solution: altruistic billionaires finance more discussion forums that don’t exist to be profitable, at least not directly. The exponential growth required of publicly traded social media companies drives different motives in moderating and promoting the discussions. reply immibis 7 hours agorootparentThey don't have to be billionaires, but they do have to be altruistic.

A certain person tried that, but HN has given them nothing but hate over it. If there’s a specific idea you or others had in mind that was different, I haven’t seen any serious proposals or roadmaps posted. I’d love to see it though, I’d rather things be more decentralized without the contemporary gatekeeping that comes with it. Also I’m not sure what you had in mind for altruistic. There’s a difference between financing people’s nostalgia fetishes and financing the repairing of society, but either could be squeezed into the definition. reply dale_glass 7 hours agorootparentYou mean Twitter? It's pretty much opposite from what I want from a platform. What I want is more or less Mastodon. A feed ordered by date, a complete lack of algorithmic suggestion (unless maybe I explicitly ask for it), a complete lack of advertising, and stringent moderation that enforces things in my preferred direction. reply Nuzzerino 6 hours agorootparentI’m sure there’s some bozo GitHub repo out there that does exactly what you’re asking for. But you or someone needs to make a serious pitch with a viable roadmap and explain how it will add to society, and be prepared to tirelessly champion it as a movement, not just another shitty pet project. If it’s to service a nostalgia kick then that’s not going to be a big enough sell. Otherwise it needs to be a business, which is obviously not an option either. Xitter obviously made a lot of mistakes, but the appeal to society wasn’t one of them (the execution is another story), but that’s the only reason it is still around. There’s obviously a demand for it that isn’t being fulfilled. I’m not referring to “free speech”, I think that is the wrong message to focus on, though I do think big tech and Reddit had that wrong. Social media is responsible for the enshittification of society at large. It just takes a click to make someone an un-person at the slightest offense. Whether that be to exclude them from their social community with a block or ban, or expose something they said out of context. It’s not really a censorship issue as much as it is a self-censorship issue with the secondary effects that has on society as a whole. To put it more plainly: people are too afraid to express themselves, even under pseudonyms. There are exceptions but when they stand out it has a tendency to look weird, so it’s passively discouraged in that way as well. Even if you are allowed to do so, that doesn’t stop cancel culture from taking things you said or did out of context. You can’t have the old web culture back until that’s solved, and I don’t even know if that’s possible to do. So instead, we are stuck with gatekeepers and overzealous moderation (though the latter was a problem in the old days too). What a way to live, eh? reply epolanski 4 hours agoparentprevTheir apps and website both keep getting worse and worse. Reddit is one of those great examples were management and execs all feel like they need to show their impact and justify their salary and just make the platform worse. Bots and propaganda are literally everywhere. The platform keeps getting worse but I admit it is to some extent addictive. I am somewhat happy that HN is one of those places where politics are generally avoided. I am sick of people arguing about geopolitics and national politics like it was some fan battle while not even knowing their mayor candidates programs, hell many don't even know who their mayor is or what their city council is working on. This stems imho from the dead of traditional newspapers who were often local, in favor of internet media which is in its nature global. I swear most people in Italy know more about US politics than what's happening in their own backyard, completely backwards. reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 3 hours agorootparentI thought the site was getting worse because that's the natural life cycle of image hosts and Reddit decided to become an image host.

The final straw being the API debacle of course.

To be clear, amidst this, reddit was still growing. So from an Excel sheet management perspective, nothing seems wrong.

It can help people migrate away from Reddit by letting people sign up to a Lemmy instance [1] with their Reddit credentials and automatically subscribe them to the corresponding Lemmy alternative. The alternatives are crowdsourced. There is a \"flagship\" deployment at https://fediverser.network but if you want to fork it, you just need to run your instance and manage it as you see fit. The project got a (small) grant from NLNet a couple of months ago for me to work on having the functionality built-in into the Voyager client (a PWA Apollo clone).

I'm one of the 'silent' contingent on Reddit - frequently reads, but never posts. It is possible to use Mastodon or another ActivityPub application to interact with Lemmy (and vice-versa) to some extent, which will hopefully allow the two types of social networks to help each other grow. Would it be viable to add a setting for your own Fediverse account so that you could click on the communities to redirect them to your own server? For instance, if I search for /r/switzerland, there would be a button by the Fediverser suggestion of switzerland@feddit.ch to open it on my own Fediverse server - like the 'Take me home' button on the Mastodon web client. reply rglullis 6 hours agorootparentThanks!

They only worked towards “potential” profitability based on their huge user base as a signal towards potential investors. Before all this, before an IPO was considered an option, they actually did try to make the platform sustainable for a while. I can't remember the details, but buying gold (and getting some perks) you supported reddit. They actively promoted this and even had a counter that showcased how much you contributed to server costs and all that. This is also the only time I remember that reddit reported numbers in the black. They could easily have built further on this and increased income sustainably and slowly growing over time. But clearly at some point it was decided that this approach was not enough and that they needed more rapid growth and work towards an IPO. Which is the point where they massively scaled up their staff, started attracting investments and started working on the redesigned reddit. Which truly marked the beginning of the end. Not to say that things were perfect before that, far from it, the platform had enough issues back then as well. But there was a very distinct and clear point where things still could have turned around and reddit would be a radically different platform from what it is today. reply Ekaros 10 hours agoparentprevProbably combination of not actually being good at generating revenue. And also over hiring and wasting money on things beyond core-platform. You know all of the short lived \"events\" and features.

Subsequently on new accounts I’ve learned you simply can’t discuss Islamic extremism, Islamic colonialism and conquest, or the continuum of violence - which are all critical topics imo.

While these services are still relevant for you - and that is where the 'winning' starts, when their relevance drops below the level that makes it worth putting effort in fighting them - you can use proxies like libreddit for Reddit, Nitter for TwiXXer (it still works for reading single posts, no idea if it works for 'following' because I have never done that), Invidious for Youtube and (while you're at it) SearxNG for search engines. Once you have found or - better still - installed yourself some proxies of choice you can install a browser extension to automatically redirect any request for those sites to the proxies, two examples of such are Privacy Redirect and LibRedirect. The advantage of going the proxy route is that you only have to do this once after which you can access those sites from all your devices without needing to install separate apps. reply bezier-curve 9 hours agoparent [–] Libreddit is discontinued, but has been forked as redlib. reply hagbard_c 5 hours agorootparent [–] The original still works fine but good to hear there is a fork. reply Consider applying for YC's first-ever Fall batch!

    "commentBody": "Hot Page – a graphical site builder (hot.page)246 points by microflash 7 hours agohidepastfavorite73 comments WebBurnout 4 hours agoHey, I'm Tim and I created Hot Page. This is a long-time side project that I'm now bootstrapping with the help of a couple of friends. The idea is to take the convenience of a drag-and-drop editor (Squarespace, Wix, etc), but never lose the connection to the basic building blocks of web pages: HTML elements, CSS rules, etc. The advent of Web Components makes this a really powerful model. Although I'm of course pleasantly surprised to see this on the front page of HN, I was planning on waiting a few months to post it myself because we are working on some ways to make the editor much more powerful. We have a long roadmap of new features like: * more ways to edit CSS properties visually (without losing the 1:1 connection to the CSS generated) * inline CSS (style attribute) editor for elements that let's you use :hover and media queries * a library of code \"snippets\" that lives in the left panel along side the basic elements * tighter integration with web components * integrating VS code language servers for accurate auto completion everywhere * and a whole lot more. I'm a long time lurker on HN and have long loved the community here. All of your thoughts and feedback are greatly appreciated, especially on our marketing because that is proving to be a real challenge. AMA edit: roadmap reply AstroJetson 4 hours agoparentWell since microflash has jumped ahead, let me also jump in. https://fx.hot.page/ has some of the web components on it. While the slinky one is silly fun, the gallery one is very cool. Looks like it's light weight and easy to use. I was impressed by the annotated source code page where you explain in detail what is going on. While jumping, swirling, multicolored text is your mission, your forte is the documentation you've written. Nice job. reply WebBurnout 3 hours agorootparentWow, this comment just made the last 7 months of long hours totally worth it. You have understood and distilled the essence of this project so accurately. This is my first time launching something like this, so it's just a great feeling to know there are people on the other side of the screen who are getting it. reply spankalee 4 hours agoparentprevThe combination of web components + a visual app builder is a really compelling space. I'm working on something myself, and I love see more approaches our there! Your style is just obviously incredible. I hope some of that bleeds into your customers sites so there's more fun silly, but also real, things out there on the web. One thing I'm working on in parallel to a visual builder is a web components catalog and custom elements manifest validator. I hope this will help boost the set of quality web components available to tools like this, and that the catalog will be embeddable in them. Good luck! reply microflash 4 hours agoparentprevSorry for spoiling your planned launch on HN. I stumbled across it by accident (such are serendipities on web), thought it was cool and fat fingered it here. Looking forward to things coming in future. reply WebBurnout 3 hours agorootparentThanks for posting it! Obviously it's better to launch early and often but I'm much more of a programmer than a marketer and I was afraid it wouldn't get much traction.

Thanks for taking up the project (and reading my post!). I do webdev as a hobby so unfortunately I cannot contribute to the source code as I don't know enough PHP.

I tried to do it by setting an .htaccess rule for the folder I had them in, but wasn't able to get it to work. reply badsectoracula 5 hours agoparentprevI don't think it is very similar.

Probably completely fine for websites that want/need to look like every other website, like classic site builders, Squarespace etc. or internal business apps, forms and such, but for something that seems a bit targeted at letting people be creative, gen AI would do more harm than good I feel. reply jsjohnst 5 hours agorootparent> I don't think so at all, AI generated stuff usually has a certain soulless generic air to it that I don't think would suit this. I can’t believe I’m forced to defend myself here as I generally agree with the premise that adding AI doesn’t make something better (hence the smiley face in my original post), but FFS the FUD and hyperbole is simply in bad form. LOOK at the examples on the site. TRY the experience. Then come back and try and tell me you can’t generate endless amounts of images just like that what’s shown trivially with AI. You are entitled to your own opinion about AI, but that doesn’t make you factually right. reply __jonas 1 hour agorootparentYeah I'll be honest, I didn't look at the examples in great detail, from the visuals I thought this was more along the lines of hotglue.me, but now that I'm looking at them, some of the examples are indeed pretty generic and could be churned out by AI no problem, I don't doubt it. I think the disagreement is less on whether it's technically possible to use AI to help with this and more on whether it's a good idea to do that. reply scopeh 6 hours agorootparentprevHe does have a point though, not everything needs AI. reply rchaud 4 hours agorootparentprevNo thanks. Leave that slop to Squarespace/Wix. Those are publicly traded companies that will happily add AI stock photo 'integrations' to pump their share price.

JATO Dynamics’ data for 28 European markets revealed that a total of 1.03 million units were registered in the region, taking the number of year-to-date registrations to almost 7.9 million. Growth was particularly prominent in Poland (+19%), Portugal (+27%), and Slovakia (+12%). There were also slight increases in the UK (+3%), Italy (+5%), and Spain (+5%). In contrast, vehicle registrations decreased in Germany (-2%), France (-2%), Belgium (-7%), the Netherlands (-4%), and Ireland (-5%). For the last decade, SUVs have been increasing in popularity. In July they accounted for 54% of all vehicle registrations – a new record for the segment. Last month, 554,000 new SUVs were registered, a rise of 6% from July 2023. As a result, the year-to-date volume of SUVs reached 4.2 million units, an increase of 5%. While Toyota, BMW, Mercedes and Geely Group drove growth in the SUV segment, Volkswagen Group took poll position, leading the market by volume. 26% of SUVs registered were Volkswagen Group vehicles, followed by Hyundai-Kia with 12% and Stellantis with 11.5%. C-SUVs (compact models) saw the most demand, registering 210,600 units – a rise of 3%. Growth in the segment was also driven by B-SUVs (small models) with a volume increase of 14% – registering 204,300 units. E-SUVs (large models) registered 27,600 units, and F-SUVs (luxury models) registered 5,022 units, up by 23% and 32% respectively. The demand of D-SUVs (midsize SUVs) fell by 7% in July, recording 106,500 units. Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, commented: “Consumers in Europe now have access to more choice than ever before, and SUVs are a more comfortable and desirable option for many. This alongside the increasing availability of affordable models is helping consumers to make the switch from traditional segments to SUVs.” The demand for electric vehicles fell in July, with their market share decreasing from 14.6% in July 2023 to 13.5% last month. According to JATO’s data, 139,300 new electric cars were registered last month, down 6% from July 2023. Munoz, said: “The lack of clarity around the incentives for – and future of – EVs continues to present a barrier to consumers considering an EV. These factors, alongside the low residual value of EVs contributed to the decline seen in July.” BMW led the EV brand ranking last month, with a 35% year-on-year increase This was a strong performance compared to Tesla, which recorded a 16% year-on-year decline. While the Tesla Model Y and 3 both continue to dominate the year-to-date BEV ranking, they have recently lost ground. The Model Y is no longer Europe’s best-selling vehicle and landed in ninth position in July’s overall vehicle ranking. BMW’s latest models – including the iX1, i4, and i5 – performed well in July, while the new iX2 registered more than 1,300 units. Registrations of BMW’s electric models are clearly outpacing those of its Mercedes and Audi counterparts. The Dacia Sandero was the region’s most sought-after car in July, registering 22,400 units – an increase of 34%. This is over 3,000 units more than the second best-selling car, the Volkswagen T-Roc (introduced in 2017). The 10 best-performing cars in July comprised of five SUVs and five hatchbacks. The Volkswagen T-Cross, Toyota C-HR, BMW X1, Peugeot 3008, Skoda Kamiq, Skoda Fabia, Seat Ibiza, Kia Niro, Jeep Avenger, and Mercedes GLC also did well in July. On the other end of the spectrum, those that experienced decline included the Ford Puma; Tesla Model Y; Fiat Panda; Audi A3; Fiat/Abarth 500; Mini Hatch; Opel/Vauxhall Mokka; Kia Picanto, Volkswagen ID.4; Mercedes C-Class; and Skoda Enyaq. Europe’s second-most popular EV of the month was the Volvo EX30, with almost 6,600 registrations. MG registered over 4,000 units of the MG3; Fiat registered 2,636 units of the 600; BMW registered 2,302 units of the i5; Renault registered 2,235 units of its new Scenic model; and Lexus registered 2,186 units of the LBX.

They have a schedule where for each quarter, months 1, 2 and 3, in Month 1, they produce cars. In Month 2 they sail them over from China. And in Month 3, they arrive and are sold. BMW managed to overtake Tesla in the first month of Q3, barely. When Tesla really had no cars for sale. reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 14 hours agoparent\"The title is misleading.\" OK, let's assume the title misled me. What do I now believe as a result that is incorrect. Titles are not summaries. It is expected that readers will read the body of the submission not merely the title. Is the JATO Dynamics report accurate. The title is simply repeating an alleged fact contained in the report. Is it false. If all a reader ever does is read titles, I am afraid \"misled\" is an understatement for how disllusioned that reader may become. People defending Tesla and Musk always come across as try hard. reply Retric 16 hours agoparentprevAnnouncing BMW sold more EV’s in a single month (and they are using registrations which means actual sales) is interesting on its own. Sure it might just be random fluctuation at this point, but that just means they are neck and neck. IMO waiting for a full quarter may be more reasonable, but waiting for a full year and it’s old news. reply avar 11 hours agorootparent> they are using registrations > which means actual sales No, you register a car in order to drive it on public roads in a given country. Some purchased cars are never registered (track use, private export etc.), or defer the registration (no reason to pay road tax if you're not driving it yet). reply klingoff 11 hours agorootparentRight, the useful number instead of a comparison between cars sold to the European public and cars sold at the location as a matter of the logistical accident that it is the head quarters of the manufacturer. reply Retric 11 hours agorootparentprevI didn’t say they were guaranteed to be 1:1, but every registration is an actual sale. The point is the number of sales is going to be grater than or equal to the number of registrations. So this isn’t some gameable metric like number of cars manufactured. It’s possible there is some underlying bias here, but there’s no reason to assume it favors one company over the other enough to offset a 300 car difference in a single month especially as the total numbers just aren’t that high. reply avar 11 hours agorootparentI'm not arguing the thrust of your point here, just noting that there isn't a 1:1 correspondence in case anyone's under that particular misconception. I agree that registrations is probably the least bad metric, and I doubt BMW is gaming it in this case. But saying it isn't gameable is a bridge too far. Manufacturers can trivially game it, it's just marginally more expensive to do so than to shift manufacturing numbers between quarters E.g. BMW used to operate its own car rental, they could manufacture 1k vehicles each month in Q3, then sell them all to themselves in the last month of Q3, and register them at the same time. They can also do this with any \"self dealing\" or corporate registrations by simply sitting on inventory and then lowering their prices, consumers would take care of the rest. reply Retric 7 hours agorootparentThe problem with self dealing is they need to pay taxes at registration. So while sure you can inflate the numbers it isn’t just an on paper thing this is treated as a sale and there’s real consequences of that. As to shifting the quarter something is sold, people aren’t getting a car before registration here. Selling of excess inventory at a discount is still actual sales. reply avar 5 hours agorootparentSure, but now we've shifted from \"isn’t gameable\" to \"gameable for a price\", perhaps to inflate the stock price as you make the news for outselling Tesla or something. And yes, you'd need to deliver the car to consumers. I'm just saying that you can time shift when that happens, if you wanted to inflate the numbers in the short term for whatever reason. reply dylan604 19 hours agoparentprev> BMW registration for the month of July 2024 Do the manufactures consider sales to dealers in their sales numbers or are they actual sales to people that then registers the car as in use? reply bonestamp2 18 hours agorootparentYa, it is kind of weird because the Dealer is actually the OEM's customer. But they measure in sales to the consumer, which is a more useful number because: 1. Dealers will order certain high demand vehicles all day long when they are allowed to do so (\"allocations\") even though they don't have specific consumers in mind to buy them. 2. When new models become available they will also order a bunch of that new model. 3. They will order some random vehicles to look nice in their showroom or on the lot. Fun example: I recently drove by a Porsche dealership that had a bunch of Macan's lined up out front -- one in each color! So, sales to the consumer is more useful because it's the only way to measure actual consumer demand. This is also why you sometimes see a model that hasn't been manufactured for several years show up in these new car sales reports... they were sitting on a lot unsold for that long. You can also find numbers for how many of each model they've manufactured each month, which is useful for different reasons of course, and sometimes they sit on the manufacturer's lot for weeks or months before they're delivered to dealers. We saw this coming out of the pandemic when there weren't enough trains to transport the cars (most cars leave the plant on a train). reply mathgeek 18 hours agorootparentprevRegistration is generally done when the consumer takes possession of the vehicle. reply dylan604 18 hours agorootparentI understand when registration is done, but that does not answer the question. Are the numbers what the makers sell to the dealers but have yet been sold to a buyer, or are they legit sells to buyers? I can see where the makers pad their numbers by using what was sold to the dealers to have on the lots as they've technically sold the car, but it's a misleading number. Same game as storage makers using powers of 10 vs powers of 2 in their capacity claims. reply twobitshifter 17 hours agorootparentthe quote says “registrations” therefore it is when possession is taken reply two_handfuls 19 hours agoprevThe Tesla brand has suffered enormously due to the actions of its owner. reply epistasis 19 hours agoparentYes, Tesla's execution has been really terrible. There's some really good tech inside their cars, but the direction of which cars to make, when, and the investments in non-car tech, the over-promising of \"Full Self Driving,\" etc. All huge detractors. There's also the CEO, who has a huge public profile, deciding to become extremely political, which smart CEOs usually avoid doing because it has little potential to help and lots of potential to hurt. Especially with Musk's particular choice of which politics he wants to push, which alienate not only customers but also the government political forces. Tesla has massively benefited from subsidies to EVs, but is alienating the political party that has enabled all of that. If Tesla had been run by a different CEO for the past, say, 3 years, nearly any CEO, I think it would be in a better position. I really like my Model 3, but I won't be buying it again, and the direction of the Cyber Truck is so repulsive to me that I'm really really against being associated with the brand at all. reply chii 16 hours agorootparent> deciding to become extremely political personally, my purchase decisions do not include the personality or celebrity of the company (CEO or otherwise). There's objective measures you compare against another product (like price, looks, performance, quality etc), and you choose the best fit. reply The_Colonel 12 hours agorootparentIt's not really different from the looks you mention. Looks is not an objective measure. You buy a nice looking car because its look evokes positive feelings in you. But other things can evoke positive feelings by association. The brand itself, marketing campaign, corporate image. For many, these (usually carefully cultivated) associations are overshadowed by a loud, controversial, partisan CEO who doesn't evoke positive feelings. It used to be that Tesla cars evoked for me feelings of progress, sort of futurism (although I never really digged its rather bland design), eco-friendliness. Nowadays I see a Tesla and feel a low-key disgust. reply root_axis 19 hours agorootparentprev> Tesla has massively benefited from subsidies to EVs, but is alienating the political party that has enabled all of that.

This is not an accurate representation. For example, the Twitter acquisition followed a period of Twitter (and most other social media) banning a lot of conservative accounts for publishing truthful reporting (New York Post) or actual satire with the disfavored political leaning (Babylon Bee), at which point Musk did a Twitter poll asking the entire site if Twitter adheres to the principle of free speech: https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1507259709224632344 70% said it didn't, so he bought it. This upset a lot of people (not least the people who liked the preexisting system that tended to ban their political opponents) and they've been characterizing everything he does in a negative light since. So then you'll get a lot of stories about a left-leaning account being suspended with the implication that he's just doing it the other way now, with no investigation into whether the suspension was deserved, or just characterizing the unavoidable false positives and false negatives in moderation as a willful bias etc. That isn't to say he's a saint, but the impression you'd get from reading a lot of this coverage is that he's the devil. reply sangnoir 18 hours agorootparent> Companies do this all the time though.

It's a counterpoint to the notion that progressives who live in cities and ride mass transit are the people the CEO of a car company has to appeal to. Whether the goal is to make more cars electric or just to sell more cars. > My hot take is that his frustrations with Covid lockdowns in California kicked his animus toward Democratic party politicians into high gear. That's probably not irrelevant. The problem with politics right now is that everyone sucks and instead of trying to do better they all just want to tell you that the other side sucks worse, which causes aggressive polarization when most people are only listening to one side's pundits or the other. Everyone is being told that they need to vote against the enemy without ever being told what they're voting for. People (Musk not excluded) then end up in one bubble or the other and the people in the other bubble are obliged to hate them out of tribal loyalty.

Except that then nobody really cares about gender at all. When you want to have things like women's sports or prospective dating interactions in which people may want to have biological children or anything else where sex differences actually matter, what people want you to declare is not your gender but your sex.

After 60k miles, the maintenance costs and electrical gremlins are noticeably frequent.

You’re suggesting that Musk said the attack was justified. He didn’t. He retweeted an article that suggested a connection between the attacker and Paul Pelosi, and Musk added, “There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye.” Musk was careful to acknowledge that the chance that there was more to the story was low (“tiny possibility”). He also later deleted his own tweet within a few hours of it being posted. I don’t see a problem with people speculating about what may have happened. We know what happens when speculation is not allowed - you get situations like the lab leak theory being incorrectly suppressed until it is too late to investigate WIV or hold the CCP accountable. As for why people speculated anything in the Pelosi situation at all: the official recording of the police interaction in this incident has Paul Pelosi telling police that David was a “friend”.

But when the brand is inseparable from Elon's shitposting, it's not something to brag about any more. reply al_borland 18 hours agorootparentI think the number of Uber drivers with Teslas makes it seem like less of a status symbol.

Making cars people can afford is a good thing, but once that happens, it stops being a status symbol. reply cameldrv 18 hours agorootparentIt may not be a flex, but having an electric car is still a statement (less than it used to be, but still) that you're a high tech, forward thinking, environmentally conscious person. The problem is that now it's also a statement that you're a Trump supporter. reply al_borland 17 hours agorootparentThose 2 assumptions are at odds with each other. The Trump supporters I know don’t want anything to do with electric cars, and Trump was the one fighting for coal to remain viable, which is the exact opposite of environmentally conscious. Personally, I have never seen a Tesla and assumed the driver was a Trump supporter. The much bigger stereotype is that the left buys EVs. I don’t think many people are trading in their Cummings diesel 2500 truck for anything electric. The die hard Trump fans would be on Truth Social, not Twitter.

I would say its hard to argue it is likely some factor in the middle. I'd love to see it studied. I'll anecdotally add that I've always found Teslas design language pretty ugly, but did pine after the status of owning one briefly. Now I would never buy one for the association with Musk.

I don't really think Tesla is suffering but I think most of these narratives are in peoples heads and don't reflect reality. reply amluto 19 hours agorootparentI’m personally unconvinced. I test drove some current models a few days ago. Some observations: 1. They have cut costs (or adjusted style?) in highly dubious ways. The forward/reverse selector is gone in most new models, replaced by a swipe zone on the touchscreen that is only present some of the time. The 3 and Y require looking far from the road to see whether you’re signaling left or right — coupled with the turn signal stalk not physically staying in place when signaling, there is no good way to tell the current state of the car. 2. Self driving has taken a step change, IMO into the uncanny valley. A couple years ago, FSD was bad and could maybe go a block or two between failures. Now it can go multiple miles before it screws up dramatically. This seems quite dangerous — it’s hard to be ready to rescue the car when you don’t expect it to mess up. My overall impression was that (a) new Teslas felt like video games, not cars and (b) the older models, circa 2020, with new software seem genuinely superior to current models. I have an old Tesla that I like quite a lot. Even notwithstanding Elon’s behavior, I do not want a new Tesla. P.S. has anyone seriously contemplated the way that water drains from the Cybertruck hood? If they copy that design to other models, I can only imagine they will have huge upcoming warranty/rework/lemon law costs. reply driverdan 19 hours agorootparentprev> Price has dropped, quality increased Has it though?

In those 5 years, it's accumulated a bunch of improvements. I don't exactly have a changelog to work with, but here's what I can think of off the top of my head: - more powerful rear motor, 10% faster 0-60, breaking 10s quarter mile - track mode v3 - heat pump - matrix headlights - adaptive suspension w/ frequency response suspension dampers - ryzen media control unit - triple pane glass - heated steering wheel - sport seating - ventilated seats - usb-c ports - rear entertainment system - HW4 - updated wheels/tires - exterior styling updates (front bumper, non-chrome handles, etc...) - interior styling updates (LED lighting, carbon fiber dash, etc...) Oh, and there's also the fact that I'm only paying 70% of what I did the first time around (inflation adjusted). reply amluto 15 hours agorootparentWith that “triple pane glass” (which I’m pretty sure is laminated glass, not insulated glass), keep in mind a little design issue common to every Tesla ever made: the complete lack of any non-electrical way to open a door from outside. If there’s an electrical failure and someone needs rescuing from the car at all quickly, one needs to break a window. If all the window glass is laminated, this is not so easy. There are stories of people getting out of a Tesla to help their kids out, closing the driver door before opening the back door, and having the electrical system die before opening the rear door. Whoops! reply foobazgt 13 hours agorootparentYes, I suppose if - after ignoring the persistent warning you had days in advance that the 12v is dying - you lose power in the exact few seconds between - first securing every vehicle door - and then proceeding to open any other door - and there's another passenger inside - and they are also incapable of operating a door then you will have to either jump your 12v or otherwise somehow unlock your door. The odds are diminishingly small given all of those factors, but wait there's also more: - You don't have all the accidental 12v drains that happen in other vehicles (lights, accessories, etc... accidentally left running) - The 12v is constantly replenished from the main battery, rather than a more unreliable alternator So, I suppose there's this and then there are also the odds that your passenger is immediately struck by lightning as they exit the vehicle. At least in the former unlikely scenario, emergency responders can help you out with relative ease and little harm. reply amluto 5 hours agorootparentThis may be unlikely, but there are actual reports of this happening: https://www.popsci.com/technology/tesla-lock-issue/ I have also been (briefly) locked out due to what may have been RFI. Teslas are entirely dependent on radio to unlock the doors from outside. reply goodluckchuck 8 hours agorootparentprevI’m mostly referring to the design language.

A lot longer in miles per critical intervention reply ta8645 19 hours agorootparentprevThe step-change is real, and a lot of people don't know that Tesla now has the best self-driving ability out of all the competition. But that's only true on 4th gen hardware, and unfortunately that represents a minority of the vehicles sold to date. reply theluketaylor 18 hours agorootparentMercedes is taking legal liability for their L3 system. That's better than Tesla GM's supercruise allows safe hands free driving as a L2 system. That's better than Tesla Waymo is operating a true L4 system in multiple markets. That's better than Tesla. Tesla has a better than average L2 system in autopilot. They have a downright dangerous L2 system in FSD that through its very design encourages unsafe driving habits. It lulls drivers into a false sense of security, but FSD can still hand control to the driver at the very last moment when they are unprepared to safely operate a vehicle. Research has shown the L2 systems that border on L3 capability are dangerous, which is why all of the competition is staying well clear of that design and yet Tesla is forging ahead. There are times when going against the grain is a path to innovation, like Tesla using thousands of small cells to deliver viable BEVs. Or SpaceX using fast iteration on cheap reusable rockets. This isn't one of those cases as research has shown this pathway is not just non-viable, it's a safety risks to the public. There is a reason everyone else is working on L3 and L4 and developing it under carefully controlled testing conditions and methodologies. Tesla just slaps 'beta' on it and sends 4000 lbs of steel out hoping it doesn't run anyone over. When SpaceX rockets blow up during testing no one gets hurt. That is not true of FSD development. I love my Tesla, but FSD is dangerous and the marketing was well into scam territory.

For an optimal driver-assisted recovery in the latter incident, I needed to have been paying rather close attention to the navigation, the lane lines, and surrounding vehicles, starting before the incident, and I needed to take a rather fast and considered action. It was dicey. But this would have been a complete nonissue if I were _actually driving the car_, because that’s how humans work. The middle ground of not driving but being ready to override instantly is simply not how humans work. reply theluketaylor 18 hours agorootparentprevActual studies have shown autopilot and fsd are at best average on safety.

It doesn’t mean the cars are actually crap, but the company just came off as hella sketchy. Like how they didn’t care about panel gaps or similar issues because people were buying cars sight unseen, just gives this cheap vibe without actually hitting that price point.

Even in the US, virtually all license plates are created by prisoners who earn 8-16 cents an hour.

I just think Tesla can't find footing in the real low-end EV market because of BYD + Renault and associates (that market is small atm so it isn't an issue), never got in the high-end EV market so it has to compete with historic automaker in a market they have a lot of experience in. reply fhdsgbbcaA 16 hours agoparentprevI was firmly against ever buying a Tesla because of Elon’s Twitter escapades.

Lithium batteries have been falling in price for a long time and EV demand was only going to drive new innovations and economies of scale, so even at the time that seemed like a poor bet. BMW wasn't entirely wrong since battery prices stayed quite high during the model lifespan, but it didn't really matter because bet 1) lead to bet 2) 2) Carbon Fibre construction. BMW bet that EVs would need to be light to extract range from small batteries, so they made a CFRP monocoque and made a wager they could find ways to manufacture CFRP at scale more cheaply. They were pretty wrong (though it has led to an explosion of carbon fibre trim options on M models that is nearly pure profit) i3 had such a small battery, but it still had the huge EV cost penalty that made early EVs very niche. That proved pretty fatal, though the few that got one did tend to really like them. That double failure scared BMW pretty badly and they retreated to shared platforms, so every EV they sell can't take advantage of the packaging benefits being an EV allows. There are huge spaces for engines up front that is nearly all wasted. Despite that deficiency BMW has invested a ton into their EV powertrains, so they actually have some of the best efficiency out there. reply NightlyDev 18 hours agorootparentprevBMW has not abandoned it. i3 was a cool cheap car, with a carbon fiber cell. It was ugly as hell, but cool tech. BMW platforms now are both for ICE and EV, but \"Neue klasse\" that will start to arrive soon is a from-scratch, new, electric only platform. That will really make the cars more spacious. The sportiest platform is supposedly architected for 1350 hp, so it will be interesting to see if BMW will take up the lap time fight with Porsche.

Isn't this the biggest difference? Batteries in the floor make a good amount of sense if done right. 1. Just the battery for a -hybrid- (1.1kWh) can weigh at least half as much as a 3 cylinder engine. putting it either under the front or in the trunk is an issue, as now you have to have a more reinforced firewall or reinforced whatever to keep the battery from being an additional force in an impact. 2. Lower center of gravity is always a good thing. > And the weight, of course. 3. Weight is interesting because we start to see some of the fun 'delta-V' issues.

We all need a collective reality check on our spacefaring hopes. reply rockemsockem 33 minutes agoparentWe stopped doing serious space development after Apollo and lost a ton of institutional knowledge between then and when SpaceX started picking up where they left off. Documentation and old drawings, often lacking implementation details, can only take you so far There's no big secret, if we do a thing a lot we will be able to do it consistently and reliably. Boeing has not done a lot of spacecraft design and manufacturing recently. They've spent a bunch of \"time\" on it, but haven't actually produced much. Fortunately other companies, besides just SpaceX, are building lots of spacecraft. reply golergka 22 minutes agorootparentOne could argue that shuttle program didn't end up as successful as was originally hoped, but it is certainly “serious space development”. reply trothamel 55 minutes agoparentprevGiven that SpaceX is about to launch four people on what is more-or-less a joyride (Polaris Dawn), it's really only the government and boeing that seem to be having problems. reply ceejayoz 20 minutes agorootparentSpaceX exists because of that government's significant funding of the company and the prescient decision to award multiple Commercial Cargo/Crew contracts. reply hereme888 0 minutes agorootparentAll space companies exist for that reason. Especially Boeing. SpaceX just happens to be the best in every aspect. hackernewds 13 minutes agorootparentprevand the government should continue to fund private enterprise for innovation. much of the billions for a charger network for EVs has madeJust looking at the $5 billion program dedicated to building charging stations along major highways, Nigro said updated data from 10 states shows the government’s share of building each port is $150,000, on average. That works out to more than 30,000 ports and as many as 7,500 stations, assuming each has four ports (Nigro said the station number will likely be lower, since many stations will have more ports). Even more charging stations and ports can be built with the other $2.5 billion. They did Tesla an enormous favor by pushing the other car manufacturers to adopt their standard. A good use of government power, IMO. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Charging_Standa... armada651 36 minutes agorootparentprev> it's really only the government and boeing that seem to be having problems. As we've seen these past few years, Boeing is perfectly capable of royally screwing things up on its own without the government's involvement. reply somenameforme 11 minutes agorootparentThe problem isn't government meddling, but the government creating perverse incentives. Boeing has an extremely strong relationship with the government, which means they get sent endless billions of dollars with quality being only a distant concern. Because it's not like Congress cares about space - NASA is just seen as a convenient jobs/pork medium. So long as money gets redirected to the right people, they're happy. And so maintaining this relationship, and milking it for all it's worth, becomes much more profitable and reliable than trying to compete, innovate, and bring down prices. On the contrary, high prices and long development times just drive even more profit. Most of their contracts have been cost plus where the government pays for all costs and then gives them a fat chunk of profit on top. Even the fixed price contracts tend to end up getting 'adjusted' over time. Any company solely motivated by profit would probably be destroyed in this system, because the incentives created do not reward competence. reply SlightlyLeftPad 20 minutes agorootparentprevRight, the public-sector government becomes afraid to take risks for political reasons. On the other hand, the publicly traded private sector over-optimizes for shareholder value, putting the cart of gold before the horse; Boeing. SpaceX remains a private company solely focused on their mission undeterred by outside influence which allows engineers the space to do what they do best. There’s a difference and anything that’s truly critical to our lives or human livelihood should consider delisting. Once shareholders demand your company to stray from excellence and quality in the name of raising the bottom line, it’s time to give it a hard look. reply hackernewds 12 minutes agorootparentPrivate companies have shareholders as well. reply delichon 6 minutes agorootparentprevIt'll include the first commercial space walk ever. Calling that a joy-ride either trivializes an epic accomplishment or correctly describes a joy-ride of the gods. Helios's daily commute, but faster. reply baseballdork 33 minutes agorootparentprevThe government (NASA with their commercial space effort) is the reason there's a SpaceX and a dragon to be available as backup. The government seems to be doing alright here. reply hereme888 1 minute agoparentprevwe haven't? isn't this exclusively a Boeing issue? SpaceX should just get the whole contract. reply mattmaroon 43 minutes agoparentprevWe get people to and from low earth orbit safely and (relative to the 60’s) cost efficiently all the time. One failure isn’t an indictment of the whole industry, any more than one broken down car negates how much better cars are today than in the past. reply SoftTalker 42 minutes agoparentprevI fully agree. Personally I don't think we'll ever have an extended manned presence anywhere farther away than the Moon. We might visit Mars in the next century, maybe, but a colony surviving there is pure fantasy. reply diggan 36 minutes agorootparentIt's been 63 years ago since the first human visited the orbit around earth. Since then, development and research happens faster and faster. We now even have commercial companies who are developing space crafts for humans. I don't think we've seen even the beginning of how things will unfold. Just 100 years will render a huge difference from today, and today we're already doing things that were unthinkable ~20 years ago (like reusable rockets). reply kyriakos 9 minutes agorootparentCommercial space flight will become mainstream as soon as it becomes viable to profit from it. Probably via asteroid or moon mining. At that point motivation to be in space will hit its peak. Let's not forget why humans went to orbit and the moon in the first place. reply garaetjjte 24 minutes agorootparentprevIn other words, we are almost as far away from moon landings as they were from Wright brothers first flight. Not particularly optimistic. reply SlightlyLeftPad 14 minutes agorootparentJust a couple hundred years ago, Settlers who risked their lives and spent several months on cutting edge technology (aka wooden sail boats) to find “new” land would like to have a word. reply maxerickson 29 minutes agorootparentprevWhy are we gonna sustain a presence on the moon? reply SoftTalker 24 minutes agorootparentWe might. I'm not saying we will. Neither place is habitable without exhorbitant levels of support and expense, but the moon is far closer. reply electriclove 23 minutes agoparentprevSpaceX is solving this and many similar issues. reply zo1 36 minutes agoparentprevWe have to have a collective look at what 1st-world governments, the media, and most \"ordinary\" people have been focusing on since the late 60's. The world is not mobilizing towards these big \"civilization advancing\" goals, we're all just faffing about solving the next tiny little thing infront of our faces. That plus we're breeding mediocrity and not promoting excellence through meritocracy. This is purely cultural, and it's right infront of us every day to see and participate in (or not). reply nebula8804 22 minutes agorootparentIn the 1950s during the \"Space Race\" a single household could be sustained with one breadwinner. Today two breadwinners can't even sustain a dramatically smaller household. Your \"excellence through meritocracy\" leads to mass unemployment ala Twitter layoffs and a concentration of wealth to the 1%. Fuck your \"civilization advancing\" goals. At least get the very fundamentals of society right first then talk about all the value add. reply biscottigelato 12 minutes agorootparentWouldn't you wonder why then that it seems, at least according to you, society have went backwards and not forward in this time frame? \"We have to have a collective look at what 1st-world governments, the media, and most \"ordinary\" people have been focusing on since the late 60's.\" still applies. Fixing the everyday problem is part of the problem-set to get to the \"civilization advancing\" goals. reply Arch-TK 57 minutes agoparentprevElon Musk has been doing what he does best, selling people on unrealistic pipe dreams. reply static_motion 47 minutes agorootparentI'm all for holding him accountable to his outlandishly unrealistic claims, but he and the entire SpaceX team are wholly responsible for the biggest advancements and innovations in space explorations since the space race. Credit where credit is due. reply WalterBright 36 minutes agorootparentPeople thought the Wright Brothers were crazy, too. Innovators are often dismissed as having outlandish, unrealistic claims. And then they succeed. And, frankly, how are you going to hold him \"accountable\"? It's his and his investors' money he's spending. They know what they signed up for. P.S. I own a bit of Tesla and SpaceX stock. It could go to zero, and I'm still happy to have a \"piece\" of what Musk is accomplishing. The only thing I'm mad about is I owned some Twitter stock, but when Musk bought it I was cashed out against my desires. Though I do understand Musk wanting to run Twitter as he saw fit rather than having to listen to activist shareholders. Musk is one of, it not the, greatest entrepreneur in American history. reply CydeWeys 28 minutes agorootparent> The only thing I'm mad about is I owned some Twitter stock, but when Musk bought it I was cashed out against my desires. You got lucky. Twitter's revenue is down 80% since it went private, and your shares would correspondingly be worth a tiny fraction of what they were originally worth if you still owned them. Musk has succeeded with other companies but his Twitter acquisition has been a total failure. He simply doesn't understand how to run a social networking company. reply WalterBright 23 minutes agorootparentI'm a long term investor, and I wouldn't bet against Musk long term. > Twitter's revenue is down 80% since it went private Twitter's costs are down 80%, too. I wouldn't be surprised if X was currently profitable, though since it is privately held, who know. reply CydeWeys 9 minutes agorootparentThe point is, the stock would likely be down at least 5X, so if you wanted to be a long-term investor, you could take the cash that was forcefully cashed out and re-buy in now and get over 5X the share of the company. Selling high and re-buying in low is a very good strategy if you can actually do it, and you have the opportunity to do it! But you certainly don't want to be the bagholder who held it when it was high (the price Elon was willing to pay for it) and then rode it all the way down to the bottom when it cratered. SoftTalker 40 minutes agorootparentprevWhat is SpaceX doing that the Apollo project (or the Soviets, for that matter) wasn't doing 50 years ago. Re-usable booster stages is all I can really think of. reply static_motion 25 minutes agorootparentBeyond the cost aspect that other commenters have referred to, they're evolving tech. They're the first ones to have a working full-flow staged combustion cycle rocket engine (the Raptor, currently used in the Starship prototypes), something the Soviets tried before and failed. Their Dragon capsule was also a gigantic technological leap relative to the admittedly tried-and-true Soyuz, and it also looks far more comfortable for astronauts than the Soyuz does. reply mjamesaustin 34 minutes agorootparentprevLowering the cost of mass to orbit by a factor of 100+, oh is that all? What did Henry Ford do really for cars, the assembly line is all I can think of. reply WalterBright 35 minutes agorootparentprevDoing it for 10% of the cost. reply SoftTalker 26 minutes agorootparentCosts always come down as technologies mature. reply WalterBright 20 minutes agorootparentIt's 10% of NASA's current costs. Costs for NASA never came down. reply exe34 35 minutes agorootparentprevSpaceX is also doing right now what Apollo and the Soviets are not doing right now. That's very important, because they are using modern materials and manufacturing techniques and developing new concepts. If SpaceX (and soon their competitors, hopefully) manage to keep themselves in business (and they might, because of the profit motive, which is enduring, rather than national pride, which comes and goes), there's a fair chance our species might bootstrap its way out of the ancestral gravity well this time around. reply biscottigelato 7 minutes agorootparentProfit has not been the goal. If profit is the goal, one'd start another eyeball catching internet application. As the joke goes, the way to make a small fortune in space, is to start with a big fortune. SpaceX is the exception, not the norm. It worked only because of the unwavering, perhaps maniacal drive of one man. The man being hated on all over the place here that shall not be named. I'd suspect the space industry will slow down drastically again if somehow that man stops putting space as a priority (or at least one of his priorities). Currently I don't think there's any one or company that is able to push the envelope AND still turn an operational profit at the same time. Even Starship program is not. Making it work is the exception, not some inevitable norm as others are making it as. Aka - \"just because of government money\". reply WalterBright 50 minutes agorootparentprevLooks to me like Musk is delivering on his \"pipe dreams\". reply brainphreeze 44 minutes agorootparentprevWe've been dreaming of space travel since long before Elon was born. The hate people have for Elon is absolutely wild. reply exe34 34 minutes agorootparentHe's the richest man on Earth and he acts like a loser. I've heard that SpaceX and Tesla do well in spite of him, rather than because of him, but I'm not in a position to judge. I can admire the success of his workers while simultaneously calling him a sad loser. reply WalterBright 31 minutes agorootparentI recommend reading a biography of Musk and the creation of Tesla. It's abundantly clear neither would exist without Musk. Anyone would want to be called such a \"sad loser\"! reply monkeywork 24 minutes agorootparentprevAnd what exactly have you accomplished in your life that has bettered others' lives? Don't get me wrong it's perfectly fine to criticize someone on specific things - however, you are just blanket calling someone you don't know a sad loser... honestly says more about you than him. reply panick21_ 49 minutes agorootparentprevSpaceX already regularly brings people to LEO and back reliabily. And they are working on the moon. Boieng not being able to do it isnt relevant. reply option 42 minutes agorootparentprevlook at track record. Not at tweets. He has delivered more than anyone else. By far and in several areas. reply WalterBright 32 minutes agorootparentI follow Musk on twitter. I usually get a chuckle from his tweets. It's nice to see a major figure speak his mind rather than the careful pablum filtered through a PR department and read off a teleprompter. reply dbg31415 9 minutes agorootparentIt’s hard to have any respect for a racist. Y’know? For me, that’s all it comes down to. If you can say, “I’m ok with racism as long as he delivers!” I guess that case can be made. But 2024… how does Musk still not have the judgement to just keep his mouth shut when he doesn’t have something nice to say? reply WalterBright 2 minutes agorootparentI hear \"racist\" bandied about so often it has lost its meaning. > how does Musk still not have the judgement to just keep his mouth shut when he doesn’t have something nice to say? I'm old, and no longer care what people say. It's what they do that matters. hackernewds 11 minutes agorootparentprevMusk is the epitome of \"never meet your idols\" reply zpeti 46 minutes agoparentprevDoes spacex not exist in your world or what? reply option 43 minutes agorootparentwe need more than one spacex. reply biscottigelato 7 minutes agorootparentI agree. You are free to start one too~ reply exe34 39 minutes agorootparentprevThat appears to be answering a question orthogonal to: > we still haven't figured out how to get a single person to low Earth orbit and back in a safe and cost efficient way reply zpeti 32 minutes agorootparentprevWe have Ariane space, rocket lab, blue origin.

They don't want to cut that mission short. reply dylan604 1 hour agorootparentSure, if Starliner returns in auto mode successfully, then Boeing will be able to save face, and NASA will be able to take some stock in that. However, if there is a viable alternate option that has a much better track record of working, NASA would potentially not survive as an agency if there was a catastrophic ending to a Starliner return with the astronauts on board. So from a keep humans safe while still attempting to complete the Starliner mission as much as possible, to me this is the best solution. In fact, it's kind of bonus for Boeing to test the automated return that was not part of the original mission.reply acomjean 1 hour agoprevI dont blame NASA, who knows what else is wrong with that capsule. I feel bad for Boeing. Though to be honest when I worked on a project where we were a Boeing sub (defense)we didn’t really care for them.. Competition is good, and it’s sad they can’t get their act together. Hopefully someone else will, though it will take years. The problem with Boeing is they seem to treat all their projects like the non competitive defense space.. reply diggan 1 hour agoparent> I feel bad for Boeing. I don't quite understand this. Boeing is a for-profit company that chose to try to optimize profits over anything else, and now that's biting them in the butt. What's to feel bad about? That the executives made the wrong decision? reply spacemadness 1 hour agorootparentI think they meant they feel bad for the people actually doing work, not the people strategizing around wringing out the company for short-term profits so they can move on and do it again someplace else. At least I really hope that’s what they meant. You never know on HN. reply diggan 52 minutes agorootparentBut wouldn't you say \"I feel bad for the people working at X\" in that case? And besides, isn't that also a quite strange sentiment? Replace Boeing with Facebook/Google, and it still sounds strange to feel bad for the workers at those companies when the executives make bad decisions like chasing profits over all. I mean, why? People obviously like it there, otherwise they wouldn't work there, so why feel bad for them? reply tass 34 minutes agorootparentThere is a lot of pride to be had from seeing something you worked on, with your own hands, successfully work - look at mission control videos for examples of how excited people get. Conversely, if it fails, there’s a lot of disappointment. You can’t compare something like these massive pieces of hardware with people inside failing and taking all your work with it, with some software launch that maybe fails and takes a couple of bugs to be fixed before relaunch. The Boeing story is tragic because they were a source of pride for America overall, played a huge part in winning WW2, made some great technological advances, but succumbed to MBAs fleecing all their goodwill. There are still world class aerospace engineers working there, and sure they could probably get a job somewhere else, but they might need to uproot their lives to do so. reply CydeWeys 21 minutes agorootparentprev> Replace Boeing with Facebook/Google, and it still sounds strange to feel bad for the workers at those companies when the executives make bad decisions like chasing profits over all. I don't understand this sentiment at all. I know quite a few people who worked on the Google Domains team. It was a good team, a good product, and it sadly was all blown up by some senior executive decision that didn't make any sense. Why can't I feel bad for the workers I knew whose product got deleted out from under their feet?? Some of them are in the process of getting laid off now! reply upon_drumhead 1 hour agorootparentprevBoeing is made up of a lot of people, some who have done their absolute best. They don't deserve the failure that their leadership caused. I feel bad for Boeing employees, but I don't feel bad for their management. reply lysace 52 minutes agorootparentThis trope that anyone who is not a manager is Good and anyone who is a manager is Bad rubs me the wrong way. The reality is often a lot more complex and nuanced. reply scarmig 40 minutes agorootparentMost of the time, workers and managers are smart, well-meaning, and hard-working. Even executives (though as you get higher and higher up, you see more and more people whose qualification is political skills and not expertise). The issue with Boeing is less any individual and more institutional decay. Over time, a spigot of effectively unconditional cash corrupts an organization, especially once anyone with enough internal weight to fight against it is no longer involved in the day-to-day. Give it 20 years, and SpaceX will be the same way. reply hackernewds 8 minutes agorootparentIt could be individual incompetence as well, why discount that and thumb our ears? reply scarmig 0 minutes agorootparentEvery organization will have incompetent individuals. A healthy organization is able to remove them; a typical one will blunt their effects; and an unhealthy one will allow them to reproduce themselves and seize power. We want it all to be a matter of just one or two incompetent individuals, because then the solution is simple. We just need to be aware that incompetent individuals exist, and through sheer force of will we can prevent them from destroying great things! But a much darker possibility is that it's something inherent to complex systems. Then, there's nothing to do to escape the inevitable cycle. Whatever brilliant schemes we come up with are doomed to failure, because the issue isn't individuals being stupid but institutional incapability to repair itself. upon_drumhead 2 minutes agorootparentprevBecause while the issues are serious and many, Boeing is still making extremely safe and working airplanes. It's impressive and shows that in general, things are going right. It doesn't excuse the decay and issues, but this isn't a case where everything they do is faulty. they're just held to an extremely high bar. mlhpdx 1 hour agorootparentprevTreating Boeing as a single entity is absurd. The people there have done great work and their collective contributions to the people of the US and world at large is very much appreciated by many (including myself). It is a tragedy that what was even greater has been so badly diminished by the greed and incompetence of a few. Hating what’s happened to Boeing (and perhaps those responsible for it) is very different than hating Boeing. reply mym1990 1 hour agorootparentprevThere are still some, even many, people there that are doing their jobs as well as they can at the expense of bad executive decisions. I’m sure morale there is not great. I don’t feel bad for the executives at all, or the company really, but there are likely some great people that are just getting kicked around based on the crisis of the week. reply diggan 48 minutes agorootparentBut it's exactly the same at Facebook/Google/Amazon/Palantir and countless of other places, yet people chose to work at those places. Why feel bad for them? They've made their choices, and if they're not happy with those anymore, they can make new choices. reply vardump 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't think anyone is feeling bad for Boeing's executives.

Want an example? SpaceX is a so called \"Engineers driven\" company. >At this point, Starliner is actually safe enough (less 1/270 of failure chance) to bring those 2 astronauts back home. The only reason why NASA is not using Starliner, is because there is an election 3 months away.

The government constraints on aerospace projects doesn't help. There's a reason SpaceX moves so much faster; they don't have to justify and explain things to taxpayers. Beyond that, the book makes a good case for how unrealistic a long-term colony on Mars is... at least in the short term (Short being the next 50 to 100 years). My biggest take away is: for all his talk, Musk basically just wants to be the Uber to Mars: shuttling people there and back. He don't seem serious about _actually_ solving the problems of how to stay alive and thrive once we get there. I found it sort of depressing as first, as I'd love to see people loving on Mars in my lifetime. But when I thought about it, I saw that they outlined a bunch of really important problems we should be working on as a society. The sooner we work on those problems, the better.

No company was ever able to replicate the Skunkworks, though many have tried. I've read biographies of both - well worth reading for anyone who wants to read about great Americans. reply blackeyeblitzar 59 minutes agoprevThis is evidence of the utter failure of constantly pumping money into a dated cartel of prime contractors that have no incentive to do better. I am very thankful we have Elon Musk to be bold enough to enter this impossibly capital heavy market and show a better way. I hope this is the start of a reset on how taxes are funneled to government contractors. reply roughly 1 hour agoprev [–] If we're going to keep Boeing around because it's in the national security interest to have an American airplane manufacturer, we need to either nationalize it, break it up, or remove the entire leadership class. The company exists at this point for the same reason that Chase bank does: because they cannot fail, because we will not let them. The market structure will not work for this company, at least not the way corporate management is done in 2024, and if I'm the Air Force or any other branch of the US military reliant on Boeing goods, I'm not feeling particularly optimistic about my supply of Boeing parts, planes, and armaments right now. reply sgc 46 minutes agoparentBreaking Boeing up would make it ineffective and likely lead to its failure. You could maybe spin off a couple small divisions, but not more than that. Nationalization is a non-starter in the US - not worth wasting the time and effort to try to make it happen. The only real option is to remove the current leadership, and place the company into Conservatorship to force the new leadership to do the right thing - ideally for at least 10 years, but 5 to 7 years would be the more likely political outcome of such a move. I think virtually anybody who wants to see Boeing succeed long term, would get on board with this option. At the same time, the FAA needs to be reformed (and funded) to bring it back to the enforcement agency it should be. They got into bed with Boeing and their lack of oversight in civilian aircraft let the corporate sickness fester and have a safe space from which to spread throughout the organization. reply icegreentea2 36 minutes agorootparentIt's not clear to me that splitting up Boeing in commercial+business jet, defense, and space would make it more ineffective than its current incarnation? Boeing's ability to purpose build commercial jet frames for defense applications both seems to be... a) not performing well (see KC-46), and also b) not a future growth industry with the focus shifting to the Indo-Pacific and peer conflict (given the vulnerability of these types of platforms). reply sgc 17 minutes agorootparentIt's not a technical problem. It's that they need to stay too-big-to-fail, to be able to resist the very aggressive competition of other aircraft manufacturers. If they are broken up, the smaller companies would not be able to compete effectively, and they would also be immediate acquisition targets by largely foreign competitors. I agree with others here that think they need to be a quasi-government-run company, but in the US that is done through oversight, managing the manager rather than stepping into the management role directly. Of course we have to absolutely gut that awful management with extreme prejudice, to start. reply ethbr1 1 hour agoparentprevWe should just go ahead and admit that Boeing is a government company, and that's what it takes to be one of the big-3 global commercial aircraft manufacturers these days (Boeing, Airbus, Comac). Fire all Boeing senior leadership, go through the remainder of the company with a fine toothed comb and fire anyone mid-level who did anything dumb, then conduct a search to replace everyone. Make the government an explicit stakeholde (25%?) with board representation. Dilute shareholders ($0.50 per dollar?) for investing in a bad company, but make any employee shareholders who are still employed whole ($1 per $1). reply roughly 54 minutes agorootparentYup. There's no market pressure of note on Boeing, otherwise they'd be even the slightest bit concerned that their planes are falling out of the sky. They exist to turn government contracts into stock buybacks. reply icegreentea2 43 minutes agorootparentIt's not true that there's no market pressure on Boeing. It's true that Airbus' production capacity limitations have blunted the impact of the QA issues on Boeing's financial performance, but Boeing is in fact suffering. They've been suffering for at least a year (their net profit margin has been 0 or lower for the last 4 quarters). Their stock price is down ~20% from a year ago, and is down ~35% from their high from just before the Air Alaska incidence. The problem isn't that management assumed that there would be no market pressure, the problem is that management assumed that engineering and production excellence \"just happens\". They're not dumb enough to believe that shoddy products won't effect their financial position - they just don't know how to make non-shoddy products while also posting decent financials. reply protastus 1 hour agoparentprevThis company needs to be audited, starting at the top.

In other words, they're a private corporation being used to fill a role the government deems essential, and consequently probably the safest place on earth to put your money right now, at least with regards to the risk of a bank failure. (As I noted elsewhere, they're treated much differently than Boeing, in that they're audited, stress-tested, and generally put under the kind of scrutiny warranted by that kind of role.) reply AnonMO 1 hour agoparentpreva better bank would have been Wells Fargo. Chase and JPM are not in the same category they are profit machines with great balance sheets. that's why they swooped in last year during the bank crisis and took over some banks. reply dylan604 1 hour agorootparentWells Fargo is a better example of criminal vs negligent. Has Boeing verged into criminal? It's not like they were continuously bilking the gov't for all of this, which to me keeps them out of criminal. but of course, IANAL reply roughly 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, I'm mostly referring to Chase's relationship with the Fed, FDIC, and regulators - they're clearly the bank of choice for rescuing distressed banks, and they're the largest bank in the country by a pretty substantial margin. You're right about the difference, though - they're stable, well-run, and with a solid balance sheet, and it's clear the tradeoff for being effectively the Bank of the US is they're regulated and stress-tested six ways to Sunday. If that were the model being applied to Boeing, this'd be a different story, but I think there's been a clear decision made that Chase is critical infrastructure and should be treated & audited like it that hasn't been made about Boeing yet. reply misiti3780 1 hour agoparentprev [–] 100% agree. reply Consider applying for YC's first-ever Fall batch!

Minutes after opening the account I was perma-banned and I was told there was no appeal. So... what did you do that got you banned? I know it's popular to hate on PayPal, but they're not in the business of banning people, they're in the business of facilitating payments. Banning people for literally no reason doesn't serve that cause. Almost every time, when you pull on threads from this sort of story, it unravels into high-risk accounts receiving unusual payments from unusual places all within a limited timeframe where PayPal (or any payments processor for the matter) doesn't have time to evaluate your legitimacy. Your story might be the one out of a thousand that was on the wrong end of a rouge bot or something, but I have serious doubts. PayPal processes billions of dollars of payments annually. They don't do that by banning everyone for no reason. Did you use a VPN to deceive them on your location? Did you try to open a business account in the US despite being a UK citizen? Something you did tripped their system into believing you are/were not legitimate, and it's likely you would have also been banned from other similar-tier payment processors, such as CyberSource, Authorize.net, etc. reply noodlesUK 19 hours agorootparentI hadn’t even made a single transaction before I got banned, so presumably there was something about my email address, phone number or postal address they didn’t like. I was registering in the UK with all UK details etc. something tripped, but I have no idea what. Upon contacting PayPal’s executive complaints team using details I found on Reddit they decided to do a whole bunch of KYC and reverse the ban, but they were adamant that it was irreversible when I initially contacted them using their normal phone number. To this day I have no idea why (and it wasn’t clear to me that the complaints people even knew), just that something flagged in their automated system. There are always false positives with this kind of thing, and you can only hope that you don’t become one. I’m lucky that it was possible to fix my issue but as automated decision making becomes more common there will be increasingly large numbers of people who are just arbitrarily denied access to services with absolutely no recourse. reply OsrsNeedsf2P 20 hours agorootparentprevPaypal froze my account over a decade ago for not being 18.

I opened account for my mum, and I've seen how when I want to send or receive (legitimate and small) payments for her PayPal just says \"cannot proceed with action\" or something like this. It is better if you submit your passport and other data, but still far from painless. Their automatic systems flag transaction and then you are stuck, sometimes for ages. If you use browsers that prevent tracking or VPNs (legitimate and needed in many cases), then it is even worse. It takes half a year for the new account to become more trusted and be less flagged. Internet is full of stories how PayPal blocks people and they can't find why or appeal. reply Alupis 20 hours agorootparentYou are talking about something entirely different than myself or the OP. OP, and this discussion is about PayPal the credit card processor (their main business), not PayPal the p2p payments things a la Venmo. For p2p payments, you do need to verify the account, otherwise it will be locked. They go out of their way to tell you this, so if you refuse to do so, do not be surprised when your account is limited or locked. > It takes half a year for the new account to become more trusted and be less flagged. This is entirely made up. Simply verify you account. They offer several ways. They have to verify who they are allowing to receive/send money for very obvious reasons. Fun fact, people love Venmo and hate PayPal - yet few realize they're actually the same company. reply BobAliceInATree 20 hours agoparentprevThese large companies have to deal with large amounts of spam, scammers, and regulations.

Nothing had changed in my extension in _years_. What could it possibly have been? This happened right after some well known extensions got busted on the webstore after being sold to shady people and the webstore got bad press for it. Google came out and said they were improving their security measures. I assumed Google was doing some kind of automated scanning and with that in mind I took a wild guess... I wrote my own JavaScript minifier/obfuscation build tool and figured it was probably triggering the automated system (likely due to compressed strings). I stopped using my build tool and compiled the extension with no minification or compression at all. However, I couldn't upload it (me being banned).

The re-uploading the app (since they asked me to send a new compliant version of the app) was what I think was the cause of my account's closure. reply geoelectric 20 hours agorootparentUnless someone explicitly told you that’s the reason for the original takedown, I’m deeply skeptical you’ve got it right. That’s especially true with the chorus of redditors saying they also use that function. I realize you didn’t find anything else that looked like it crossed stuff up, but I’d bet money the bot was looking at something entirely different. For one, looking at the API docs for SleepTimeout doesn’t suggest it changes the saved OS-level user settings. It’s just a screen keep-awake like many games use without permission. And for another, I’m pretty sure for minor stuff that can be easily remedied they don’t nuke your app listing to the ground so you can’t remedy it. Even the bit where they nuked your entire account on reupload implies a pretty good chance that whatever was offending the scan was still in there. I doubt they insta-ban everyone who uploads a similar app again unless it somehow registers as evasion. That bot was almost certainly identifying your app as a scam—or you as a scammer—for some other reason. It’s possibly not even one that would make sense to you. That’s the problem with bots.

The developers at Big Tech don't get banned from Google Play because Google isn't going to de-list Netflix, Spotify or Microsoft. reply JohnMakin 21 hours agoprev> But in their initial mail they stated that, if I sent a new version compliant with their terms, they could re-enable the app. But I couldn't send any new revisions since my app got completely deleted, my Google Play Console's panel was totally inaccesible. This seems like a very common pattern amongst google \"support\" - \"Hey just access the thing we just completely locked you out of and we'll fix your problem.\" It can't be an accident. reply bbarnett 20 hours agoparentIt can't be an accident. Most people handling support have zero tech background, and are trying to match your questions to an internal search engine with answers. They literally know nothing, have no experience with the platform, and have to pick an answer after searching and getting 20 to choose from. reply x0x0 15 hours agorootparentFrom personal experience, the people handling paid support for Pixel owners who pay for Google One are both (1) human; and (2) too fucking stupid to have object permanence.

If Play Store, App Store etc became EMPTY because the only apps are from big tech they totally loose any customers appeal and fails quickly. Remember the old concept of the union who makes the strength? Personally I do AVOID as best as I can any third party walled garden and even developing on their APIs because I know their are closed hostile ecosystems. We have to accept what freedom demand and simply go a step at a time toward a ban by laws of any closed software, any walled garden and so on. A step at a time means start not working on, so for, them today, explaining why as much as possible and inviting people toward open platforms.

Remember the old concept of the union who makes the strength? The vast majority of consumers aren't even aware that alternative app stores exist - and if they ever become even remotely popular it's pretty much a guarantee that there'll be scare campaigns from BigCorp because they're full with \"malware\". Heck, who's going to install some random third-party app store just to install a mobile game? Play Store / App Store have essentially become a monopoly. If you don't have an app on the official app stores, your company might as well not exist. Everyone knows this, so everyone tries to get their apps published on the official app stores. Google and Apple are very much aware of this too, and they just don't care about small apps because it's not making them enough money. Unless you're big enough to have your own account manager, you might just as well not exist at all. reply mystified5016 20 hours agoparentprevBecause that's where the users are. F-Droid is a novelty for an extremely small niche of users. You can't reach most users, and you can't charge them money through the app store.

Initially launched on Google Play, the game gained support but was removed due to \"Malware or Deceptive Behavior.\" The issue stemmed from a code function keeping the phone screen on without user consent, violating Google Play's policies. Despite appealing and offering to fix the problem, Ed’s developer account was permanently closed, preventing future app submissions. He reflects on the unfortunate situation and the significant impact of a small mistake, expressing frustration and disappointment over losing his project and the opportunity to share his game with others. reply glzone1 21 hours agoprev [–] If I'm reading these, he got his notice from Google (changing device settings without user consent). They don't have time to go around with folks - you get I think one human look at things (maybe). If they've removed an app (rather than rejecting it or suspending it) then you absolutely need to figure out why and fix things before appealing or republishing? They are explicit about that. Do not republish an app with a policy violation I think. I think if folks slowed down the appeals and actually fixed things first they'd have better outcomes. reply EdGrace 21 hours agoparentI couldn't fix anything because, even though their mail said \"send a new compliant version for revision\", I was not allowed to send any new version because the app got deleted. So I thought what they meant is to send a new version in a new app, since the current app was not available anymore. reply Hizonner 20 hours agoparentprev> They don't have time to go around with folks Then I guess they'll just have to find the time.

    "originBody": "TECH·X Elon Musk was just forced to reveal who really owns X. Here’s the list BYELEANOR PRINGLE Bill Ackman, Elon Musk and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud are connecting with the ownership of X, formerly Twitter. LEFT TO RIGHT: JEENAH MOON/BLOOMBERG - GETTY IMAGES, CHESNOT - GETTY IMAGES, CHESNOT - GETTY IMAGES Bill Ackman and Sean “Diddy” Combs are among the list of owners of Elon Musk’s X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. The platform has been forced to disclose its investors as part of a lawsuit brought by former employees, who are seeking payment of arbitration fees incurred following Musk’s purchase of the site. Previously, X has argued that its investors were confidential as a matter of “routine practice and policy,” but this week, a federal judge in California ruled to unseal the list of the site’s owners. Among the nearly 100 owners of the social media giant are some familiar names, both from the world of investment and within the X universe. Previously, high-profile investors like Fidelity have been connected with X, most notably because the investment vehicle’s filings implied a 72% drop in the company’s value since Musk took it over. However, the latest filing reveals the investment behemoth’s backing of the platform, with almost 30 separate Fidelity-linked entities holding stakes in the brand. This week’s unsealed documents also lay bare the lesser-known stakeholders in the company. The list seen by Fortune reveals the Pershing Square Foundation owns a stake in X. If the name sounds familiar, that’s because of its link to Pershing Square Holdings, founded by billionaire investor Bill Ackman 20 years ago. Although the foundation of the same name is led by an independent senior leadership team, Ackman and his wife, Neri Oxman, are co-trustees. Ackman is a vocal user of X and frequently uses the platform to address other high-profile individuals and entities. He has used it to debate Shark Tank star Mark Cuban and raise questions about the leadership of his alma mater, Harvard University. Elsewhere on the list of owners is Oracle founder Larry Ellison. The stake in X comes via the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust, the principal business of which, per an SEC report filed in 2008 and seen by Fortune, is to “hold the assets and estate of Mr. Ellison.” The interests of the trust and Oracle bear no relation to each other, the SEC filing adds. Unlike Ackman, Ellison is not an avid user of the site. Despite having more than 130,000 followers, Ellison has posted twice—once in 2012 and once in 2023. Another notable name on the list is Sean Combs Capital. While SEC filings show no matches for the company, the business has previously been linked to the American rapper Diddy—previously known as Puff Daddy—who has launched a number of businesses under his birth name. These have included the Sean Combs Foundation, Combs Investments, and more recently the umbrella brand for his holdings, Combs Global. Musk has also managed to attract some royal attention for his endeavor, with HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud also featured on the list. The Saudi prince has a net worth just shy of $19 billion, per Forbes, and also has holdings in the likes of luxury hotels the Four Seasons and the Savoy, as well as other technology firms like ride-sharing company Lyft. It also seems that despite his criticism of Musk’s leadership, Jack Dorsey still owns shares in the platform he founded via the Jack Dorsey Remainder LLC. The Twitter cofounder previously backed the Tesla CEO in his takeover of the company but walked back his support earlier this year, telling a member on rival social media platform Bluesky, “It all went south.” Doubling down on investments Among the less eminent names are some organizations that not only hold stakes in X as a business but have also seen senior leaders pitch in. Take the likes of Danilo Kawasaki and Ross Gerber. According to the filing, the pair are named as individual investors in X but also have a stake in the business they lead, the wealth and investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki. Elsewhere on the list are the Silicon Valley VCs one might expect: 8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia. The list, of course, also features Musk himself. Via the Elon Musk Revocable Trust, the SpaceX founder is also listed. Musk purchased the site for $44 billion in 2022, though the filing did not make clear the proportion of his investment versus that of others. Since then, the business has been beleaguered by departing advertisers, mass layoffs, and criticism of Musk’s strategy. X did not immediately respond to Fortune‘s request for comment.

One outrageous investment choice has brought attention to several other dubious choices for that particular fund premise. reply kerkeslager 16 hours agorootparentprevI mean, any competent lawyer suing Fidelity for misrepresenting the \"Blue-Chip-ness\" of the fund's holdings is going to list holdings like that as well. Twitter is just the holding that's most likely to get noticed, not because it's the least \"Blue Chip\" of the holdings, but because it's the most likely to cause (arguably justified) moral outrage. The morality has little bearing on the justification for the case, but it might have a big impact on whether people are likely to pursue the case in the first place. reply ProAm 17 hours agorootparentprevThat is sort of whataboutism commenting. While yes, but still, not the point being argued. reply gruez 17 hours agorootparentNo, the point is that if the fund hasn't been sued for the past few decades of its existence for holding non-well known companies (or whatever your definition of \"blue chip is\"), they're probably not going to get sued for holding x holdings, inc. reply kerkeslager 17 hours agorootparentI think that could be the point if the question was \"Will the fund be sued for [...]?\" but the question was \"Can the fund be sued for [...]?\", which likely was intended to ask if such a lawsuit could reasonably be expected to win. It seems to me that the presence of other even less \"blue-chip\" holdings in Fidelity's blue chip funds would make a lawsuit more credible, not less credible. That said, I don't see many entities with the will and funding to pursue this lawsuit. The SEC has way more obvious problems to solve than clarifying the definition of \"blue chip\" in court, institutional investors aren't usually going to pursue a suit on moral outrage, and the average individual has no chance in court against Fidelity's legal team. reply gruez 2 hours agorootparent>It seems to me that the presence of other even less \"blue-chip\" holdings in Fidelity's blue chip funds would make a lawsuit more credible, not less credible. From the prospectus: >Principal Investment Strategies > [...] > Normally investing at least 80% of assets in blue chip companies (companies that, in Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC (FMR)'s view, are well-known, well-established and well-capitalized), which generally have large or medium market capitalizations.

On top of that, even if there are companies that aren't \"blue chip\", it's fine as they're below 20%. reply tbrownaw 16 hours agorootparentprevNo. Whataboutism is an attempt to change the topic. \"Why are you wasting time on A when B is so much more important?\" The comment you're replying to is more \"that reasoning would imply Z, which does not appear to be the case.\" (If it was assumed that people already knew about those other companies, then the comment would be more calling out an isolated demand for rigor... which is also not whataboutism despite occasionally being denounced as such.) reply unclad5968 17 hours agorootparentprevWithout discussing nuance the question isnt meaningful. The answer to \"can X be sued for Y\" is always yes. reply kerkeslager 17 hours agorootparent> The answer to \"can X be sued for Y\" is always yes. ...which is why taking that question literally probably isn't being a good listener. If someone is asking a question with an obvious answer if taken literally, probably that means they're not intending to ask that question literally. Yes, they could ask their question more specifically, but it's up to us as listeners to try to understand people too. Communication, famously, is not a one-person activity[1]. Typically I'd assume \"can X be sued for Y?\" means \"can one reasonably hope to win a civil suit against X for Y?\" unless I have reason to believe that the speaker is very un-knowledgeable about U.S. law.

And for some reason education posts? reply tetromino_ 4 hours agorootparent> for some reason education posts Well, the reason, if I understand the critics' arguments correctly, is that compulsory public education was instituted a century ago (a) quickly, without serious policy discussion or any experimental evidence and (b) with the goal of solving a very specific social problem that existed a hundred years ago (poor families migrating en masse from the countryside to cities to work in the factory, and their bored young children wandering around city streets engaging in mischief while both parents were busy instead of learning useful skills like milking cows or reading the Bible, which would have been the case back in the countryside) - and it's not quite clear whether in today's social conditions it's still worth it. reply ink_13 16 hours agorootparentprevThere is a quite vocal handful of commenters who loathe the public education system (although perhaps not for the reasons one might initially expect) reply ziml77 15 hours agorootparentThe reason I would expect is that they think the teachers are showing their kids explicit sexual content, encouraging them to be transgender, and telling them about how they should hate America and white people.

Say somebody comes up to you and says hey, nice jacket. Would you like to sell it to me for $5,000? You bought the jacket for $500, and it was mass produced and you can just buy another one with that money. sounds like a great deal! But if I add that we're in Boston and it's winter and we're outside, miles from shelter, and it's snowing. Suddenly, sellling your winter coat is a way worse idea and not worth making $4,950. Americans have long held this belief that prices are prices. If I buy a can of beans, it should be the same price if you buy the can of beans instead of me. But in reality, prices are totally made up. Hopefully the price of something is greater than it cost to make it, along with all the other expenses, so the business can remain open and continue, but businesses that go out of business have to sell their items at a loss. Which makes their inventory worth exactly as much as people are willing to pay, usually at a discount. Sure, he wanted a better deal, but there's only one Twitter, and it's his (plus a bunch of investors and Fidelity). He didn't overpay for anything, he gets to run it how he wants, now that it's his. reply ZeroGravitas 3 hours agorootparentIf you have to sue the person offering you 5K for your jacket to ensure they fulfil the deal, it's fair to speculate that even they thought they'd paid too much. reply constGard 17 hours agorootparentprevMy favorite pet theory is that Musk taking over Twitter is to disentangle the bureaucratic and journalistic class from the direct Tumblr/4chan content pipeline they've all been drinking from for years.

Aven is one of Putin's oldest friends. Putin would be in prison instead of becoming president without him. Aven covered for Vladimir Putin in 1992, when he organized an illegal trade in export licenses; he was also present at a meeting with Putin on February 24, 2022, in the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. He did not express any protest against \"SVO\" and supported Putin. By the way, he, together with Fridman, is trying to lift sanctions from himself, just yesterday he received another refusal in this matter. In the purchase of Twitter he is represented by the company \"8VC Opportunities Fund II, LP\", where his son Denis works. > Vadim Moshkovich is a sanctioned Russian agricultural billionaire who was a member of the \"Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation.\" In other words, he was officially part of Putin's inner circle. Moshkovich owns Russia's largest agricultural holding, Rusagro. Naturally, he was also present at the meeting with Putin on February 24, 2022, and, like Aven, did not express any protest against Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In the purchase of Twitter he is represented by the company \"8VC Opportunities Fund II, LP\", where his son Jack (Eugene) works. > Knowing all this, we now understand Elon Musk's bias. Everyone was wondering how it was possible that Twitter shares (X) were falling, advertisers were breaking contracts, and no one was doing anything. This was direct damage to investors.

    "originBody": "JS Dates Are About to Be Fixed August 20, 2024 · 10 min read Iago Lastra CofounderTimeTime.in The problem Of all the recent changes coming to ECMAScript, my favorite by far is the Temporal proposal. This proposal is very advanced, and we can already use this API through the polyfill provided by the FullCalendar team. This API is so incredible that I will likely dedicate several blog posts to highlighting its key features. However, in this first post, I will focus on explaining one of its main advantages: we finally have a native object to represent a \"Zoned Date Time\". But... What is a \"Zoned Date Time\"? Human dates vs JS dates Well, when we talk about human dates, we usually say something like, \"I have a doctor's appointment on August 4th, 2024, at 10:30 AM,\" but we omit the time zone. This omission makes sense because, generally, our interlocutor knows us and understands that when I talk about dates, I usually do so in the context of my time zone, Europe/Madrid. Unfortunately, with computers, this is not the case. When we work with \"Date\" objects in JavaScript we are dealing with plain numbers. If we read the official specification, it states: \"An ECMAScript time value is a Number, either a finite integral Number representing an instant in time to millisecond precision or NaN representing no specific instant\" Aside from the VERY IMPORTANT fact that dates in JavaScript are not UTC but POSIX, where leap seconds are completely ignored, the problem with having only numbers is that the original semantics of the date are lost. This is becaus given an human date we can get the equivalent js date but not the other way arround. Let's consider an example: suppose I want to record the moment I make a payment with my card. Many people might be tempted to do something like this: const paymentDate = new Date('2024-07-20T10:30:00'); Since my browser is on an CET timezone, when I write this the browser just \"computes the number of milliseconds since the EPOX given this CET instant\" This is what we actually store in a date: paymentDate.getTime(); // 1721464200000 This means that depending on how you read this information you will get a different \"human date\": If we read this from the CET perspective I get 10:30: d.toLocaleString() // '20/07/2024, 10:30:00' and if we read this from the ISO perspective we get 8:30: d.toISOString() // '2024-07-20T08:30:00.000Z' Many people think that by working with UTC or communicating dates in ISO format, they are safe; however, this is not correct, as information is still lost. UTC is not enough Even when working with dates on an ISO format, including the offset, the next time we want to display that date, we only know the number of milliseconds that have passed since the UNIX epoch and the offset. But this is still not enough to know the human moment and time zone in which the payment was made. Strictly speaking, given a timestamp t0, we can obtain n human-readable dates that represent it... In other words, the function responsible for transforming a timestamp into a human-readable date is not injective, as each element of the set of timestamps corresponds to more than one element of the \"human dates\" set. This happens in exactly the same way when storing ISO dates, as timestamps and ISO are two representations of the same instant: And this also happens if you work with offsets because different timezones might have the same offset. If you still don't see the problem clearly, let me illustrate it with an example. Imagine you live in Madrid and take a trip to Sydney. A few weeks later, you return to Madrid and see a charge on your transaction statement that you don't recognize... a charge of 3.50 at 2 AM on the 16th? What was I doing? That night I went to bed early!... I don't understand. After a while of being worried, you realize that the charge corresponds to the coffee you had the following morning since, as you've read this article, you've deduced that your bank stores all transactions in UTC, and the application translates them to the phone's time zone. This may end up as an anecdote, but what if your bank applies a promotion of one free cash withdrawal per day? When does that day start and end? UTC? Australia?... Things get complicated, believe me... At this point, I hope you're convinced that working with only timestamps is a problem that, fortunately, now has a solution. ZonedDateTime In addition to many other things, the new Temporal API introduces a Temporal.ZonedDateTime object specifically designed to represent dates and times with their corresponding time zone. They have also proposed an extension to RFC 3339 to standardize the serialization and deserialization of strings representing dates: As an example: 1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00[America/Los_Angeles] This string represents 39 minutes and 57 seconds after the 16th hour of December 19, 1996, with an offset of -08:00 from UTC, and additionally specifies the human time zone associated with it (\"Pacific Time\") for time-zone-aware applications to take into account. Additionally, this API allows working with different calendars such as: buddhist chinese coptic dangi ethioaa ethiopic gregory hebrew indian islamic islamic-umalqura islamic-tbla islamic-civil islamic-rgsa japanese persian roc Among all these, the most common will be iso8601 (the standard adaptation of the Gregorian calendar) with which you will work most frequently. Basic operations Creating Dates The Temporal API offers a significant advantage when creating dates, particularly with its Temporal.ZonedDateTime object. One of the standout features is its ability to effortlessly handle time zones, including those tricky situations involving Daylight Saving Time (DST). For example, when you create a Temporal.ZonedDateTime object like this: const zonedDateTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({ year: 2024, month: 8, day: 16, hour: 12, minute: 30, second: 0, timeZone: 'Europe/Madrid' }); You’re not just setting a date and time; you're ensuring that this date is accurately represented within the specified time zone. This precision means that regardless of DST changes or any other local time adjustments, your date will always reflect the correct moment in time. This feature is especially powerful when scheduling events or logging actions that need to be consistent across different regions. By incorporating the time zone directly into the date creation process, Temporal eliminates the common pitfalls of working with traditional Date objects, such as unexpected shifts in time due to DST or time zone differences. This makes Temporal not just a convenience but a necessity for modern web development where global time consistency is crucial. If you are curious about why this API is great read this article explaining how to deal with changes on Time Zone definitions. Comparing dates ZonedDateTime offers an static method named compare which given 2 ZonedDateTimes one and two will return: −1 if one is less than two 0 if the two instances describe the same exact instant, ignoring the time zone and calendar 1 if one is greater than two. You can easily compare dates on unusual cases like the repeated clock hour after DST ends, values that are later in the real world can be earlier in clock time, or vice versa: const one = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2020-11-01T01:45-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]'); const two = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2020-11-01T01:15-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]'); Temporal.ZonedDateTime.compare(one, two); // => -1 // (because `one` is earlier in the real world) Cool built-ins A ZonedDateTime has some precomputed attributes that will make your life easier, for example: hoursInDay The hoursInDay read-only property returns the number of real-world hours between the start of the current day (usually midnight) in zonedDateTime.timeZone to the start of the next calendar day in the same time zone. Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2020-01-01T12:00-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]').hoursInDay; // => 24 // (normal day) Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2020-03-08T12:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]').hoursInDay; // => 23 // (DST starts on this day) Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2020-11-01T12:00-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]').hoursInDay; // => 25 // (DST ends on this day) Another cool attributes are daysInYear, inLeapYear Transforming timezones ZonedDateTimes offer a .withTimeZone method which allows to change a ZonedDateTime as we desire: zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('1995-12-07T03:24:30+09:00[Asia/Tokyo]'); zdt.toString(); // => '1995-12-07T03:24:30+09:00[Asia/Tokyo]' zdt.withTimeZone('Africa/Accra').toString(); // => '1995-12-06T18:24:30+00:00[Africa/Accra]' Basic arithmetics We can use the .add method to add the date portion of a duration using calendar arithmetics. The result will automatically adjust for Daylight Saving Time using the rules of this instance's timeZone field. The GREAT PART of this is that it supports playing with calendar arithmetics or plain durations. Adding or subtracting days should keep clock time consistent across DST transitions. For example, if you have an appointment on Saturday at 1:00PM and you ask to reschedule it 1 day later, you would expect the reschedule appointment to still be at 1:00PM, even if there was a DST transition overnight. Adding or subtracting the time portion of a duration should ignore DST transitions. For example, a friend you've asked to meet in in 2 hours will be annoyed if you show up 1 hour or 3 hours later. There should be a consistent and relatively-unsurprising order of operations. If results are at or near a DST transition, ambiguities should be handled automatically (no crashing) and deterministically. zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2020-03-08T00:00-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]'); // Add a day to get midnight on the day after DST starts laterDay = zdt.add({ days: 1 }); // => 2020-03-09T00:00:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles] // Note that the new offset is different, indicating the result is adjusted for DST. laterDay.since(zdt, { largestUnit: 'hour' }).hours; // => 23 // because one clock hour lost to DST laterHours = zdt.add({ hours: 24 }); // => 2020-03-09T01:00:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles] // Adding time units doesn't adjust for DST. Result is 1:00AM: 24 real-world // hours later because a clock hour was skipped by DST. laterHours.since(zdt, { largestUnit: 'hour' }).hours; // => 24 Computing differences between dates. Temporal offers a method named .until which computes the difference between the two times represented by zonedDateTime and other, optionally rounds it, and returns it as a Temporal.Duration object. If other is earlier than zonedDateTime then the resulting duration will be negative. If using the default options, adding the returned Temporal.Duration to zonedDateTime will yield other. This might look like an obvious operation but I encourage you to read the full spec to understand the nuances of it. Conclusion The Temporal API represents a revolutionary shift in how time is handled in JavaScript, making it one of the few languages that address this issue comprehensively. In this article, we've only scratched the surface by discussing the difference between human-readable dates (or wall clock time) and UTC dates, and how the Temporal.ZonedDateTime object can be used to accurately represent the former. In future articles, we'll explore other fascinating objects such as Instant, PlainDate, and Duration. I hope you enjoyed this introduction. Happy coding! :)",

I feel like we peaked somewhere around the mid 2010s with regards to web compatibility: No more Flash, but also more than just 1.5 rendering engines. Before that, it was all \"oh, sorry, Windows .exe only\"; since then, \"sorry, Chrome visitors only\". reply marcosdumay 44 minutes agorootparentprevThe JS spec requires that std-libraries decode 8 US timezones and no further? reply saurik 37 minutes agorootparentprev> It's more about the javascript spec. I don't think this is correct. I think the JavaScript spec here defines a string format which is extremely narrow, but then leaves it open to browsers implementing whatever they want. https://262.ecma-international.org/5.1/#sec-15.9.4.2 > The function first attempts to parse the format of the String according to the rules called out in Date Time String Format (15.9.1.15). If the String does not conform to that format the function may fall back to any implementation-specific heuristics or implementation-specific date formats. https://262.ecma-international.org/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15 > ECMAScript defines a string interchange format for date-times based upon a simplification of the ISO 8601 Extended Format. The format is as follows: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ > Z is the time zone offset specified as “Z” (for UTC) or either “+” or “-” followed by a time expression HH:mm > Note2: There exists no international standard that specifies abbreviations for civil time zones like CET, EST, etc. and sometimes the same abbreviation is even used for two very different time zones. For this reason, ISO 8601 and this format specifies numeric representations of date and time. The hint as to what is going on then comes from MDN, which more documents the ground truth than the goal. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Refe... > There are many ways to format a date as a string. The JavaScript specification only specifies one format to be universally supported: the date time string format, a simplification of the ISO 8601 calendar date extended format. The format is as follows: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ > Note: You are encouraged to make sure your input conforms to the date time string format above for maximum compatibility, because support for other formats is not guaranteed. However, there are some formats that are supported in all major implementations — like RFC 2822 format — in which case their usage can be acceptable. Always conduct cross-browser tests to ensure your code works in all target browsers. A library can help if many different formats are to be accommodated. That table then comes from RFC2822, which also doesn't want you to use string named time zones, but as RFC822 has such it needs to still support it a bit--I imagine this probably came from back when this was used by ARPA-- and so has a section on \"obsolete\" date and time format extensions, which only explicitly requires support for US time zones and (notably) military formats. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822#section-4.3 \"UT\" / \"GMT\" / ; Universal Time ; North American UT ; offsets \"EST\" / \"EDT\" / ; Eastern: - 5/ - 4 \"CST\" / \"CDT\" / ; Central: - 6/ - 5 \"MST\" / \"MDT\" / ; Mountain: - 7/ - 6 \"PST\" / \"PDT\" / ; Pacific: - 8/ - 7 %d65-73 / ; Military zones - \"A\" %d75-90 / ; through \"I\" and \"K\" %d97-105 / ; through \"Z\", both %d107-122 ; upper and lower case > Other multi-character (usually between 3 and 5) alphabetic time zones have been used in Internet messages. Any such time zone whose meaning is not known SHOULD be considered equivalent to \"-0000\" unless there is out-of-band information confirming their meaning. So, a spec, sure, but not the JavaScript spec, and not because if Chrome supported something weird then JS would get mad (as JS nigh unto suggests going above and beyond), and even RFC2822 (itself already outside JS) leaves open the door for more zones... in practice, I actually think JavaScriptCore might support even more formats (but could be totally wrong on that)? reply the__alchemist 4 minutes agoprevThank god. Javascript is the only language where I... wait for it... roll my own datetimes. Moment's central failure, beyond the surprise mutability, is the conflation of Dates and Times with Datetimes. They are not the same, and this causes so many problems. Python's Arrow library made the same mistake, likely inspired by Moment. I've heard JS devs insist that Dates and Times have no place as standalone constructs outside of a Datetime, but this is incompatible with practical use cases. Rust's Chrono? Outstanding. You can find flaws, but it's generally predictable, and most importantly, has fewer flaws than those in other languages. Python's? Kind of messy, but usable. JS's Date and Moment? Unusable. reply wging 1 hour agoprev> In other words, the function responsible for transforming a timestamp into a human-readable date is not injective, as each element of the set of timestamps corresponds to more than one element of the \"human dates\" set. The author confuses the concept of injectivity and well-definedness. For an injective function f, it has to be true that given distinct a and b, f(a) != f(b). That's not the problem here; rather the problem is that for a timestamp t there's no unique human-readable date x such that f(t) = x. That's well-definedness, not injectivity. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined_expression You could talk about the inverse function, from human-readable dates to timestamps, and correctly point out that that function is not injective, because more than one human-readable date maps to the same timestamp... reply et1337 1 hour agoprevI think this might be one of those “difficulty curve” memes.

Time zone awareness!” On the right, the Jedi master: “just use UTC timestamps”. reply happytoexplain 1 hour agoparentNo - the master's answer is that you use one or the other depending on whether you are representing absolute time or clock/calendar time. The expertise lies in understanding the difference between those two things, which one your use case falls into, and how to ensure other developers and the very APIs provided by your platform do not make silent assumptions about that decision. Often it feels like you can \"just use UTC\" because it's hard to imagine the fail states, and APIs often make tz assumptions for you so you may never notice those fail states (occasionally your software will just be buggy and annoy a user, decreasing the feeling of quality and trust - it may never result in a disaster). reply SoftTalker 8 minutes agorootparentAnd even then it's difficult. Time zone definitions change. Summer time does not start and end on the same date everywhere. So you also might need to know the UTC offset corresponding to the time at that time not just the UTC offset of that time zone today.

The front-end devs were using moment.js which didn't know about the previous start/end dates. These days I try to encode everything that is logically a date as yyyy-mm-dd.

It’s okay to apply the perpetual Gregorian calendar both into the past and the future by default. It probably won’t last more than a couple thousand years into the future as well, considering Earth’s decelerating rotation. reply RandomThoughts3 1 hour agorootparentprevTechnically you could use TAI for most things internally and use an offset when you display. It works perfectly for records. The only issue is with scheduled things when your users probably want to point at something in their timezone. reply ikekkdcjkfke 24 minutes agorootparentOr toLocalDisplayString(TAI timestamp). It seems like timezones and their rules change over time and geographic location, using todays rules to show dates back in time with previous rules would be broken right? reply jitl 2 minutes agorootparentWell, any correct time handling library will use something like the IANA timezone database (aka tz/tzdb/zoneinfo) which stores all the changes in timezone rules for localities over the years - a library that only knows \"today's rules\" would be fundamentally broken as you say. So the internals of toLocalDisplayString(timestamp, timezone, calendar, locale) should look up the appropriate rules in effect at the timestamp and use those to decide the local time to display. labster 35 minutes agorootparentprevThe main problem is that future values of TAI converted into most time zones is nondeterministic. On the other hand, at least you can guarantee all TAI seconds will actually occur. reply lexicality 18 minutes agoparentprevDates of past events are always UTC, dates of future physical events must always be a timestamp and a location, dates of future virtual events are either UTC or location based depending on how virtual they actually are. I can tell you from bitter experience that if you have an event where a person has to arrive at a place at a time and you store that as UTC instead of wall clock, you will have a problem at some point reply mirekrusin 9 minutes agorootparentPast/future doesn't matter, what matters is context. You don't need to use timezones for ie. setTimeout even though it refers to the future and you should have timezone available for past events ie. atm withdrawal. reply marshmellman 1 minute agorootparentsetTimeout takes a duration in ms, not a timestamp. If it did take a timestamp, I think you would need to pass it a timezone to disambiguate. Maybe a better argument is, “when you’re setting a phone alarm, you don’t tell it a timezone.” Maybe the distinction is whether the timezone is established at write time or read time. reply lxgr 4 minutes agoparentprev> the Jedi master: “just use UTC timestamps”. That poor Jedi master is going to miss the recurring workgroup meeting at least twice per year though, after either DST switch :) reply gvkhna 1 hour agoparentprevYes that works for most use cases but there are use cases where you may need to store or shuttle the time zone. For instance you want to know this UTC timestamp was originally created in PDT. You would have to store two variables. Most other languages have this functionality it can be useful and is good to have, probably only needed by Jedi’s too. reply nafey 1 hour agorootparentI have always wondered why breaking the timestamp (in UTC) and the timezone into two separate data points and storing both is not the accepted solution. It appears like the cleanest solution to me. reply moqmar 49 minutes agorootparentTwo different implementations might make two different local times out of that, e.g. due to not being aware of changing DST/timezone policies. Hence the recommendation of separating between user/clock/calendar time (which must be exact to a human) and absolute/relative timestamps (which must be exact to a computer). reply tisdadd 1 hour agorootparentprevFrom my experience, it certainly is.

Google Photos also get confused with \"When was this picture taken?\", my older model camera just stores the EXIF date in \"local time\" and I have to remember to change its timezone when travelling, and if GPhotos can't figure it out, it might show pictures out of the airplane window, and then the next series of pictures are from the departure airport because they're from a \"later\" hour (since it's missing the timezone info). I suppose I could keep it at my home time or UTC... reply mminer237 32 minutes agorootparentThat is how I would expect a bank statement to read though. I would find it infinitely more confusing if I bought something online in my bank showed the time of wherever the seller was located. The photos problem is harder, but the app needs to just convert it from local time to UTC when you import it. There's not much that can be done if you take photos on a camera with a different time zone than you're in without more metadata. reply netsharc 26 minutes agorootparentYeah, these are workarounds we have to use because many pieces of software weren't implemented fully... reply closewith 1 hour agorootparentprevYou can make the same meme about this use case, too.

While “instant” arguably can mean a precise point in time (“in that very instant”), the primary dictionary definition is a (very small) time interval. This is also reflected in the meaning of “instantly”, which does not mean “simultaneously” or “at the same point in time”, but rather something like “immediately after”. Similarly for the adjective “instant”, which likewise generally implies a chronological succession, however short. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it instinctively feels off to me to use it to denote timestamps. reply paxys 1 hour agoprevHaving a good datetime standard is half the battle. The other (more difficult) half is getting broad adoption for it. If it was just a matter of computing within the bounds of my application then there are a bunch of great libraries that make this stuff easy already. However now the question is - if I pass an encoded ZonedDateTime object from my browser/server to a third party, will it be able to interpret it? Realistically I'm just going to convert it down to an ISO string or unix TS as always just to be safe, thus going back to the exact same problem. reply prmph 23 minutes agoprevGood, I also used to think storing timestamps in UTC was sufficient. The examples really explained the problems with that well. One other issue to note is that, if you store dates in UTC, now the fact that they are in UTC is a tacit assumption, probably not recorded anywhere except in organizational memory. So the new API will be a very welcome addition to the JS standard library. However, and this is probably a bit off-topic, why are the ECMAScript guys not also addressing the fundamental reasons why JS continues to be somewhat a joke of a language? - Where are decimals, to avoid things like `parseInt(0.00000051) === 5`? - Why are inbuilt globals allowed to be modified? The other day a 3rd-party lib I was using modified the global String class, and hence when I attempted to extend it with some new methods, it clashed with that modification, and it took me and hour or two to figure out (in TS, no less). - Why can't we have basic types? Error/null handling are still haphazard things. Shouldn't Result and Maybe types be a good start towards addressing those? reply troupo 10 minutes agoparent> Why are inbuilt globals allowed to be modified?

Imagine if after selecting the fall back day, it saw the transition and let you pick a time during the extra hour. If after selecting the spring forward day, it wouldn't let you pick a time during the hour that doesn't exist. Today that doesn't work because everyone uses different crappy third-party libraries and mui functions on top of a lowest-common adapter that certainly doesn't do stuff like \"show me the DST transitions in this day\". This stuff matters sometimes; a user of my NVR wanted to save a clip during the fall back hour and got the wrong result because these things just don't work right today. https://github.com/scottlamb/moonfire-nvr/issues/244 reply ta8645 17 minutes agoprevThis is a step in the right direction, but it really needs to be supported everywhere so that there isn't friction when crossing into Javascript, and out to a database or other language.

During my school years, it was evident to me that for some kids math was easy, and for others like myself: painfully difficult. This belief shadowed me for years, a constant reminder that while believe I am smart… I’m not THAT smart. Recently, after 150 days immersed in learning math, I had a stark realization. The struggle wasn’t because I wasn’t capable, but rather, I was simply missing a shit-ton of pre-requisite knowledge. It’s like trying to defeat a Elden Ring boss… at level 1. It’s like walking into a movie halfway through—you can’t understand the plot because you missed the beginning. The same goes for learning complex subjects like math, CS, whatever. The gap in comprehension wasn’t due to a lack of ability but rather a gap in prerequisite knowledge. So here’s a gentle reminder: You’re not dumb—you just might not have all the prerequisites yet. Building from the Ground Up Realizing this, I decided to rebuild my math skills from the ground up. I revisited the basics I had glossed over or misunderstood in the past. Going further back in my material, picking better learning methods and practicing like hell. This process was slow, often humbling, but it was necessary. Each foundational concept I mastered laid the groundwork for more complex theories and problems. Have I turned THAT smart yet? Hell no. In fact, I’m still pretty dumb. But I’m slowly getting there.",

As someone who was the “smart kid” growing up, going to the university without good work ethic was pretty eye opening, no longer being able to coast on intuitively getting subjects, but rather either having to put in a bunch of effort while feeling both humbled and dumb at times, or just having to sink academically. Even after getting through that more or less successfully and having an okay career so far, I still definitely struggle with both physical health and mental health, both of which make the process of learning new things harder and slower than just drinking a caffeinated beverage of choice and grokking a subject over a long weekend. Sometimes it feels like trying to push a rock up a muddy slope. And if I’m struggling, as someone who’s not burdened by having children to take care of or even not having the most demanding job or hours to make ends meet, I have no idea how others manage to have a curious mind and succeed the way they do. Admittedly, some people just feel like they’re built different. Even if I didn’t have those things slowing me down as much (working on it), I’d still be nowhere near as cool as people who dive headfirst into low level programming, electrical engineering, write their own simulations, rendering or even whole game engines and such. Maybe I’m just exposed to what some brilliant people can do thanks to the Internet, but some just manage to do amazing things. reply nuancebydefault 54 minutes agoparentThis seems to be a story of a kind that shows up regularly at HN. People who are smart in several ways but because they cannot do what some other (1 out of 10000) people-with-or-without-children can, they don't feel smart and are a bit frustrated by it. Those others make a 'tutorial for creating a raytracer from scratch in a weekend', invent a format for a binary that runs as-is on several processor architectures, or are maintaining parts of the linux kernel. I easily recognize such stories, perhaps because that story might apply to myself as well. This unfulfillment treat applies to this post as well as the writer of the article (the writer indicated that before his 150 day submersion he felt a bit dumb at mathematics). The thing I want to bring across is now... we should not strive for such capability. There are many things to learn and ways to grow as a person, why beat ourselves up for not being very good at this or that particular thing? reply nsxwolf 7 minutes agorootparentWell, we let kids believe they’re just not good at math, and tell them that’s ok I’m sure you’re good at other things, and they believe it, and wish we’d stop doing that. reply nuancebydefault 3 minutes agorootparentWhile they are not studying maths, they can grow and improve themselves in other ways, not? reply vundercind 2 hours agoparentprev> As someone who was the “smart kid” growing up, going to the university without good work ethic was pretty eye opening, no longer being able to coast on intuitively getting subjects, but rather either having to put in a bunch of effort while feeling both humbled and dumb at times, or just having to sink academically. Modern gifted education is very aware of this and is working on fixing that. How effectively, I dunno, probably not very, but at least it’s a hot topic in the field this century. Damn near every person I’ve know who was “gifted” has a similar story, myself included. There’s a lot of lost potential because we badly mis-handle those kids for years and years on end. reply dsign 2 hours agorootparentI thought that I was gifted, but in retrospect, maybe I wasn't. I couldn't play any games well; not the physical ones, not computer games, not card or board games. The other kids would get them fast, while I was always dumbfounded and it took me a long time to grasp the rules. Once, it became popular to play Warcraft in my circle of friends and, try hard as I may, I was the rag they mopped the floor with :-) . But math, physics and computer sciences were another story, because growing up I didn't have anything more interesting to do than reading and solving exercises from old soviet textbooks. So, I think I wasn't gifted, or just gifted by serendipity. reply novok 1 hour agorootparentYou might have certain targeted deficiencies that make processing those things well difficult. Like I have a hard time finding things in visual space, so I'm not good at jigsaw puzzles. I have slower reaction times & processing speeds also which makes me not as good at video games as I should be combined with the visual space deficiencies. When a shit ton of stuff is happening on screen I lose my place, while others might be able to manage it. But I also show an ability to think and learn deeply and score very well on symbolic and verbal intelligence, I also connect the dots very well and show a lot of skip thinking behavior. I call my brain a high torque, low RPM engine. Also you might not like anything that is 'competitive', so your brain shuts down in avoidance / disinterest. Or you might think deeply about everything, so it always takes you a while at first, but once you grasp it you grasp it at a deep level unlike others. reply Jensson 1 hour agorootparentprevSymbolic manipulation and intuitive understanding doesn't seem to be very correlated to me. I've met people who are very good at manipulating symbols, but they aren't very good at understanding less formal things like strategy games well, they tend to invent way too rigid rules for themselves and lose since they are bad at adapting. So maybe you are very smart with symbols, but less so with intuitive understanding? There is nothing wrong with that, makes it easier to decide what to work on, focus on your strengths and let others cover for your weaknesses. reply lamontcg 58 minutes agorootparentMy memory is kinda shit. So when I was in the gifted program, they got real concerned about how I didn't know my times tables and was super slow at a few of them. This was the 1970s, and before I knew binary, so 7s and 8s caused me issues. So I'd figure out 8x8 by going from 6x6=36 (real easy to memorize) and then adding +6+6 to mentally fill out the 8x6 block and then adding +8+8 to fill it out to a 8x8 block (I'm visual/geometrical). I was the first kid in school to pass the AHSME to get invited to take the AIME though. Being before the internet, and being stuck on an island in Alaska, didn't get me enough exposure to higher math through my own self-direction to get anywhere on the AIME. If you don't live anywhere near a University library and/or don't know you can use it, that'll set you behind (at least back then, these days there's YouTube and sci-hub and friends). I still think I would have hit a wall anyway with Math, even with perfect exposure, because I'm visual and higher Math seems to require being very good with symbols and memory as well. I suspect lots of people still underestimate me because my memory is ass, and we associate memory with intelligence so much (e.g. Jeopardy). reply wenc 1 hour agoparentprevAlso gifted child here, but grew up with parents who drilled into me that \"effort matters, you might not be the best, but with effort you can be better than who you were yesterday and that is a worthy endeavor\" It's just a slight switch of mindset, but that small switch carried me through times when subjects got too hard and when I wanted to give up because I felt I wasn't talented enough. I knew so many gifted kids who got perfect scores in college freshman year (engineering) but started giving up when things didn't come as easily to them. They all ended up leading mediocre lives after. I wasn't as smart as them but I knew I could always do better if I tried harder (even though the ROI wasn't great at first). So I just kept grinding (16 hour days studying). My GPA rose very gradually until eventually I finished with a not-great but respectable 3.6 (the 3.4-3.7 range is typically attained by folks who maybe didn't have natural talent but worked hard). That GPA got me into grad school where I got to study what I loved (way fewer exams, more research). Carol Dweck wrote a book on \"growth mindset\" that talks about this. You don't have to read the book, but the idea of growth mindset, though simple, has been really transformative in my life. reply novok 59 minutes agorootparentSometimes the greatest gift you can give a gifted kid is failing early at something they want, so they learn the grit to achieve it. reply wenc 14 minutes agorootparentAbsolutely.

This is mainly because of 2 reasons: 1. Things actually get more complicated 2. Most of your \"teachers\" know a lot less about teaching than your school teachers, because they never had formal training in teaching. However, there are some lecturers who are natural talents. The second point is why you have to do more work to actually learn a topic. Your lecturer won't meet you halfway, but you have to get a lot closer to them to grasp their explanations. reply casebash 2 hours agoprevJust thought I'd add a comment as someone who came top of the state in my grade in multiple olympiad competitions: I always felt that a large part of my advantage came from having a strong understanding of maths from the ground up. I felt that a lot more people could have gained the same level of understanding as I did if they had been willing to work hard enough, but I also felt that almost no-one would, because it'd be an incredibly hard sell to convince someone to engage in years-long project where they'd go all the way back to kindergarten and rebuild their knowledge from the ground up. In other words, excellence is often the accumulation of small advantages over time. reply novok 57 minutes agoparentI think mathematics education is pretty horrible this way. You only start actually learning the foundations of math in your 3rd or 4th year of undergrad.

I got good grades because a teacher let us repeat a task like \"write a report\" seven-fourteen times. The feedback was given by him in class highlighting the important points of getting a good grades, and then 24 hours after handing in the report we got it back with notes mentioning which important parts we had missed. This thought me the rather simple lesson that getting it right on the first try is really hard. Writing a book report is completely different from reading a book. I have heard people doing literature in university being sick of books because of the same issue. reply veunes 1 hour agoparentprevThe idea of starting from scratch and rebuilding one's knowledge, especially when it means going back to the basics, is daunting reply randcraw 1 hour agorootparentI think much of that 'daunt' comes from the lack of instructional resources needed to support a solo journey through higher math. Yes, there are some great illuminating sources (like Kahn Academy and 3blue1brown), but if you're embarking on an epic quest (like recapping a BA in math), the essential guidance needed for coherent and graceful passage through all the requisite concepts simply does not exist -- short of reading 20 HS and college textbooks, which will subject you to a maddening amount of redundancy while leaving many fundamental concepts underexplained.

But really that just shifts the burden of backfilling prerequisites to the student. reply nicf 2 hours agoprevI'm a tutor, mainly working with adults who want to learn proof-based math, and the message behind this post definitely lines up well with my experience! If you're the sort of person who's animated by the idea of learning math but finding it challenging, it's worth considering that you might be missing some knowledge or skills that you'd be able to develop just fine if you knew to focus on them. There definitely is such a thing as \"mathematical talent\", but (a) if you're really excited by math then there's a decent chance your limiting factor is knowledge rather than talent, and (b) there's plenty to appreciate in the subject regardless of how much of it you have. My students come to me at all different levels but if they have enough time and motivation to work on it they all learn a lot of math! There are also plenty of people in the world who just aren't that into this stuff, but that's not really the population I'm talking about --- unless they have to learn it for some reason, it probably doesn't bother them that much that they don't know a lot of math! And I imagine a good chunk (though probably not all) of this group could probably find something to like in the subject if it was presented in an appealing way. reply JustinSkycak 2 hours agoparent100% agree. What I typically tell people is \"your mathematical potential has a limit but it's likely higher than you think.\" Not everybody can learn every level of math, but most people can learn the basics. In practice, however, few people actually reach their full mathematical potential because they get knocked off course early on by factors such as missing foundations, ineffective practice habits, inability or unwillingness to engage in additional practice, or lack of motivation. (My comment here is basically the intro to a detailed article I wrote on the topic: https://www.justinmath.com/your-mathematical-potential-has-a...) reply randcraw 54 minutes agorootparentThat's an excellent essay. I especially liked this part: \" Active learning and deliberate practice will be covered in more depth in later posts, but below are some key points: - Effective learning is active, not passive. It is not effective to attempt to learn by passively watching videos, attending lectures, reading books, or re-reading notes. - Deliberate practice requires repeatedly practicing skills that are beyond one's repertoire. However, this tends to be more effortful and less enjoyable, which can mislead non-experts to practice within their level of comfort. - Classroom activities that are enjoyable, collaborative, and non-repetitive (such as group discussions and freeform/unstructured project-based or discovery learning) can sometimes be useful for increasing student motivation and softening the discomfort associated with deliberate practice -- but they are only supplements, not substitutes, for deliberate practice. - Deliberate practice must be a part of a consistent routine. The power of deliberate practice comes from compounding of incremental improvements over a longer period of time. It is not a \"quick fix\" like cramming before an exam. \" reply JustinSkycak 44 minutes agorootparentThanks! Yeah, I guess I should probably link to some of those later posts about active learning and deliberate practice in the article.

You're just working with different materials. Materials that require more time and effort to 'get', but once you get them they are just another tool at your disposal. I was similar to the author in that, throughout high school and undergrad, I presumed that the mind that could comprehend advanced math or do novel research (in any field) was truly unknowable. Like there was this x-factor they had that wasn't there for me. I've long enjoyed puzzle games (like The Witness or Stephen's Sausage Roll). It turns out that problem solving in non-trivial domains is never terribly different than problem solving in those games, or any other domain really. Like my brain isn't doing anything different than the usual tree-search algorithm that any chess player performs when they are projecting moves ahead into the future. Its just iterating on concepts that seem abstruse to most people. But at the end of the day, deep problem solving in math or AI research tends to be the same moving-shapes-around-in-my head that I would do if I was trying to move an awkwardly shaped couch through a narrow doorway. reply findthewords 3 hours agoprevMost people are of average intelligence.

Learning is like climbing a staircase, and what you have to realize is you can't skip steps. reply ocean_moist 2 hours agoparentI tend to slightly disagree. Some of my most valuable learning was taking on massive projects, and then just doing whatever I could to make it work. Of course, progress would be slow, and you'd need to chunk up the problem and take small steps, but it rarely felt like slowly building up or climbing a staircase. I think the trial by fire approach, just jumping into the deep end, is a much more effective way to learn. It's also more fun for me. reply pajeets 2 hours agorootparentI actually disagree with both of you. Programming is learning and the code is the side effect of what you have learned. If you jump at a large project but lack the fundamentals you are going to wasting energy on stuff you shouldn't be. Rather the best way to learn programming I find was to master the basics, memorize the most used routines and commands to avoid having to google it every time (ex. CSS) The problem now is we have LLM which kind of negate the need and we have lot of engineers who don't have good fundamental systems design. The other major issue is most of us engineers are scaling for a future that won't come. It's sufficient to squeeze ton of performance out of a single vertically scaled Postgres instance for example without the need to do exotic architectures. So prerequisites are important like in the article but less so now but the fundamentals and only learning what is needed is critical more than ever (ex. Kubernetes for a blog) reply akira2501 4 minutes agorootparentThe best way to learn programming is to read and understand other programs. It's a really fun field, and you can isolate yourself and get very deep into thought, and then enter an exceptionally rewarding period of cycling between work and learning.

It's also more fun for me. If people survive it this gets them past some substantial mental hurdles. People who take too long on the basics often get stuck in the beginner treadmill, not really progressing but getting better and better at those basics. Unfortunately, it's not perfect. Most of my colleagues who have taken this approach have deficient mental models of how computers work or are missing significant portions of background or fundamental knowledge.

Just analytically breaking down complex problems into pieces that are understandable. It's often faster to work top-down and turn unknown unknowns -> known unknowns -> known knowns. reply JustinSkycak 2 hours agoparentIt can definitely be helpful to take a top-down approach in planning out your overarching learning goals. However, the learning itself has to occur bottom-up. Especially in math. Math is a skill hierarchy, and if you cannot execute a lower-level skill consistently and accurately, you will not be able to build more advanced skills on top of it. reply MichaelNolan 1 hour agorootparentI think these conversations of top down vs bottom up, are frequently a case where people are talking past each other due to using different definitions, and having different goals. And I think this is especially common when one of the people is a software engineer, and the other is not. For software, the tooling and the abstractions are so powerful that you can make incredible software without knowing what's really happening under the surface. Imagine an \"abstraction ladder\", with each level building on the previous level. Frequently in software development, you only need to understand a single level n, and maybe a little of n-1, to make great software. So the advice of \"just jump in\" is often great advice because you're jumping into a \"shallow pool\". (P.S, I love the work you're doing with MathAcademy, though I wish there was discounted price for \"casual\" learners that only have an hour or two a month) reply JustinSkycak 56 minutes agorootparentAgree, it depends highly on goals. Using off-the-shelf ML/AI models (to make great software) requires far less background knowledge than implementing new models being introduced in papers, which in turn requires far less background knowledge than producing new models that improve upon the state-of-the-art. Thanks for the kind words about Math Academy! It's true that we focus on students who are trying to acquire math skills to the highest degree possible -- we teach math as if we were training a professional athlete or musician. We maximize learning efficiency in the sense that we minimize the amount of work required to learn math to the fullest extent. I realize that there are many learners who only want to devote an hour or two per month, but, at least right now, such learners would be better served elsewhere. It's a totally different optimization problem -- maximize surface-level coverage subject to some fixed, miniscule amount of work -- and as a result it would require different different curriculum and possibly different training techniques (or at least, differently calibrated techniques).

I focused my efforts on a handful of research papers on the frontier of my chosen field, even writing code to solve problems in these papers from day one. However, I soon realized I lacked many foundational prerequisites, making the first year exceptionally tough. What I should have done was spend 3-6 months dissecting the hell out of all the key research papers and books written on the subject, starting from the very basics (from my knowledge frontier) and working my way up (the bottom-up approach).” reply cultofmetatron 30 minutes agorootparentprevI would legit PAY for an app that managed dependencies for understanding a paper so that I could see the path I need to take to understand what I'm reading.

I always found it helpful to first have an overview, a mental map of sorts, of the high-level details, so that when I looked at the details later I could make connections and know where to \"put\" this knowledge relative to other things. With bottom up I always feel lost because I don't know what it's useful for, the relationships to other pieces of knowledge, etc. reply JustinSkycak 2 hours agorootparentIt can definitely be helpful to take a top-down approach in planning out your overarching learning goals. However, the learning itself has to occur bottom-up. Especially in math. Math is a skill hierarchy, and if you cannot execute a lower-level skill consistently and accurately, you will not be able to build more advanced skills on top of it. I wrote about this recently here if you're interested: https://www.justinmath.com/how-to-learn-machine-learning-top... reply SoftTalker 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's good to have a high level view of what your ultimate goals are, but if you are lacking too much foundational knowledge you can't even conceive of it.

Or good ones do, anyway. reply JustinSkycak 2 hours agoparentOne problem is that it's easy to think you know the prerequisites when in fact you don't. For instance, a student struggling in calculus may think they know algebra because they got a decent grade in algebra class, even though they struggle to solve a quadratic equation and they've forgotten how trig works. -- Maybe they got saved by grade inflation, or -- maybe they did learn these things but they've gotten so rusty that they need to effectively re-learn them again, or -- maybe they learned and still remember everything from their algebra class, but the class was watered-down and cherry-picked the simplest possible cases of problems within each topic (e.g., quadratic equation always has leading coefficient of 1 and is solvable via factoring) ... There's a million different ways that a student can look at a list of prerequisites and mistakenly think that they have learned them, especially if the prerequisites are listed as a handful of high-level categories as opposed to hundreds of granular atomic topics. reply eesmith 3 hours agoprevFrom Neal Stephenson's \"Cryptonomicon\", at https://archive.org/details/cryptonomicon0000step_b9v1/page/... : > “Shut up about Leibniz for a moment, Rudy, because look here: You—Rudy—and I are on a train, as it were, sitting in the dining car, having a nice conversation, and that train is being pulled along at a terrific clip by certain locomotives named The Bertrand Russell and Riemann and Euler and others.

You will learn much better and faster. reply pajeets 2 hours agoprevStreams of tears roll down my cheek as I write this because this article perfectly highlighted that it wasn't the laziness but rather what was causing it , mainly the lack of prerequisite fundamentals needed to thrive in math field. Had I known this my life trajectory would've been different instead of self loathing and inferiority complex I built up around something so innocently simple. The rush of epiphany and self-forgiveness that overwhelms me after all these years. I realize now that learning grade school math in French and then started to learning algebra and calculus in Japanese abruptly moving to an English speaking institution to continue math degree (which i abandoned for reasons in the article i realize now ) screwed me up big time because neither French nor Japanese nor English is my first language. For instance I would store numbers in French in my head and perform arithmetic in French but to do any sort of additional algebraic or calculus I would need to switch to Japanese internally and finally write out response in English. Learning the advanced topics in English was never going to work out, it was like building a castle on sand and the stones are made out of mud. I always thought I was too “dumb” to understand math. During my school years, it was evident to me that for some kids math was easy, and for others like myself: painfully difficult. This belief shadowed me for years, a constant reminder that while believe I am smart… I’m not THAT smart. Recently, after 150 days immersed in learning math, I had a stark realization. The struggle wasn’t because I wasn’t capable, but rather, I was simply missing a shit-ton of pre-requisite knowledge. I wish I could show this article and translate it into other languages. There are lot of young kids in schools who tell themselves they are dumb or lazy because they can't do well in math and sciences. God knows how many of us are walking around feeling inadequate or frustrated at ourselves because we convinced ourselves we are not worth it or capable when in reality its the prerequisites both conscious and subconscious, overt and covert we fail to realize as fundamental stepping stones to success. It might as well be that failure in startups or business ventures or relationships even also stem from this principle: that the fundamental prerequisites were not taught or caught early on (either due to environment, upringing, socioeconomic constraints) have solidified into bad habits, bad model of world, bad model of others that ultimately transpire into bad thoughts, bad words, bad actions and opposite outcomes of what we set out to accomplish. Going forward I must make it my mission to realize what fundamentals and prerequisites I do not have and instead of brute forcing and letting my ego ignore it, I have to put aside time to build those basic building blocks. A cathartic angst feels deep in me. Might be too late for me due to my age and I fear I will ignore my own writing here and others will too. It's truly sad that we are all realizing it this late and will forget whatever lessons were learned. I wish society and people would stop pointing fingers at people and rather realize build tolerance from the fact that not everybody gets to build the same prerequisites as humans cannot be the same, some are innately inclined to better at certain things while others are not. Equal outcomes is a failure in the making and schools need to stop and focus on helping students build prerequisites on their own schedule and pace. reply photochemsyn 2 hours agoprev [–] Intelligence is far too complex to be meaningfully described with a single number like IQ. Measures of physical capability don't suffer from this issue - a person might be strong, or they might be fast, and everyone knows that the power lifter and the marathon runner use wildly different training regimens to improve their abilities. If physical capabilities are highly trainable, up to some genetic limit that the vast majority of people never even get close to, then it seems that intelligence must work the same way - e.g. prodigious feats of memorization can be achieved via training regimes (memory palaces etc.), as can one's three-dimensional visualization skills (e.g. a chessboard layout, or rotating a platonic solid, etc.) or the ability to rapidly construct arguments using logic and reason - but we don't seem to be able to classify different areas of mental ability as easily as with physical abilities. Sadly, this is one of those politically difficult topics as the blank slatists and the genetic determinists (Lysenko vs. Galton) have tried to use all kinds of pseudoscience to support their ideological arguments, when the underlying point is just that training your mind is as beneficial as training your body, and everyone should do it at least to some extent. reply ninetyninenine 2 hours agoparent [–] However iq is the most correlated number in psychology.

    "originBody": "The Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) has designed a new type of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment that could significantly reduce the cost to produce 7nm and smaller semiconductors, and thus revolutionize the chip manufacturing supply chain. According to reports, the EUV equipment’s optical system is greatly simplified while power consumption is reduced by a factor of ten, raising the prospect of much cheaper advanced chip-making machines. If so, it could mark the end of ASML’s monopoly on EUV lithography, which would have serious implications for semiconductor manufacturers, investors and governments. Recall that US sanctions forbid the sale of EUV lithography equipment to China, making it much more difficult and expensive for Chinese companies to make semiconductors at 7nm and 5nm, and impossible at the 3nm node now in production at Taiwan’s TSMC and the 2nm and smaller nodes currently under development. AI processors, the low-power semiconductor devices used in smartphones, and the latest high-density memory chips are made using highly complex EUV lithography equipment that is expensive to maintain and consumes enormous amounts of power. OIST Professor Tsumoru Shintake says the invention is a breakthrough technology that can nearly completely solve these problems. OIST’s Tsumoru Shintake. Image: OIST LATEST STORIES Made in Korea: British boy band hopefuls face K-pop’s brutal regime WWII shows peril of Ukraine’s surprise attack on Kursk Democratic showdown puts Widodo, Prabowo on the backfoot To paraphrase OIST, this is how it works: In traditional optical systems such as cameras, telescopes and older lithography tools, the aperture and lenses are symmetric to the central axis – i.e., arranged in a straight line. This configuration enables high optical performance with minimal aberrations, resulting in high-quality images. However, this is not possible with extremely short-wave EUV light, which is absorbed by most materials and cannot travel through transparent lenses. For this reason, in EUV lithography systems, the light is directed using crescent-shaped mirrors that reflect the rays in an asymmetrical zigzag pattern. This method “sacrifices important optical properties and reduces the overall performance of the system,” according to OIST. To eliminate this problem, Professor Shintake aligned two axis-symmetric mirrors in a straight line and used a total of only four mirrors instead of ten. Because highly absorbent EUV light weakens by 40% with each reflection, only about 1% of the energy from the light source reaches the wafer when bounced off ten mirrors while more than 10% does when only four mirrors are used. This makes it possible to use a smaller EUV light source with only one-tenth the power. Over 20 years ago, Phil Ware, an American engineer working for Japan’s Canon, told a technology seminar at the Semicon West industry exhibition in San Francisco that the problem with EUV lithography was that its power consumption was measured in “HDEs – Hoover Dam Equivalents.” If Professor Shintake’s design works as intended, this problem may finally be solved. “Like the egg of Columbus, [it] may seem impossible at first glance, but once solved, it becomes very simple,” Shintake said about the problem of EUV power consumption. As for the projector that transfers the circuit pattern on the photomask to the silicon wafer, OIST’s design consists of only two reflective mirrors, like an astronomical telescope. “This configuration is unimaginably simple,” Shintake says, “given that conventional projectors require at least six reflective mirrors. This was made possible by carefully rethinking the aberration correction theory of optics.” Sign up for one of our free newsletters The Daily Report Start your day right with Asia Times' top stories AT Weekly Report A weekly roundup of Asia Times' most-read stories Sign up Furthermore, “the performance has been verified using optical simulation software and it is guaranteed to be sufficient for the production of advanced semiconductors.” Graphic: Tsumoru Shintake, OIST OIST has filed a patent application for the technology, which it first plans to demonstrate with a half-scale model. After proving the concept, it will be used to build a working EUV lithography system in cooperation with one or more Japanese corporate partners in 2026. If that all goes to plan, Japan’s global position in the geopolitically important semiconductor industry will be greatly enhanced. The most likely partner would be Nikon, which gave up on EUV lithography some 15 years ago due to technical difficulties and high costs but which still makes previous-generation deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems. Canon is also a potential partner but it is busy trying to commercialize nanoimprint lithography, a completely different technology that uses circuit pattern molds instead of optics.

Chinese universities and companies are working on particle accelerator based EUV sources [2]. Question is, will they be able to actually commercialize it before ASML manages to get improved versions of their current litho machines out the door? Commercialization of a technology like this can easily take 5-10 years, and ASML aren't twiddling their thumbs. Once the incumbent has a technology that is, say, 80-90% as good as the challenger, the big players will always choose them to minimize risks.

It's quite possible to use a linear accelerator to generate EUV to etch chips. It's been done as a test at SLAC.[1] But that approach was more expensive than AMSL's, since it needed a mile-long accelerator. There was a startup in Fremont, Lyncean Technologies, that had a 10 watt EUV source based on a small synchrotron.[2][3] They supposedly got to 10 watts. But that was too weak for EUV semiconductor work. They struggled for years to find a market, and went bankrupt in 2022. Here's the video of the equipment auction.[4] If, with this new optical system, only 20 watts are needed, that technology is worth reviving. Something YC might be interested in. An accelerator source is much cleaner than the laser tin-zapping thing AMSL uses. It's amazing that works as a commercial product. [1] https://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2014/39af88b9d637418d86614...

Majority of the chip fabrication market is 20nm, 28nm, and 40nm along with analog chips (60nm+).

Both will crack it eventually, but the order book for ASML's High NA EUV (3nm and below) is entirely Intel, Samsung, and the American fabs for TSMC for the next 3-4 years so by the time a competitor is ASML comparable, a significant subset of high end US and SK fabs will have transitioned to 3nm. reply Panzer04 5 hours agorootparentBut how much of the monetary value generation derives from small nodes?

The ongoing diffusion of specialized DUVL processes like 20nm, 28nm, and 40nm is another great example (US in the 2000s to TW/SK in the 2010s to CN in the late 2010s/early 2020s).

The original paper in Japanese claim to use only 4 mirrors to achieve the same results. Although this story only mentions >the EUV equipment’s optical system is greatly simplified 1. Japan isn't new to lithography. Both Canon and Nikon are in the market as well and eventually gave on EUV research and focuses on DUV. 2. Power consumption is reduced by a factor of ten is extremely important as modern EUV, and future High-NA EUV are insanely power hungry, with 30%+ of the raw cost of chip manufacturing goes to energy usage alone. And this isn't just TSMC but also NAND and DRAM maker as well. 3. ASML has something similar in the work as well. Although not to any extreme as factor of 10.

The older and cheaper models of the ASML EUV sources would be good enough for this system that needs a much smaller power for the EUV sources. The European partners of ASML are the only companies that could manufacture at this time the optical system. Nevertheless, it is likely that the patent owners would prefer to license it to Nikon, to create competition for ASML. Nikon should be able to make the optical system, but this could need a few years of development, unless Nikon already has a secret internal research project for making EUV mirrors. The most difficult problem remains the EUV source, even if a much simpler source than the current sources is good enough. It seems very unlikely that ASML would be willing to sell EUV sources separately to Nikon, providing components for competing systems. The only deal that seems possible would be if ASML accepted to sell some of their older models of EUV sources to Nikon, in exchange for receiving licenses for this new improved kind of EUV optical system, which will then be incorporated in all new EUV systems, regardless if they are made by ASML or Nikon. This would reduce the dependence on ASML and its partners, but ASML would still completely control the market of EUV sources, even if not also the market of complete lithography systems, like it does now. reply alephnerd 2 hours agorootparent> It seems very unlikely that ASML would be willing to sell EUV sources separately to Nikon Nikon's out of the EUVL game and doesn't plan on returning. They're reiterated this in just about every quarterly prospectus for years now. They're migrating to licensing whatever EUVL IP they had to other players. They've pivoted heavily to FPD Lithography (LCD, OLED, and potentially PV fabrication) - better margins, less political headache. reply edgineer 5 hours agoprev>7nm and smaller Ugh.

I've never designed an EUV system, and I guess that Shintake's team had to solve some materials or optical coating technology issues that allowed them to consider the simpler on axis design. Having worked on zig zag and on axis designs in the IR and VIS range, I can say that Shintake's design will be much (orders of magnitude?) easier to align and assemble. reply SMAAART 4 hours agoprevOuch!

[0] - https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11717 reply adrian_b 6 hours agoparentThe yield rate by itself is not very relevant. It also matters which are the energy and materials consumption, the occupied floor area and the acquisition and maintenance prices associated with that yield. When all those are small enough, it may be worthwhile to replace a big and expensive fast machine with many smaller and cheaper slow machines. reply alephnerd 6 hours agorootparentFair point! That said, 10% reduction in power is decent along with the reduction in mirrors, but it would still take some effort for an attempt like this to be cost competitive compared to licensing from ASML. reply adrian_b 3 hours agorootparentAs another poster has already said, the power is reduced 10 times, not by 10%. At such a power reduction, it should be possible to use a much smaller and cheaper EUV source, allowing the use of multiple lithography systems, or increase a lot the throughput achievable with the current EUV sources. I hope that they have modeled correctly the losses in the mirrors. Here the incidence angle of the EUV light on the mirrors is much closer to a right angle than in the ASML system. It is likely that this increases the absorption in the mirror in comparison with a mirror on which the light falls at an angle far from perpendicular, as used by ASML. EDIT: Unfortunately this paper might be a hoax. I have read the 2013 paper that they give as reference [2] and as the basis of the claim for the 10 times reduction in power losses. There the losses in the mirror are given only for incidence angles no greater than 21 degrees, very far from a perpendicular incidence. Moreover the data imply that at higher incidence angles the losses increase a lot. Therefore the system with 4 mirrors at high incidence angles will have much higher losses than a system with 10 mirrors at low incidence angles, unless better mirror materials were discovered in the future. So ASML must have analyzed this simple system and dismissed it as impossible to make with the known materials. reply alephnerd 2 hours agorootparent> Unfortunately this paper might be a hoax Not necessarily. It might just have performed at this peak capacity in ideal lab conditions. This would need to be reproduced, but like you pointed out ASML and Zeiss most likely tested this configuration out at some point in the last 25 years. That said, the English is very off on this paper - I did a re-read and it looks like they're proposing that they were able to cut the power down to 20W from 200W reply adrian_b 1 hour agorootparentTheir reference numbered [1] is a more recent book from 2020. In this book it is said even if EUV mirrors have typically very poor reflectance at high incidence angles, it has become possible to make mirrors with a 60% to 70% reflectance even for high incidence angles (without specifying how high). They have computed their power advantage using the 65% value which is a middle value between those from the book, so it is OK. However they have used the same value for the ASML mirrors, which use low incidence angles, so they may have a higher reflectance. So according to the book, their system should be feasible nowadays, but the actual improvement in light losses is unknown, because the losses in each mirror depend heavily on both the mirror construction and the light incidence angle, which are not taken into consideration in the paper. reply mlyle 4 hours agorootparentprev90% reduction in power. reply coliveira 5 hours agoparentprevFor a new technology, that is not important. Yield rate will improve as more engineering is applied by these companies. reply roenxi 7 hours agoprev [–] Will this attempt work out commercially? Maybe, maybe not. But more interesting here is the strategic situation beyond the currently understood tech. The US has made it clear that it sees semiconductors as a vector to attack power centres in Asia. Today it is China. Democracies are notoriously fickle, tomorrow it could be India, Japan, Korea or anyone really. There is a strategic need here to break the remaining European monopolies on equipment supply. For China the need is urgent but for all the Asian powers the need is real. Given the manufacturing powerhouse that the collective Asia represents, I expect they'll figure all these details out and become technologically independent at least on paper. They've had more than a century of experience in dealing with the west, the risks of the status quo are too obvious once the US is overtly exploiting it. reply legacynl 6 hours agoparent> Democracies are notoriously fickle, are they really though?

It's exactly authoritarian regimes that can turn on a dime, if the supreme leader feels like it. reply roenxi 5 hours agorootparent> At least in democracies things require oversight, debates and people are being held responsible. I'm scratching my head at this one. Why do you think they are doing those things if not because they are constantly re-evaluating their direction? If you're just going to keep doing the same thing over and over again there isn't much need for debate. The oversight and accountability mechanisms are all-weather good ideas, but typically the US is using them to constantly adjust and change policy responses. Compare that to somewhere more authoritarian where they can't change policies precisely because those 3 aspects are quite weak. They find their groove once and stick to it for decades, and anyone trying to shake things up gets mired in institutional inertia. Sure a supreme leader could force sudden change in theory, but why are they going to do that? He's got everything set up how he likes it and his view of the world fossilised maybe 10, 20 years ago. Democracies are absolute monsters. The moment they detect that their interests have changed they'll vote out the old mob, bring in a new one and do things differently.

The US was one of the key players who built China up to what it is today, for a significant chunk of the past century they were strategic partners against Russia. And it is worth remembering that post WWII the US was busy marginalising the Europeans, making sure Germany was prosperous but didn't execute an independent military resurgence and helpfully euthanising the British empire. There were enemies other than Russia and China over that period.

I'm not sure why Asia is a singled out here, sounds like one to trying to construe a racist motive when there is none. The aformentioned India, Japan & Korea aren't worried about USA, their primary concerns are China and their neighbours. China's explicit objective to control the entire supply chain places them at a direct conflict of interest with those countries.

But. I paid for it with my car 4 years ago, but I didn't actually get it until ~2 years ago, and even then, it's been fairly sketchy, and only getting a bit less sketchy with recent updates. I believed their initial claims about what was then simply called \"Autopilot\", and I'm kind of mad at myself for doing so. I'm also mad that FSD development has been switched to a new version of the autopilot hardware that my car doesn't have, and apparently can never be upgraded to. The irony is, I would at least consider a new Tesla, were it not for Elon's antics and interference in US politics. While he's still there, I will never buy another Tesla, and I won't keep this one when the warranty runs out, at the end of this year. reply irjustin 15 hours agoparentI love the basic autopilot for freeway stuff. It's fanstastic at it and basically NOTHING ELSE. I can't trust it not to do weird stuff any other time. When it does weird stuff on the freeway, it seems way less risky.

The 'self own' depends on the idea that one is selecting against their interests due to distaste for a given CEO. First, who are they to say this? Something not objectively the best must be evaluated to find where it lands. Merits aren't universal, this falls to the individual. You did well to get to this point in your post. Second, let's pause for a minute and think of how contrived this is. Outside of social media, how often does this happen? I get the feeling this is a distinctly Elon+Tesla problem. However, we can't completely separate the man from the companies. The \"boots theory\" talks about how it costs more to be poor, many cheap boots instead of a more expensive pair. This tries to explain some counter-intuitive decisions people have to make. In this light, maybe people rank their opinions over dubious features in an overpriced appliance.

They’ll retake it at the current pace, but it takes time. Part of the reason why it isn’t discussed though is 1) Russia gets really freaked out about it, and 2) it’s (somewhat) in Western interests for Ukraine to not ‘win’. The longer this drags out, the more fucked Russia is. (Also Ukraine long term, but eggs need to be broken to make an omelette!). And from a western perspective, this is a remarkably cheap proxy war.

Your existence hinging on a dictators mood isn't nice, but what's worse is making it game theoretically necessary for them to glass you immediately. reply roywiggins 14 hours agorootparentprevProbably not, but just in case, Putin announced his nuclear torpedo: https://thebulletin.org/2023/06/one-nuclear-armed-poseidon-t... reply light_hue_1 15 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is that it's total nonsense.

The US has wasted over 350 billion dollars on this with nothing to show for it. And that's an attempt to stop one ICBM with one reentry vehicle. Russian missiles are far more sophisticated and their launchers are all over the place. You can't stop them on the ascent phase where this would be feasible. After that stopping a modern ICBM is impossible. A single missile contains up to a dozen warheads (MIRV) plus decoys all moving at several miles per second! There's no hope. No amount of wishful thinking is going to overcome basic physics. If we don't like the dictator we should depose them and support democracy everywhere.

It's the middle part that's scary (where we are now I guess) reply londons_explore 12 hours agorootparentIf camera based self driving doesn't happen at first, it never will later. That's because it would be a safety downgrade, and the public never accepts new technology which does the same as a previous one, yet drops a safety feature. For example, requiring a handbrake separate from the main brakes in cars. There hasn't been an engineering reason to keep these separate for 50 years, the main brakes already are doubly redundant. But people won't adjust laws to reduce safety, even if the safety reduction is so vanishingly small so as to not matter. reply orwin 12 hours agorootparentprevThe issue with vision only, especially without IR is that even if it becomes safer than a human, it won't ever have the awareness of vision+IR/Lidar, thus be less safe. reply Vortigaunt 16 hours agoprevBut elon told me FSD would come out next year![1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] [1]https://fortune.com/2015/12/21/elon-musk-interview/ [2]https://x.com/elonmusk/status/686279251293777920 [3]https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/02/self-driv...

    "originLink": "https://xeiaso.net/blog/2024/k8s-irc-client/",
    "originBody": "My IRC client runs on Kubernetes Published on 08/23/2024, 1098 words, 4 minutes to read Trust me, there's a reason for this A light-blue haired anime woman with a pixie cut in a white hoodie and short skirt drinking coffee in Seattle, space needle, smartphone, chat bubbles, blue halo - Black Forest Flux.1 [dev] IRC has historically been one of the most important chat programs in my life. It's how I met my husband, how I found jobs in the early stages of my career, how I get help with weird Linux arcana that nobody else can really fix, and it's where I socialize with the Internet Illuminati. I use it every day and main reason I use tmux is to attach to that one session with my IRC client in it. However, there's a problem with this setup: it's tied to one physical computer. If that physical computer dies, I lose easy access to all my IRC logs. My IRC logs folder is ridiculously large: $ du -hs .weechat/logs 5.0G .weechat/logs This is five gigabytes of text. This represents a huge fraction of my digital life and is some of the most important data to me. Not to mention my 188 kilobytes of configuration that I've built up over the years. Point is, there's a lot of data here and I want to make sure that it's easy to access via a shell like I'm used to. I also want it to be a bit more redundant so that if one physical computer dies then it'll just be rescheduled to another machine and I'll be back up and chatting within minutes without human intervention. Seeing as there's realistically not many other options for this (and I already have a Kubernetes cluster), I decided to move my IRC client into a VM on top of Kubernetes. What? Why? After reading that last bit, I'm sure that some of you have questions like this:You're using a container orchestrator for virtual machines? That seems a bit...unorthodox. Why not just put it into a container? What's wrong with that? There's a couple properties of Kubernetes that I'm going to be taking advantage of here: Kubernetes detects node failure and reschedules jobs to other machines as it happens. I already have Kubernetes set up (the best orchestrator is the one you already have). If I'm going to have a SSH daemon and tmux running in a container, I might as well just run a whole normal Linux distro so that I can use systemd for this instead of having to reinvent my own service management layer. The big thing that makes all this work is my combination of Kubevirt and Longhorn. Kubevirt lets you schedule virtual machines onto Kubernetes and import cloud-friendly images into your cluster. Longhorn is what I use for replicated block/file storage in my Kubernetes cluster, which makes everything have at least three copies in my homelab. This combination allows me to have a virtual machine that automagically gets run somewhere in the homelab. I don't have to think about it. I don't have to care. It just works. It also backs up all of the data to Tigris, which makes me feel better about the data being intact if my house were to catch on fire.This is what I wanted to implement with waifud, but now I don't need to use that project at all. It even imports cloud-config metadata for me! It's glorious. The big moveFor your convenience when reading, Kubernetes and Kubevirt terms are written in JavaClassNameCase. To be extra unambiguous the first time a term is used, the \"owner\" of the term will be written next to it, such as a \"Kubevirt VirtualMachine\" or a \"Kubernetes Service\". To move my IRC client over to Kubernetes, I needed three objects: A Kubevirt DataVolume, which is a Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim that gets pre-seeded with the contents of a Linux distribution. A Kubevirt VirtualMachine, which is like a Kubernetes Deployment, but it uses a template that has a virtual machine hypervisor enabled. A Kubernetes Service to expose ports on that VirtualMachine with a stable IP address and DNS name so that I can SSH into it and another one of my bots can use my IRC client as a bouncer. Each of those objects are defined in Xe/x/kube/alrest/vms/arona/arona.yaml. The most exciting one I want to highlight here is the Kubevirt DataVolume: apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1beta1 kind: DataVolume metadata: name: \"arona\" namespace: waifud spec: storage: storageClassName: longhorn volumeMode: Block # or filesystem accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce # Necessary as it's no longer has a default resources: requests: storage: 64Gi source: http: url: \"https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/daily/server/noble/current/noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img\" This is kinda exciting to me because I implemented this in waifud with the most fucked Rust code ever. My implementation also assumed that the contents of cloud image URLs didn't change (spoiler alert: they do, all the time), and overall I wasn't really happy with how it worked in practice. Kubevirt DataVolumes make this irrelevant and I am so happy that I can grab something off the shelf for this. It's worth having to use Kubernetes for this. From there all I needed was a hostname for the machine, to write some stuff in a shell script, copy a systemd unit out of the Arch wiki, and then to copy over my giant .weechat folder.I chose the hostname arona by opening a four-split of gacha game fandom wikis and clicking the \"random page\" button on each of them, then picked the one that sounded nicest. The other options were yanfei, hanabi, and changli, but arona just sounded better. The results A screenshot of my VM arona running neowofetch, showing off the fact that it has 4 hours of uptime, is using about a gigabyte of ram, and is running Ubuntu 24.04. I'm pretty happy with this so far! The VM automatically gets backed up every night, it's replicated between my machines, and to get into it, I just run ssh xe@arona.waifud.svc.alrest.xeserv.us and then get into weechat with the command chats.

The bit I find most provoking is the \"if you already have Kubernetes...\" premise. I find myself having a hard time not wanting to shove everything into the Kubernetes framework simply to avoid having to document what solutions I've chosen. `kubectl get all` gives me an overview of a project in a way that is impossible if every single project uses a different or bespoke management system. \"simple/complex\" is not the right paradigm. The real SRE controversy is \"unique/standard\". Yes, the standard approach is more complex. But it is better _in practice_ to have a single approach, rather than many individually-simpler, but in-aggregate-more-complex approaches. Kubernetes is never the perfect solution to an engineering problem, but it is almost always the most pragmatic solution to a business problem for a business with many such problems. reply akdor1154 20 hours agoparentYeah k8s is great. It gives you an infinite rope generator to let you hang yourself with ever increasing complexity, but with a bit of restraint you can orchestrate pretty much anything in a simple or at least standard way. I'd take a stack of yaml over a stack of bespoke aws managed service scripts any day. reply ownagefool 9 hours agorootparentThis is a great response and pretty much sums it up. With k8s you can easily install a bunch of helm charts and get a bespoke platform that becomes a full time role for multiple people.

But it is better _in practice_ to have a single approach, rather than many individually-simpler, but in-aggregate-more-complex approaches. There still remains such a strong reflexive \"you don't need Kubernetes for that\" response that shows up. But we really are seeing a lot more people who get the value of there being a standard way of doing things, of having common platform & expectations underneath. The cost of starting up may be significant, but it results in a more legible understandable result, and we can keep reusing that base of capabilities again and again and again. Its such an exciting change. Open source has been around for a long time, but running software has been the wild West, until very very recently. We now have this awesome, scalable, extensible way to manage containers, volumes, load balancers, databases, and whatever else have we. Love to see it. Folks aren't wrong about it having complexity, but so much of the complexity already existed, was just not clearly visible or well harnesses (different example is like how systemd makes it so easy to restrict services, give them temporary/unprivileged users). We are closer to a real shared understanding, to having so many particular decisions offloaded & so much more we can work together atop. Love it so much. reply skydhash 12 hours agorootparentComplex solutions exists for complex needs. If you just need to crop an image, you don’t install Photoshop to do so. If you only have a simple web app for a few thousands users, you don’t go and setup k8s. Yes, having photoshop means you may do what all the cool kids are doing, but if you’re only cropping image, Preview.app is good enough. Eschewing simpler solutions because “standard” is how you start to see everything as a nail for your hammer. There’s another thing that no one who advocates for these systems wants to mention: The cost of maintenance. I’m ok with systemd as 98% is outsourced to the maintainers. But I’d be more comfortable if k8s was a more monolithic system a la BSD. At least linux have distros. reply fesc 27 minutes agorootparent> for a few thousands users It makes absolutely no sense to base this decision on the number of users. We have some applications that don't even have 10 users but still use k8s. Try to understand the point that was made in the original comment: Kubernetes is a way to actually make infrastructure simpler to understand for a team which maintains lots of different applications, as it can scale from a deployment with just one pod to hundreds of nodes and a silly microservices architecture. The point is not that every application might need this scalability, no the point is that for a team needing to maintain lots of different applications, some internal, some for customers, some in private datacenters, some in the cloud, Kubernetes can be the single common denominator. Hell, I'm a hardcode NixOS fan but for most services, I still prefer to run them in k8s just as it is more portable. Today I might be okay having some service sitting on some box, running via systemd. But tomorrow I might want to run this service highly available on some cluster. Using k8s that is simple, so why not do it from the start by just treating k8s as a slighly more powerful docker-compose. reply Yasuraka 11 hours agorootparentprevK8s has distros, most of them certified to be compatible, and some of them are monolithic(-ish (single binary)), such as k3s/rke2. reply quectophoton 15 hours agorootparentprev> There still remains such a strong reflexive \"you don't need Kubernetes for that\" response that shows up. If you're already using docker-compose, the jump from there to Docker Swarm is arguably tiny in comparison to the jump from there to Kubernetes, while still bringing most of its value. So yes, I will keep evaluating the tradeoffs every time and choose accordingly. reply politelemon 11 hours agoparentprev> But it is better _in practice_ to have a single approach, rather than many individually-simpler, but in-aggregate-more-complex approaches. Very much depends on the point of view. It's great from an SRE point of view but not necessarily application/developers, who are being constrained to a platform's idiosyncracies and expressions of platform egos. The individually simpler solutions are only complex from a high level, ivory tower, or middle management perspective, not from the perspective of people who have to use and manage the application itself. reply ownagefool 10 hours agorootparentI think just running a process and exposing a port is fine, but the second you get into running a bunch of services together, or caring about environments, the k8s abstraction is simpler. In the last 6 months my job has been to get production ready vault instances on azure. There's a bunch of complex, unreliable and not very fun APIs here. Much like AWS, there isn't really a StatefulSet ( PetSet ) abstraction. To you need to write a bunch of bespoke logic where you figure which IP addresses, names, IDs, and Disks you need to attach to a new VM. Whilst iterating, the azure APIs are eventually consistent that cause all sort of niggly problems. Resources that are created don't get added to TF when there's a failure. I create a new vault on a PR and it takes 20 minutes to deploy. The problem took a couple of months and I created a bunch of code. On k8s I can just deploy the helm chart in 2 minutes. The abstractions are cleaner, it's more reliable, and way more fun. At the end of the azure project, the team agreed to do a AKS poc, where we gave the task to the junior of the team, and the entire thing was done in a week. If you're not doing this type of work, maybe you don't need k8s. But if you're not doing ephemeral test environments, do you actually not see them as a positive, or is it an effort thing? Because it takes me no real effort. reply thesnide 11 hours agoparentprevIf you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Then, it mostly works, so management makes \"economy of scales\" and removes all screw drivers, since they need more skills anyway. Now, you are only using nails. Until someone else rediscovers screws and starts another hype cycle. reply TeMPOraL 8 hours agorootparentExcept in manufacturing, this actually works. Economies of scale are real and trump pretty much every other consideration, and they're what enable pretty much everything we have around us that isn't biological. reply Spivak 21 hours agoparentprevIs the mountain of k8s code on top of your cloud of choice not strictly more complex than the cloud services it's orchestrating? Like I think k8s is good software but to hear that you're not choosing it because it's good engineering is surprising. To me that's the only reason you choose it, because you want or need the control-loop based infrastructure management that you can't get on say AWS alone. reply zipmapfoldright 20 hours agorootparentThat's the same with.. the Linux kernel? I'd wager that most services people write have less complexity than the the kernel it runs on. We choose to do that not because we need its full feature set, but because it gives us useful abstractions. reply cjk 19 hours agorootparentI don’t know that that’s the right analogy. End users don’t have to write a mountain of configuration in order to effectively use the Linux kernel. If k8s were as complex as it was, but didn’t force that complexity onto the user, I’d agree. reply Yasuraka 11 hours agorootparentAnd similarly, you don't need any configuration at all to just run k8s itself, you do need to configure your application and pay attention when exposing things, but the same holds true for an OS on a single machine. I believe the OS comparison is the most apt, both in the sense of the layer it represents, i.e. abstracting away physical machines and managing resources for applications, but also from what it means: one used to have to rewrite a program for each new computer as they were all unique (incl. CPU), just like each corp had its own way of managing infrastructure, clusters of nodes and automation. Any new application needed to be integrated from the ground up, which might be simpler in that you only touch what you actually need, but you also have to do it every single time, and it's different for each project/corp - with the vast majority missing out on the more complex bits that don't fit into an nginx config and some shell scripts. reply cortesoft 17 hours agorootparentprevYou can deploy quite a bit to k8s with just a few lines of helm installs, and it will work with very little configuration. reply Spivak 13 hours agorootparentprevExactly, I think I could have stated it better. Using k8s is strictly more complex from the perspective of the operator, and the mountain I'm referring to isn't actually from k8s itself but from all the 3rd party stuff you have to layer on to actually make it useful-- things like cluster-autoscaler, vpa, kube-prometheus, aws-load-balancer-controller, misc. operators, that fall on my side of the wall when it comes to fixing it when it's broken. I can understand that it doesn't come off that way but I actually like k8s and the surrounding ecosystem. But deploying k8s makes your infrastructure as complicated as k8s itself, which can be a massive win because it works in both directions. reply freeone3000 7 hours agorootparentI’m running Talos locally and run into basically none of these issues — use one of the provided storage providers, dump a container into it, bing bang boom you’re done. reply skydhash 12 hours agorootparentprevIf it can’t be monolithic like *BSD, at least offer distributions like the Linux Sphere.

Look at the linux kernel, or LLVM, or pretty much any other (successful) project that provides abstractions to many different backends. reply Spivak 21 hours agorootparentprevYes but that code isn't typically running in production the way k8s is. Having a lot of terraform is just a fancy method of statically provisioning infrastructure. The code is gone once it applies. Bringing k8s into the mix is a whole other application layer that's providing services to your code. Things like sgs for pods, cni plugins, coredns, is code that wouldn't be there in a non k8s world. Your problems now include k8s networking as well as VPC networking. reply marcinzm 17 hours agorootparent> The code is gone once it applies Until you need to update a change or upgrade something or patch a security issue.

Things like sgs for pods, cni plugins, coredns, is code that wouldn't be there in a non k8s world. The same applies to everything running around your tech stack that you didn't write. That includes the language runtime, the compiler, the operating system, all OS libraries you use, and the libraries your app imports. The ship has sailed and K8S isn't much of an addition. I haven't hit a CNI bug in probably 5 years and that was only on Amazon's horrible CNI code. I've hit a ton of bugs in my software stack. And the libraries I depend on. And my deployment stack.

Instead of weechat, I went with a nice web based irc client (the lounge) to replace my irccloud subscription. kubesearch makes it easy to find other people's configs to learn from (https://kubesearch.dev/hr/ghcr.io-bjw-s-helm-app-template-th...). reply gclawes 15 hours agoparentI really wish The Lounge supported something like a PostgreSQL/MySQL backend.

Especially if the \"servlets\" that those stateful connections are connected to require some heavy-ish work on startup, so you're vulnerable to the \"thundering herd\" scenario. But the author only uses it to keep alive a couple of IRC connections (which don't send you history or anything on re-connects) and to automatically backup their \"huge\" chat logs (seriously, 5 GiB is not huge, and if it's text then it can be compressed down to about 2 GiB — unless it's already compressed?). reply johntash 12 hours agoparentprevIt's only a problem if your nodes go up/down often, or you have other things causing pods to be pre-empted/etc. If you have a static number of nodes and don't have to worry too much about things autoscaling, I don't see why it couldn't be really stable? reply dijit 12 hours agorootparentYou don’t? Check out how services, load balancers and the majority of CNI actually work then. Kubernetes was designed for stateless connections and it shows in many places. If you want it to do stateful connections you could use something like Agones which intentionally bypasses a huge amount of kubernetes to use it only as a scheduler essentially. reply p_l 8 hours agorootparentA lot of the CNI/load balancer stuff was added as band aid for applications that don't cooperate nicely with k8s. Applications that act \"native\" and don't need a lot of the extras... Well, they arguably mostly use just the scheduler then :D reply dijit 8 hours agorootparentWait? you can run kubernetes with no CNI? My clusters have never even been able to register nodes as healthy without one. Maybe I’m doing it wrong? reply p_l 8 hours agorootparentTL;DR - today the CNI itself is interface to network implementation, so you'd need a minimal one. But you do not need a \"complex\" CNI. Originally k8s pretty much worked with assumption you can route few subnets in good old static way to the cluster and that's it, and it works with that kind of approach still - each node gets a /24, there's a separate shared /24 (or more) for services, etc. The complexities came from the fact that a lot of places that wanted to deploy kubernetes couldn't provide such a simple network infrastructure to hosts, then later what was a workaround got equipped with various extra bells&whistles reply AdamJacobMuller 22 hours agoprevKubevirt is great, but, I'm not sure why you wouldn't just run weechat inside a container.

Running tmux/screen inside a container is definitely cursed, but, it works surprisingly well. reply xena 22 hours agoparentAuthor of the article here. One of the main reasons is that I want to update weechat without rebuilding the container, taking advantage of weechat's soft upgrade method: https://weechat.org/files/doc/weechat/stable/weechat_user.en... And at that point, it may as well just be a normal Ubuntu server. reply AdamJacobMuller 22 hours agorootparentAh I didn't know wechat could do that, but, I remember that from my irssi days. I would personally consider that a bit of an anti-pattern (I would always want to have software upgrades tied to the container) but that makes sense! reply xena 22 hours agorootparentAs a long-time Docker-slonker I agree, however then that requires me to remember to upgrade the container images which means that it's harder to ensure that it's up to date. If you set up a cronjob to update the VMs packages and then a script that runs `/upgrade` on the weechat server every time the weechat package version changes, then you don't need to think. reply AdamJacobMuller 16 hours agorootparentI have this very easily setup to a set of simple commands which I can run to deploy new versions of packages. Basically 3 paths for: - things with well-maintained upstream helm charts (checks the latest version of the helm chart and updates helmfile) - things where I wrote a helm chart (checks for the latest container image and updates the values.yaml) - things where there is no (reasonable) public docker image, or my own software, where I have full CI/CD to build and deploy a new container image.

This way makes it somewhat standard with the rest of my setup. In SRE things the real enemy is when parts are unique in ways that conflict with the normal way of doing things. Look up at the \"unique/standard\" comment above and then take a moment to think about it.

I back up my homedir and etc and some other important data, and if I had to rebuild my OS I’m sure I’d do it far cleaner this time and wouldn’t want to fully do things the way I had them anyway.

Not having to manage systems anymore, and fully relying on kubernetes to configure and manage everything is great, especially leveraging the redundancy and reliability of it. reply Alupis 21 hours agorootparentPeople so very often are quick to look down upon anything using k8s these days, often citing complexity and some hand-wavy statement about \"you're not web scale\" or similar. These statements are usually accompanied by complex suggestions as \"more simple\" alternatives. On one hand you can manually provision a VM, configure the VM's firewall, update the OS, install several packages, write a bash script which can be used with cron, configure cron, setup backups, and more, followed by routine maintenance that is required to keep this system running and secure. This dance has to be done every time you deploy the app... oh, and don't forget that hack you did one late night to get your failing app back online but forgot to document! Or, on the other hand, you can write 1-3 relatively simple yaml files, just once, that explicitly describe what your app should look like within the cluster, and then it just does it's thing forever. k8s is very flexible and very useful, even for simple things. Why would you not use it, should be the default question. reply drdaeman 21 hours agorootparentSetting up and maintaining along the happy path is not an issue, it’s well-documented and has existing automations if desirable so you can set up a cluster in just a few minutes (if you have the experience already). And YAML files are nearly trivial in most cases. Boilerplate is not pretty but it’s easy. The only Problem (with a capital P) with K8s is when it suddenly and unexpectedly breaks down - something fails and you need to figure out what is going on. That’s where its complexity bites you, hard - because it’s a whole new OS on top of another OS - so, a whole new giant behemoth to learn and debug. If you’re lucky it’s already documented by someone so you can just follow the recipe, but if luck runs out (it always eventually does) it’s not a common case you’re going to have some very unpleasant time. I’m a lazy ass, I hate having to debug extremely complex systems when I don’t really need to. All those DIY alternatives are there not because people are struggling with NIH syndrome but because it is orders of magnitude simpler. YMMV. Or if you want to make K8s do something it isn’t designed or not presently capable of, so you need to hack on it. Grokking that codebase requires a lot of brainpower and time (I tried and I gave up, deciding I don’t want to, until the day finally comes and I must.) reply Alupis 21 hours agorootparentThis is the other common pushback on using k8s, and it's usually unfounded. Very rarely will you ever need to troubleshoot k8s itself, if ever. I highly doubt most situations, especially ones like this article, will ever encounter an actual k8s issue, let alone discover a problem that requires digging into the k8s codebase. If you are doing complex stuff, then ya, it will be complex. If you are not doing complex stuff and find yourself thinking you need to troubleshoot k8s and/or dig into the codebase - then you are very clearly doing something wrong. A homebrewed alternative will also be complex in those cases, and most likely more complex than k8s because of all the non-standard duct tape you need apply. reply cjk 19 hours agorootparentEven using managed k8s such as GKE, at $DAYJOB, we have run into issues where the default DNS configuration with kube-dns just falls over, and DNS resolution within workloads starts hanging/timing out. We were doing absolutely nothing special. Debugging it was challenging, and GCP support was not helpful. reply drdaeman 20 hours agorootparentprevHah. Okay, here's an anecdote. First time I had to look under the hood (and discover it's not exactly easy to get through the wiring) is when I set up my first homelab cluster. I wanted to run it over an IPv6-only network I had, and it while the control plane worked data plane did not - turned out that some places were AF_INET only. That was quite a while ago, and it's all totally okay. But it was documented exactly nowhere except for some issue tracker, and it wasn't easy to get through CNI codebase to find enough information to find that issue. So, it wasn't doing something wrong, but I had to look into it. So I ran that cluster over IPv4. But it was a homelab, not some production-grade environment - so, commodity hardware, flaky networks and chaos monkeys. And I had it failing in various ways quite frequently. Problems of all kind, mostly network-related - some easy and well-documented like nf_conntrack capacity issues, some were just weird (spontaneous intermittent unidirectional connectivity losses that puzzled me, and the underlying network was totally okay, it was something in the CNI - I had to migrate off Weave to, IIRC, Calico, as Weave was nicer to configure but too buggy and harder to debug). I also ran a production GKE cluster, and - indeed - it failed much less often, but I still had to scrape and rebuild it once, because something had happened to it, and by then I knew that I'm simply not in capacity of proper diagnostics (but creating new nodes and discarding old ones, so all failing payloads migrate is easy - except, of course, that it solves nothing in the long term). In the end, for the homelab, I realized I don't need the flexibility of K8s. I briefly experimented with Nomad, and realized I don't even need Nomad for what I'm running. All I essentially wanted was failover, some replicated storage, and a private network underneath. And there are plenty of already robust age-proved tools for doing all of those. E.g. I needed a load balancer, but not specifically K8s load balancer. I know nginx and traefik a little bit, including some knowledge of of their codebase (I debugged both, successfully) so I just picked one. Same for the networking and storage, I just built what I needed from the well-known pieces with a bit of Nix glue, much more simpler and direct/hardcoded rather than managed by CNI stack. Most importantly, I didn't need fancy dynamic scaling capacities at all, as all my loads were and still are fairly static. As for that GKE cluster - it worked, until the company failed (for entirely non-technical reasons with upper management). If you know what I did wrong, in general - please tell. I'm not entirely dismissing K8s (it's nice to have its capabilities), but currently have a strong opinion that it's way too complex to be used when you don't have a team or person who can actually understand it. Just like you wouldn't run GNU/Linux or FreeBSD on server back in '00s without having an on-call sysadmin who knows how to deal with it (I was one, freezing my ass in the server room, debugging NIC driver crashing kernel at 2am - fun times (not really)!, and maybe I grew dumber but a lot of Linux source code is somewhat comprehensible to me, while K8s is much harder to get through.) This is all just my personal experience and my personal attitude to how I do things (I just hate not knowing how things in my care/responsibility work, because I feel helpless). As always, YMMV. reply Alupis 19 hours agorootparent1) If you're dipping into Calico and friends then I'd argue your setup is not simple, so it is not surprising your config/experience were also not simple. Configuring a VPC and setting up routes etc for any cloud provider by hand will also be quite complicated. In my opinion, this is not a k8s issue, but rather just a complexity issue with your setup. Sometimes complexity is necessary... 2) IPv6 is an issue even today with many systems. There's also not a large need to run IPv6 inside your cluster, but I have not actually tried and cannot comment on how well it works. It's possible it was a \"round hole, square peg\" issue at the time. 3) Regarding your GKE Cluster, I find it improbable that k8s itself was borked, especially so if it was \"managed\" k8s from the cloud provider (meaning they provide the control plane, etc). It seems to me it's much more likely something inside the cluster broke (ie. one of your apps/services) and in the heat of the moment it was easier to just throw everything out. Cycling nodes has the effect of redeploying your apps/service (they are not migrated the way something like xen or vmware does), which probably indicates they were the issue if you did not also modify the manifests at the same time. Were your services configured with the relevant health endpoints k8s uses to determine if your app is still alive & ready to receive requests? Without it, a failing app will stay failed, and k8s won't necessarily know to cycle it. reply drdaeman 18 hours agorootparent> If you're dipping into Calico and friends That was my homelab (all bare metal, except for one node that was an VPS), so full DIY setup without any clouds, meant to try things out and learn how they work. I tried a bunch of CNI options, I remember at least Weave, Calico and Flannel. I just opened K8s page about networking and looked at the presented options, trying them out. The idea was to learn stuff. I’ve yet to see a complex system that never fails, so I wanted to see how it works (and what are the limitations, thus the v6 experiment, heterogeneous node architecture with one aarch64 node, etc.), how it can fail (accelerated through less homogeneous and less reliable conditions) and what does it take to debug and fix it. On my terms, when I can tolerate downtime and have time to research, not when a real production system decides it wants to satisfy Murphy laws at the worst possible moment. And - no surprise - it had its failures, and I learned that debugging those aren’t easy at all. Was nice when it worked, of course (or I wouldn’t have bothered at all). > Regarding your GKE Cluster, I find it improbable that k8s itself was borked Well, what can I say? It did, and it certainly wasn’t an application-level error. Actually, now I remember (it was five years ago or about so - quite a while so my memory is blurry) it did that not once but twice. One time I diagnosed the issue - it was a simple conntrack table overflow, so I had to bump it up. Another time, I have no idea what was wrong - I just lost database connectivity, but I’m certain it wasn’t the application or the database but something in the infra. reply cjk 15 hours agorootparentI have had similar experiences on GKE.

    "originLink": "https://kevinboone.me/tpwin.html",
    "originBody": "Kevin Boone Home Contact CV Software Articles 🔍 They don’t make ’em like that any more: Borland Turbo Pascal 7 Borland’s Turbo Pascal was one of the most successful programming tools of all time. It introduced development techniques, such as integrated source-level debugging, that we take for granted today; but which were radical at the time. TP 7, also known as Turbo Pascal for Windows 1.5, was the pinnacle of the Turbo Pascal line, and its end. The name ‘Turbo’ was associated with what were regarded as hobbyist products – ‘Borland Pascal’ was a different, much more expensive, product. But Turbo Pascal was enough for some quite substantial applications, and was very affordable. It was also ‘book licensed’, which I think was a new thing in the software industry. You could buy one copy of TP, and any number of people could use it – but only one at a time. Even when it was distributed on floppy disks, there was no copy protection. (Turbo) Pascal eventually gave way to Delphi which, despite its technical merits, never had the same impact. I used TP 7 to write medical imaging software back in the 90s, to run under Windows 3.1 – which was a great operating system in its day. Like previous releases, Windows 3.1 was still, essentially, an extension to MSDOS, but with clever tricks to allow it to multitask (after a fashion) and address more memory. It had a simple, consistent user interface model – both for the user and the programmer. It had, at that time, none of the wasteful and irritating anti-features that have come to make modern Windows so depressing to use. So Windows 3.1 was a platform we all wanted our applications to support – not that there were many alternatives at that time. Like many other programmers, I learned the Pascal programming language specifically to use TP 7 – I was essentially a C programmer in those days, but programming for Windows in C was a horrible job. Frankly, it’s scarcely better today. It was, and is, necessary to combine a whole stack of command-line tools that take incomprehensible text files as input. TP 7 automated and concealed all that nastiness. It wasn’t just the tools that were a problem: the user interface model was, essentially, object-oriented; but C did not make it easy to program in an object-oriented way. TP 5 had introduced basic object-oriented concepts to the Pascal language, and these were were to prove essential. The Windows-specific features were provided by something called Object Windows Library: a relatively thick, object-oriented wrapper around the basic Windows C API. My recollection is that Borland introduced an object-oriented programming library for Microsoft Windows before Microsoft did – and Borland’s was better. Turbo Pascal running in Windows 3.1 OWL made it easy to create nice-looking user interfaces, with a bit of eye candy. The familiar ‘green tick button’ was an OWL enhancement, which graced so many Windows applications that it eventually became an irritating cliche. All, in all, It was much easier to program for Windows using Turbo Pascal 7 than with anything else. Not only did it provide a programming model that matched the way the Windows user interface worked, the application itself had a Windows graphical interface – many Windows programming tools at that time actually ran under MSDOS, and were entirely text-based. TP 7 also had fully-graphical tools for designing the user interface elements, like menus and icons. Laying out a menu using a definition file with an obscure format, using Windows Notepad, was never an agreeable experience. Microsoft did produce graphical tools for this kind of operation, but Turbo Pascal combined them into a seamless IDE. All I had to do to build and run my programs was to hit the F7 key. I could even set breakpoints for the debugger, just by clicking a line of code. As I said, common enough today, but revolutionary for early Windows programming. But what really made TP 7 special was its CP/M heritage. Turbo Pascal came to Windows by way of CP/M and MSDOS, which meant it had a compiler core that was designed to run with tight memory and a comparatively slow CPU. In the days when most compilers had to write a stack of intermediate files on disk, TP just constructed everything in memory. It did this using highly-optimized code, written in assembly language, by very skilled people. It doesn’t matter much today if your compiler spits out a heap of temporary files, because disk storage is fast and cheap. But in the days of the floppy disk, you had to minimize disk access. Unfortunately, you also had to minimize memory use, because there wasn’t much of that, either. Programming for CP/M took real skill and dedication. So when TP came to Windows machines, with their 16-bit CPUs and megabytes of RAM, it was like an early Christmas for developers. A compiler designed to be adequate with 32kB of RAM and a single floppy drive will positively fly when given megabytes and a hard disk. All this meant that TP 7 was a joy to use. It was like a modern IDE, but without any of the bloat. Developers who would never have tackled Windows programming with Microsoft tools were able to move from MSDOS to Windows without too much difficulty – even if they first had to learn Pascal, as I did. The compiled code was pretty speedy but, if it wasn’t brisk enough, you could write assembly language directly in the Pascal source files. I don’t think it’s too much of an exaggeration to claim that Turbo Pascal contributed to the widespread uptake, and eventual domination, of Microsoft Windows on desktop PCs. If there had been a ‘Turbo Pascal for Linux’ in the early 90s, then we might all be running Linux on our desktops today. So what happened to Turbo Pascal? Three things, at least, contributed to its eventual downfall. First, there was increasing competition from the C programming language. Borland did produce a Turbo C, and later a Turbo C++, but they weren’t as influential as Pascal. It’s easy to forget that PCs weren’t the first general-purpose computing devices. Most scientific and educational establishments, and many businesses, used graphical workstations and a central minicomputer. C was already well-established in these environments before desktop computers started to become prominent. And before that we had mainframes and terminals – but that was a different world, where Fortran and COBOL ruled. Most ‘serious’ PC applications were written in assembly language in the early days, as they had been for CP/M – the low resources almost necessitated this. Minicomputers were not so limited, so compilers were more practicable, even in the 1980s. So when compilers started to become of interest to microcomputer developers, there was almost no reason to favour one programming language over another. Pascal could have become the standard programming language for the PC. That it did not, I think, reflects the fact that many software companies that had been active in industrial and scientific computing saw an opportunity in PCs, and tried to move into that market. These companies already had substantial experience with C, and they brought their preferences with them. So while I was happy to learn a new programming language to develop for Windows, a software business with a thousand staff might not have wanted to take that step. The second factor, I think, was the increasing palatability of Microsoft’s C tools. Microsoft did eventually produce an IDE of its own and, of course, Microsoft controlled the Windows platform. I don’t think Microsoft’s C IDEs ever became as easy to use as Borland’s, but they probably didn’t have to, given Microsoft’s position. Third, Microsoft’s Visual BASIC started to attact small-scale and bespoke developers. BASIC was already a staple of the microcomputing world, because it was easy to learn, and did not require a separate compilation step. Attaching bits of BASIC code to Windows user interface elements was an efficient way to produce relatively simple, small-volume applications. I loathed Visual BASIC in the 90s, and I loathed it until the day VB6 drew its last laboured, wheezing breath in 2005. Still, I can’t deny its popularity, and I’m sure that many of the same people who were drawn to Turbo Pascal were later drawn to Visual BASIC, for much the same reasons. VB lowered the barriers to entry into Windows programming in the same way that TP had previously done. Arguably it lowered them too much, but let’s not go there today. Early versions of Turbo Pascal are now freely, and legally, available. Retrocomputing enthusiasts with an interest in early PCs and MSDOS are well catered for. So far as I know, however, TP 7 remains somebody’s intellectual property, although it isn’t entirely clear whose. It probably comes into the category of ‘abandonware’ but, to be frank, it’s not all that important: it can’t produce code that runs on modern Windows systems, and few people have much interest in early Windows – it’s just not retro enough. So that’s Turbo Pascal: a colossus of the microcomputing world, which faded and died largely unlamented. It always was a creature of its time – it prospered for the brief period when microcomputers were limited enough to reward skilled development, but widespread enough to create a substantial market for programmers. By the time it started to become difficult to find enough highly-skilled programmers to satisfy the market needs, it didn’t matter: computers were getting powerful enough to make good our limitations as programmers. That almost nobody has the skills these days to implement something like TP is something we could eventually come to regret – or, rather, our grandchildren could. Software development is becoming a semi-skilled industry, and I doubt that the rise of AI will entirely compensate for this. But who needs a Turbo Pascal, when you have 128Gb of RAM attached to an 5GHz CPU, for a hastily-written, bloated Java program to burn? Categories: TDMTLTAM, retrocomputing Last update Feb 13 2024",

If anything, the rise (read as: shoving-down-our-throats) of AI/machine learning will hurt the collective ability to code, rather than compensate for it in the least. So many modern developers take pride in using their CoPilots and related AI/machine-learning tools to assist in coding, all the while ignoring that such usage actively keeps them from improving their own coding skills, in the same way that copying a classmate's test answers might let the copier pass the test without actually teaching them anything. When that day comes that AI can pump out a complete, working, bug-free application based on natural-language descriptions, we will have lost the ability to code entirely, as any code such a thing generates will never be maintainable by a mere human being. _Sigh_.

TP v4, v5, v6... i'd graduated to C by the time 7 came out.\" Mee too, and it is painful to realize how much ahead of its time the IDE was. I am talking about the TUI version and yet: - It already supported a dual monitor setup - one monitor for the IDE, one for the app - live debugging was a charm. - The debugger had everything current debuggers have, but it was fully IDE integrated - no messin' with GDB or JDWP. - The context sensitive help was the best, I never encountered a better one. I think a large part of it was that it really was context sensitive and it tried to solve the problem at hand, regardless if it was caused by the IDE or the language. reply mikewarot 1 hour agoparentprev>i'd graduated to C by the time 7 came out. I've never seen C as an improvement. Macros encourage all too clever code that's impossible to parse at first glance. The string handling is horrible. The fact that there are multiple contradictory ways to express pointers. The only thing holding Free Pascal/Lazarus back is the documentation. There's no way to work on a small part of it, Wiki style, so it's always going to be an albatross. The auto-generated descriptions of variables used in library function calls just don't work as proper documentation. On the plus side, it's fast and has all of the linking built in.

A large part of the industry just _thinks_ these things aren't relevant to them and that's why we have such terrible software everywhere. reply epolanski 5 hours agorootparentI don't buy this, at all. In my industry experience software is slow because: - time to market is overwhelmingly more important than performance so the pressure is to have something that works, not something that works smoothly. You can fix performance or bugs later (Notion is an easy example of such evolution). - the industry keeps being largely understaffed so finding resources to allocate to performance is hard - most of the industry is managed by people that are neither good at product nor tech, but think they understand products and tech reply jebarker 5 hours agorootparentThe point is that if you understand how the high-level code you write gets translated to what runs on the actual CPU and memory then you write more performant high-level code by default the first time round. So you can get to market just as quickly.

An ERP package in 6 months (access). Code quality, which is difficult to objectively measure, was not really a problem.

I switched to C reluctantly in college because it was portable to the 32-bit Sun workstations we had, then I was a Linux Zealot for a decade or so so I never jumped in the Delphi (sequel to TP) train. In the early 1980s there was a push for “anything but BASIC” for teaching languages. Before TP, in my mind PASCAL had the stink of failure between the watching-protons-decay slowness of UCSD Pascal and the inadequacy of ISO Pascal to do anything but solve leetcode problems. C on the other hand accomplished what PL/I had set out to do in a “worse is better” way. TP added enough of what ISO Pascal was lacking to be fine for systems and applications work like C but it was saner, didn’t have the null terminated strings which made strcpy() + a later return Turing complete in C. TP felt just a little more disciplined than C, like a pop version of Ada. reply marcodiego 5 hours agoprevThe builtin help in Borland IDE's was supreme.

Unfortunately, you also had to minimize memory use, because there wasn’t much of that, either. Of course, the “heap of temporary files” is itself originally an adaptation for low main memory. The genius of Turbo Pascal is exactly that on those early PCs main memory was large enough / mass storage was small enough that for the program sizes in question the architecture of many passes communicating via disk files just wasn’t worth it. As far as I know, that was never true on minicomputers that our compiler tech was born on, and it’s very much not true on PCs now. (Consider: DOS machines had 100s of K to perhaps 4M of RAM and a couple megs to several dozen megs of floppy or disk, amounting to a proportion of perhaps 1:20. The laptop I’m typing this on has 4×10¹² bytes of mass storage and 64G bytes of RAM, a ratio of about 1:60, and I specifically made sure to get an abnormally large amount of RAM.) reply renewedrebecca 4 hours agoparentYou’ve got to wonder though: why in the world do we need that much memory? reply ASalazarMX 1 hour agorootparentJust like porn advanced web technologies, videogames advanced PC hardware. Don't believe anyone who tells you that porn and videogames are useless, they were the recreative equivalent of the Apollo Program. reply mananaysiempre 2 hours agorootparentprevI mean, I know why I got that much—I really value the ability to load up a ~20GB dataset into Pandas or pipe it through AWK for a one-off (or ten-off) task and just not worry about the particulars. Running `make -j16` and having the system stay usable while the compiler chews through the hundreds of KLOC of (admittedly very... vertical-looking) C and C++ is also appreciated. Also, memory modules are cheap and I feel stupid paying the markup for basically the same ICs soldered down, and once I had the slots available, well, as I said, memory modules are cheap. More generally, though, screens and syntax trees. First, a laptop screen that an 19th century book printer wouldn’t call an atrocity against the art (say 200ppi and above), at 32 bpp, takes ~16 MB for a single framebuffer. At 60 Hz, that means your display panel interface is already pushing 750 MB/s of useful data (and I’m ignoring all the legacy cruft like overscan and vblank). Unsurprisingly, the GPU that does all that, for multiple layers, in floating point (so 96 or 128 bpp), is heavily pipelined. Feeding that pipeline adequately and without heroics means at least a length-3 swapchain, so already you have 48 MB of screen buffers for any full-screen app that you don’t need to wait to redraw after you switch to it (remember when we needed to do that?). If said app is showing something large and scrollable, and you count on being able to see the thing you’re scrolling (remember when you couldn’t? thank touch input for killing that), that’s probably also, what, three, four screens’ worth of prerendered tiles? And now we’re already pushing a hundred megs—just for the pixels. How many browser tabs do you have open? (Personally, I get really irritated when my browser gets an attention deficit and doesn’t immediately show me the tab after I click on it.) Or thousand-page PDF specs? (I was recently installing an old version of Windows in QEMU, and the installer showed me the installation wizard’s window—with all the text and controls—first and then spent multiple seconds blitting a purely frivolous graphic of a computer with installation disks around it onto the left pane. I didn’t remember computers used to do that! At least until you got around to installing the graphics driver, anyway, I guess.) Second, I’ve been mulling over a Web browser’s job, and I can’t help but conclude that it’s really bloody awful. The existence of the mutable DOM means it has to maintain a full-fat syntax tree for all the HTML—a humongous soup of pointers in a 64-bit address space (so in modern browsers they are hand-rolled 32-bit not-really-pointers). On top of that it needs to have an acceleration structure for style recomputation accessed on the critical user interaction path (because :hover), as well as a layout tree with line boxes supporting dynamic Unicode- (even BiDi-) aware line breaking and perhaps even hyphenation on resize, and none of that should fall over if you load up War and Peace in the original Russian+French with the paragraph breaks deleted. It’s old compiler lore that no syntax tree will be as compact as the source code it was constructed from. Browsers sound like the bottommost circle of syntax tree hell even more than a general GUI has to be. The situation is probably salvageable with a flattened representation like the one Jetpack Compose uses and differential execution[1] used before it. But it’s definitely a lot of work, and to my admittedly cursory knowledge noöne’s really working on it. (This part inspired by the urge to clutch my pearls that I felt while watching Andreas Kling’s Ladybird videos—there’s a lot of very thicc pointer soup in there, and I don’t think it’s possible to morph it into something saner in a continuous fashion. But then I thought about the problem, and yeah, the problem sucks.) So all in all I think single-digit gigs sound about fair, I think, and that’s how much my system typically shows when I’m not deliberately running heavy stuff on it. (For what it’s worth, I once spent weeks cramming all data required for Unicode normalization into about 20K. It’s certainly possible, but as it turns out, three iterations of fetch-shift-popcount for every character is slow.

Fun fact: this lived on in Delphi, TP's successor. The TBitBtn component, a button with an image and one of the oldest Delphi components (probably from Delphi 1?), has a Kind property that auto-sets all sorts of glyphs; Kind := bkOk sets it to a green check. About a year ago the glyph was updated to look a little more modern :) But it lives on. I love occasionally seeing it on apps in the wild. reply anta40 6 hours agoprevI also started learning programming in high school days (2001 - 2004) using TP 7. Fast, affordable internet connection wasn't pretty common on those days, so have to rely on internet cafes and books/magazies. As the name implies, it's indeed TURBO. I mean, to achive similar snapiness when running Eclipse or VS, you'll need pretty powerful machine. The legacy is carried on by Free Pascal folks (there's the text based IDE). I only use this for fun/nostalgia purpose. For actual work, well there's Lazarus IDE. reply bbarn 6 hours agoprevWas TP for Windows considered TP7?

Percentage-wise, the number may have dropped, but there are many more programmers now than there were back then. I even am not convinced that percentage is lower today. There are plenty of people in the demo scene who, if incentivized, could write something like it. You also have to realize that TP 7 is relatively simple compared to today’s development environments. To mention a few items: - pascal is a lot easier for an IDE than C - no messing with character encodings - the editor may be fast, but does it stay fast when confronted with very large files? - TP need not be cross-platform reply ape4 5 hours agoprevIts so successful and nice that Microsoft poached the good employees.

I mean we are in 2024 and should be well past the Java joke. Not only is modern Java seriously fast and could be efficient as well as natively compiled with Graal. ( Where 20 years ago GCJ was experimental at best ). The modern equivalent should really be Electron. But back on the topic, I really miss Pascal and Delphi. reply Varriount 6 hours agoparentAt least with Java you can select a GC which is more aggressive in giving memory back to the system (Shenandoah and ZGC). With Electron/Node you don't even get that (not to mention the fact Electron apps always spawn multiple processes). reply anta40 6 hours agoparentprevThe \"Java resource hog\" is still a thing...in a few areas. As an Android dev, I still see complaints (most likely by beginners) saying how Android Studio consumes much RAM and asking if it's possible to replace it with.. VSCode. I still remember doing Android development using Eclipse on a 2 GB PC and it was reasonably okay-ish. Of course it's practically impossible to use Android Studio on such machine. 8 GB is bare minimum. :D reply eklavya 5 hours agorootparent\"resource hog\" is a thing. Eclipse is java as well. reply anta40 5 hours agorootparentWell fair point. During my university days, there were 2 prominent Java-based IDEs: Eclipse and Netbeans. Even after installing some plugins, Eclipse ran faster, and thus become my primary IDE. I kinda miss Eclipse. On the other side, seems like most Java dev nowadays already switch to IntelliJ. reply layer8 5 hours agoparentprevThere are still aspects where Java is lacking: JVM startup time and memory usage. While you can work around the former with Graal native images, this messes with dynamic loading of classes and with reflection, which means you can’t do it for any random Java application or library. reply underseacables 6 hours agoprevBorland C++ was the most desired software when I was a kid among my friends. We tried like hell to pirate it. This brings back memories. reply mark-r 4 hours agoparentIf you couldn't afford Borland products, you were poor indeed. reply greenthrow 6 hours agoprevI was around back then and there is a lot of nonsense in this article. The biggest one being overstating Turbo Pascal's role in Windows' adoption. Nobody cared what tools programmers used back then. MS-DOS dominated and Windows dominated because they were the OS that came on IBM compatible PCs. And that platform was by far the dominant hardware platform at the time. All the software users wanted was on MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 was backwards compatible with MS-DOS. Etc. Etc. (And while some of that software was written in Pascal, most of it was not.) Pascal at that time was like Ruby or something is today. Definitely widely used but a far distant to the incredibly dominant C. There's no way to explain to folks today how dominant C was back then. If you were a software engineer learning C was just a given. You may or may not have bothered with BASIC, you may or may not be comfortable getting down to Assembly, but if you were serious about coding, you knew C. reply barrkel 6 hours agoparentThe new hotness was C++. Object orientation was the AI of its day. TP jumped on it so fast with 5.5 it ended up throwing away that object model for Delphi a few years later. TP had little impact on Windows, I agree. TP was for a particular niche, small software shops targeting DOS. And it was a big success, it paid for a nice building in Scotts Valley, but it also fuelled the ambitions of a bunch of executives who got derailed, getting into databases, a multi-pronged bet (Paradox, dBASE, Interbase) that didn't really pay off. reply overanalytcl 6 hours agorootparentDon't forget about the time Borland really thought they could outsmart Microsoft on .NET and gave us the wonderfully horrible Delphi 8. To put it into a metaphor, Delphi 7 was like XP, Delphi 8 was like Vista. People still use D7 while Borland and Embarcadero wants to forget they ever tried D8 (and Delphi Prism which is just rebranded Oxygene). And at about the same time they also tried doing a native Delphi for Linux, which was so bad they pulled out after 3 versions and never tried Linux again until recently (and even then, you can only cross-compile, you can't run Delphi 12 on Linux or macOS). And they also tried getting into the VCS sphere with StarTeam (which somehow still received updates well into 2017... Despite it being made in 1995). I don't know why OpenText decided to buy it in 2023. Let's not forget about Turbo Prolog and the time they almost did a Turbo Modula-2, but it was actually published by TopSpeed and now lives in Clarion. Ugh. Borland... Err, Inprise... Err, Embarcadero... Or CodeGear? Or Idera? Who keeps count? Anyway, that switched so many hands it's sad to see. They were doing way too much. A lot of bad decisions made them less and less popular (not like their current greed is helping their case). Oh well. Long live Free Pascal. reply greenthrow 6 hours agorootparentprevOne place I worked in the 90s had a bunch of meetings/tutorials to try to sell all the C programmers on Object Oriented Programming in general and C++ in particular -- the software in question was super complicated and massive and IMHO could have benefitted from some judicious application of OOP concepts like separation of concerns -- but it got caught in a rut of just constantly trying to explain OOP to middle aged programmers who had only ever written and thought in imperitive code. reply snozolli 5 hours agoparentprevif you were serious about coding, you knew C. I think this is fundamentally the same toxic thinking that is still with us today. C offered no actual advantages over Turbo Pascal for DOS/Windows programming. I'm sure one can come up with platforms or releases that weren't supported by TP, since C was the defacto standard. Regardless, they're fundamentally equivalent. Meanwhile, Turbo Pascal was blazingly fast compared to C. The C linker in particular used to take forever. Turbo Pascal was seen as a toy language. My AP Computer Science exam results were disregarded by colleges because it was in Pascal. A few years later, I was a C++ snob and looked down on Visual Basic \"macro hackers\". Meanwhile, at least one true genius electrical engineer I worked with would rapidly prototype software in VB that would take me weeks to replicate in C++. There's a weird disdain in software development for approachable, efficient tools that create actual business value. reply mark-r 4 hours agorootparentPascal with its tight type safety made certain things extra hard, like working with images. C on the other hand let you walk all over it. Pascal was very much my preferred language until I learned C - then I never looked back. reply fortran77 5 hours agoprevThis was the first easy way to write Windows software.

Ok, the man with quadriplegia also uses a joystick. It amazes me how inaccessible better hardware is. The woman who is deaf blind uses a refreshable braille keyboard. I looked up the cost and it's ~$3000USD. Even if some nonprofit organization pays for this, you still need parents and caregivers that know to take advantage of this. I have no hardware experience, but I think I may take on the task of making life easier for some people with disabilities. Quick ideas that popped to mind while watching the user stories: 1. Using AI to transcribe videos for people to have a standalone captions source other than their video player. 2. Several of the users use the tab key to fill out forms. Hell, Google search is nigh-impossible to use as keyboard only; Good luck with smaller sites. Some sort of open source project for handling tabbing logically would be awesome. Maybe a chrome extension that lets devs interface with it a la sponsorblock. 3. I'm fascinated by refreshable braille now. It's expensive because the technology seems pretty niche. I'm very uneducated on this topic but it feels like a cruder technology would also work, at the cost of size or throughput. There also don't seem to be any phones/portables with this capability.
