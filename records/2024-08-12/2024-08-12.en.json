(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) Read More By FATIMA HUSSEIN Updated 9:00 AM UTC, August 12, 2024 Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print WASHINGTON (AP) — In the name of consumer protection, a slew of U.S. federal agencies are working to make it easier for Americans to click the unsubscribe button for unwanted memberships and recurring payment services. A broad new government initiative, dubbed “Time Is Money,” includes a rollout of new regulations and the promise of more for industries spanning from healthcare and fitness memberships to media subscriptions. “The administration is cracking down on all the ways that companies, through paperwork, hold times and general aggravation waste people’s money and waste people’s time and really hold onto their money,” Neera Tanden, White House domestic policy adviser, told reporters Friday in advance of the announcement. “Essentially in all of these practices, companies are delaying services to you or really trying to make it so difficult for you to cancel the service that they get to hold onto your money for longer and longer,” Tanden said. “These seemingly small inconveniences don’t happen by accident — they have huge financial consequences.” Efforts being rolled out Monday include a new Federal Communications Commission inquiry into whether to impose requirements on communications companies that would make it as easy to cancel a subscription or service as it was to sign up for one. The Federal Trade Commission in March 2023 initiated “click to cancel” rulemaking requiring companies to let customers end subscriptions as easily as they started them. Also Monday, the heads of the departments of Labor and of Health and Human Services are asking health insurance companies and group health plans to make improvements to customer interactions with their health coverage, and “in the coming months will identify additional opportunities to improve consumers’ interactions with the health care system,” according to a White House summary. The government already has launched several initiatives aimed at improving the consumer experience. In October, the FTC announced a proposed rule to ban hidden and bogus junk fees, which can mask the total cost of concert tickets, hotel rooms and utility bills. In April, the Transportation Department finalized rules that would require airlines to automatically issue cash refunds for things like delayed flights and to better disclose fees for baggage or reservation cancellations. The department also has taken actions against individual companies accused of misleading customers. In June, the Justice Department, referred by the FTC, filed a lawsuit against software maker Adobe and two of its executives, Maninder Sawhney and David Wadhwani, for allegedly pushing consumers toward the firm’s “annual paid monthly” subscription without properly disclosing that canceling the plan in the first year could cost hundreds of dollars. Dana Rao, Adobe’s general counsel, said in an emailed statement that Adobe disagrees with the lawsuit’s characterization of its business and “we will refute the FTC’s claims in court.” “The early termination fees equate to minimal impact to our revenue, accounting for less than half a percent of our total revenue globally, but is an important part of our ability to offer customers a choice in plans that balance cost and commitment,” Rao said. Some business advocates are not a fan of the government’s overall efforts to crack down on junk fees. Sean Heather, senior vice president of international regulatory affairs and antitrust at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the initiative is “nothing more than an attempt to micromanage businesses’ pricing structures, often undermining businesses’ ability to give consumers options at different price points.” FATIMA HUSSEIN Hussein reports on the U.S. Treasury Department for The Associated Press.

This was always my opinion on this. \"As easy to cancel as it is to sign up\". It's simple, and completely shuts down this malicious behaviour without making it harder to operate for the honest companies (or worse for customers in any way I can think of). Usually these policies have downsides but I can't really think of any. This kind of behaviour is common among banks as well, they use their dinosaur status when it comes to things that are bad for their business, but can be very progressive on the other end of things. For example, to move loans from one bank to another you need some documents (here in Sweden at least) to be handed to the other bank. I had to first wait in the support, then ask politely to get these documents. They told me that they would snail mail them to me immediately, but after two weeks I called them again, then they said sorry and sent me a PDF instead proving that they could have done this immediately... reply efitz 4 hours agoparentI have been trying to get my state legislators to implement such a consumer law for over a decade. The federal proposal will likely be ineffective unless it has an individual cause of action. What that means is that the only way (IMO) such a law works is not if the government enforces it, but rather if any consumer can sue the company in small claims court for a reasonable judgment (eg $1000 or something). Now the company has to fix their ways or feel death from a million cuts, and the cost to defend likely exceeds the cost to pay. The other things the law needs (it may have but the article wasn’t clear) are clarity and penalties for dark patterns. For example, “as simple as it was to subscribe” needs to be WAY more detailed, eg “takes no more time for a reasonable person to unsubscribe than it did to subscribe” and “the user must be able to use the same communication channel or mechanism (eg web, mobile app, etc) used to subscribe, in order to unsubscribe”, and “at the time of subscription, unsubscribe instructions must be provided to the user via a persistent medium such as email”, and “the unsubscribe interface must be prominently discoverable on the web site or mobile application”, etc. And any dark patterns or intentional violations need to make the recoverable amount subject to a multiplier. I am happy that the government is tackling this but doing it through regulatory action is not likely to help much IMO; especially in light is the recent Supreme Court decision regarding Chevron deference, it’s likely not to last through legal challenges. (IANAL) reply eckesicle 4 hours agoparentprevSwedish legislation has it right here. You can unsubscribe by any means you prefer. Mail, email, phone call, a notice in your local newspaper, carrier pigeon. The choice is completely with the party who wishes to terminate the agreement. It incentivises companies to make it as simple as possible, because if they don’t the cost of manually handling requests coming in through all kinds of different channels quickly becomes excessive. reply dataflow 4 hours agorootparent> Mail, email, phone call, a notice in your local newspaper, carrier pigeon. How would that even... work? Doesn't this obligate every company to read every local newspaper in every customer's area? And a customer who feels like a company a hard time could just put a notice in the paper and then collect money because the company obviously won't read every newspaper? Also, what about companies wanting to give customers a hard time by canceling their subscriptions - now customers have to read every newspaper too? I must be missing something... reply fsckboy 3 hours agorootparent\"legal notice in a newspaper\" is still very much a thing in common law jurisdictions, with a long history, see banns going way back https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/banns if you change your name you need to put it in the newspaper, and https://futureofnewspapers.net/how-to-place-a-legal-notice-i... There are many different types of legal ads, with different costs to advertise. The most common type of legal notice in New York is an LLC formation notice. The State of New York requires limited liability corporations to run an ad informing the public on the formation of the new corporation. There are also FCC, SLA liquor licenses, sidewalk cafe notices, name change notices, divorce notices (also known as dissolution of marriage notices), and probate notices. reply dataflow 3 hours agorootparentI am well aware of that, but there is a very huge and crucial difference between putting something in the newspaper for the sake of public dissemination vs. for the sake of making sure one specific known private entity gets the information. The only case I can recall off the top of my head for the latter is for things like service of judicial papers, and even then as a last resort, only when direct attempts to reach the party have failed. I am not aware of a single case where a party that is already reasonably reachable has to monitor public media for private communication. reply fsckboy 1 hour agorootparent>there is a very huge and crucial difference between putting something in the newspaper for the sake of public dissemination vs. for the sake of making sure one specific known private entity gets the information yes, and that huge and crucial difference in this case is that the entities in question have attorneys on staff, and those attorneys understand their responsibilities on behalf of the corporation reply usrbinnooo 2 hours agorootparentprevAnd yet, in the US, you can have process servers publish a notice in a very specific law newspaper that only lawyers ever read, then claim that you couldn't reach someone who would never in their life read such a newspaper for decades simply to see if they've been served. If this sounds ridiculous, it's because it is, and yet somehow, we still do it. What Sweden does sounds no different, except it's companies with millions of dollars who could actually afford to check these things. reply dataflow 2 hours agorootparentAs I mentioned, AFAIK that's only as a last resort once you've been unreachable via other means, which doesn't sound ridiculous at all. Is that not the case? reply JohnFen 2 hours agorootparentprev> Doesn't this obligate every company to read every local newspaper in every customer's area? In my US state, a lot of important legal notices get published in the newspaper, so companies should already be effectively doing this. What most do (and what I've always done) is to subscribe to a clipping service that will scan the classifieds, nationwide if you want, for you and forward to you the types of items you want to be made aware of. reply BartjeD 3 hours agorootparentprevJust what you receive, i'd assume. Where reception is a legal definition. Essentially when a reasonable third party can be said to have received. In English legal systems attached terms and conditions work the same way, with regard to receiving them. reply litenboll 52 minutes agorootparentprevYes, that's true and it's good for those who know about it. It's not enough though, companies still have super easy sign ups and then refer to call customer service to unsubscribe (usually the case with cell phone plans for example). And many companies have no email or contact form, only a phone number available on their site. So there's still lots of room for improvement. reply vel0city 2 hours agorootparentprev> by any means you prefer I prefer to unsubscribe by writing it on a post-it note and sticking it in a public bathroom under the sink. That way I can always sue for them not doing it! reply misstuned 5 hours agoparentprevThe same goes for all services. I was able to sign up for an ISP service (in the UK) online very easily, with a few clicks and entries onto a form to enter my details, choose my installation date, choose my speed, etc. Fast forward a few years, I'm leaving that house and need to cancel the internet - snail mail letter needed. reply nanoservices 5 hours agorootparentThere is zero incentive for a company to invest in tooling and tech to make processes that lose them customers more efficient. This is something that has to be regulated and enforced. I just don't see a c-suit clamoring to spend money on making it easier to leave. reply tialaramex 4 hours agorootparentThere is a reason to invest in this, the rationale goes as follows: Some of my customers will legitimately need to cancel, unsubscribe, stop using, or whatever, but they like the product. If I piss these customers off, they may recommend against using it, and refuse to ever use it again so I should accept that they're leaving with grace and maybe they'll return later. You can offer to \"pause\" a subscription for example, \"Posted to Amundsen-Scott† for six months? Alas Swim Fun Inc don't have a pool there, but when you get back just hit resume and you can keep the same pricing, meanwhile we won't charge you\". But far too many \"business leaders\" are focused on short term gains at any cost and so this doesn't compute for them. They don't care that you currently like the product and would resubscribe when you get back from the pole, because that's a year or more away, they care about next quarter, and if you aren't income next quarter you're irrelevant to them, fuck you. † Amundsen-Scott is the name of the base at the South Pole of the planet. It's a cool place. But lots of services aren't available there or would make no sense. You can't live there permanently, so those people are coming back. reply mau013 1 hour agorootparentThis. In my case I enjoy reading The Economist and do not mind paying for it, but some years back I had to cancel my subscription (I was cutting back on expenses) and honestly I found that experience so much against the business values they preach that it has made me not subscribe again, even if it means not reading their publication. (Every few years I go to check if they have made it easier to unsubscribe, but last time I checked they still had the same practices) Edit: I can also imagine that I’m a minority and so it really pays off to keep doing this. reply reginald78 20 minutes agorootparentI avoid subscription services like the plague because of this (and other reasons). I can't know if they're going to do this kind of crap until it is to late. Even if some one reviewed services for this they could change at any time for the worse. So I just assume it will happen and try to limit getting into that bad arrangement as much as possible. reply usrbinnooo 2 hours agorootparentprevI was pretty sure we'd abandoned the \"but it would hurt the business and they'd change their ways\" fantasy years ago, because a) it doesn't, and be) they don't. How's Equifax doing these days? Oh yeah, totally fine. reply intended 47 minutes agorootparentprevI am also very surprised that this is the case in the UK. From my experience, it was very easy to cancel internet in the UK. As in nearly dead simple. reply unsupp0rted 4 hours agorootparentprevThe harder they make leaving, the less % chance that I'm ever coming back. But I suppose they know and don't care. reply al_borland 4 hours agorootparentprevI tried to delete a Sony account (I had 2). Their site said to talk to support to get this done. I waited for 45 minutes, finally got to someone and they said I can’t. When I tried to mention the support site, they disconnected me, throwing me back in a 45 minute line if I felt like being hung up on again. For a company that has been hacked multiple times, I find this unacceptable. reply litenboll 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's similar here in Sweden. Usually they require a call to support, officially. However, I think there is a law/policy that require them to accept unsubscriptions by mail/message, regardless of what they say on their website. I recently did this and it worked! Maybe there's something similar in the UK? reply eckesicle 4 hours agorootparentYes that’s right. You can unsubscribe by any which way you want. Mail, phone call, pigeon. Any message sent to any employee or office in anyway is deemed acceptable for giving notice for any service or contract. reply meindnoch 4 hours agorootparentprevCounter-anecdote: cancelling my Virgin Media plan was very simple. I've clicked through their online cancellation process, then they've sent me a prepaid return box for the modem, and that was it. reply ZeroGravitas 4 hours agorootparentI spent literally hours over several days on hold to cancel and when googling it this was widespread and hated. Possibly you were very lucky, or they've buckled to the pressure caused by previous anti-consumer BS. https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/dec/19/i-was-cut-off-... > Unlike providers who use the rival Openreach cable network, Virgin Media does not allow its six million broadband customers to cancel expired contracts online. Thirty days’ notice is required before any switch, compared with the 14 days’ notice required to switch Openreach providers.

I had procrastinated for months because I was sure I'd go through a real workout routine. I did have to call them but don't remember any particular pain getting through to someone and then it was just \"Your new bill will be [about half the old one). Return your rented voice modem. Have a nice day.\" Maybe it was because it was during COVID. reply gambiting 3 hours agorootparentprevNah they famously still do this thing where you have to give them 30 days notice and they will call you 2-3 times to get you to stay. reply tengbretson 4 hours agorootparentprevI had an internet service that could be signed up for on the internet, but required a phone call to cancel. During covid they could not staff their phone service properly so it was effectively broken (20 minute holds, getting booted from the queue, etc.), so I just closed the card and told them to pound sand. reply nerdjon 3 hours agoparentprevMy only concern about this is the signup processes that already take multiple pages anyways. Take cell phones or internet, I don't have an exact number but I feel like with those given all of the information I have to put in, various agreements, etc etc once my service is in my cart I generally have 3, 4, maybe more pages of stuff to go through. Is the \"as easy to cancel as it is to sign up\" showing me the same number of pages trying to convince me to stay? Sure at least in that case it is still online, but it leaves plenty of room for dark patterns. Could something that states something as simple as that, just lead to a slightly worse signup process in the hopes that they can then convince customers to stay longer with those dark patterns. It would be a gamble on the companys part, but could pay off. I realize no law will be perfect, but I worry that something that simple could be abused when it would likely just be better to make a law about unsubscribing in the first place that applies across the board. Edit: I was thinking about this more. But what exactly is \"as easy to cancel as it is to sign up\"? When I sign up for a service I am paying for at a minimum I had to create a username, a password, and put in my credit card. Maybe I had to validate my email and/or phone. Maybe I had to put in my address, validate I was a student, etc etc. Signing up is not a one click thing, so just stating that neither would canceling. I get the spirit of saying something like that, but with simplicity I feel like also opens up room for interpretation and it doing nothing to really help except for some extreme cases (like needing to call). But I also look at my gym membership, I could not sign up until I physically went in or at the very least talked to someone on the phone. That gives them the power to do the exact same thing when I want to cancel. reply intended 39 minutes agorootparentI think this counts as over thinking. Unsubscribing is MILES harder in many countries. The unsubscribe link is buried in some unknown sub menu, customer support dumps you, or the like. Trying to fatigue someone out of subscribing is a bad business model. If people want to leave, it should be dead simple to do so. reply litenboll 40 minutes agorootparentprevYeah I agree with this, it's a very good point. Of course a real law needs more narrow wording. The spirit of it should be more about not allowing companies to have different means for subscribing and unsubscribing. Then there can be additional rules that prevent them from convoluting the process more than necessary. reply sureIy 2 hours agoparentprev> As easy to cancel as it is to sign up I think that’s not enough in some cases. Signing up requires inputting a bunch of data; unsubscribing should be 2 clicks at most, no logins. reply fckgw 2 hours agorootparentHow would you unsubscribe from a subscription service without logging in and confirming your account? reply tracker1 11 minutes agoparentprevUntil they require you to dig out your CC and input the number and the cvv code to cancel, which shouldn't be needed, but hey, it's \"as easy\" as signing up. ;-) Oh, sorry, that's not the card you signed up with... what do you mean you don't have the card that expired last year that rolled over when you signed up? reply atoav 3 hours agoparentprevI still recall a big reputable newspaper that was approaching students with free sample subscriptions to their newspaper. The sign up was super simple, to end the subscription you had to do the telephone equivalent of getting through a maze blindfolded while sacrificing your first born when the stars aligned right. After that experience that news source is on my and many of my colleagues black lists. And we are the core demographic they would probably like to target. Yeah. reply lttlrck 3 hours agoparentprevWhy more than one-click? We already have plenty of examples of this working, everyone else needs to get on board. reply kwanbix 4 hours agoparentprevThis is how it works in Argentina. For at least 15 years IIRC. reply inglor_cz 5 hours agoparentprev\"As easy to cancel as it is to sign up\" Hm, I would prefer two-step sign up to one-step unsubscribe. reply pbasista 5 hours agorootparentWhy the asymmetry? And what do you have in mind when you refer to \"two-step sign up\"? reply inglor_cz 4 hours agorootparentFor my convenience; and by two-step sign up I mean \"enter my e-mail into a form, then receive a confirmation e-mail and click on a confirmation link to be actually subscribed\". reply fckgw 2 hours agorootparentAre you confusing this with email newsletter subscriptions? This is talking about paid membership services, the kind of thing where you need an account and often payment methods. reply inglor_cz 1 hour agorootparentYes :) Sorry. reply litenboll 5 hours agorootparentprevSure, but it's a minimum. Also, the incentive here is aligned with what's best for the customer, i.e. they probably want to make their two step subscription process to become one step which automatically gives the user an easier process to unsubscribe. reply BiteCode_dev 5 hours agoparentprevSo... EU laws? reply jkaplowitz 4 hours agorootparentWhat EU-wide law requires it to be as easy to cancel as to sign up? I’m sitting in Germany right now and I’m unaware of any such law - though it might very well be recent and not fully transposed into German law, or might be situational or not widely complied with. It’s a good idea though, absolutely. reply tomschwiha 4 hours agorootparentThere is a law that requires that subscriptions can be cancelled online within \"the click of a button\" with automatic confirmation. (since 2022) If no such option to cancel is implemented by the provider the minimum contract duration is void and you can cancel immediately. German reference: https://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/vertraege-reklamation/kue... reply mtmail 4 hours agorootparentprevWe have the regulation in Germany, but afaik it's not EU-wide. The \"Gesetz über faire Verbraucherverträge\" basically says that if something can be subscribed to easily online, then the company also has to provide an easy unsubscribe. It goes into detail how such a button should look like, how labelled, what data the confirmation page has to list and how fast the confirmation has to be (immediate). reply tomschwiha 3 hours agorootparentI believe the EU law sets the minimum required conditions for contracts (fair, not abusing the customer), but the individual EU-countries can implement more consumer friendly rules. reply patrickk 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's horrendus in Germany trying to cancel a mobile phone subscription, internet service, gym membership or the likes. You have to jump through hoops like sending a registered physical letter, 3 months before the end of the service period for it to be considered a valid cancellation (\"Kün­di­gung\"). Without this, you're forced into paying for another year. EU regulation is badly needed to cut out this anti-consumer nonsense. reply tomschwiha 4 hours agorootparentThis is no longer true, it is limited to a one month period (after a possible 2 year minimum contract to offer \"special discounts\") in advance and every contract can be cancelled online. reply echelon 5 hours agoparentprev> For example, to move loans from one bank to another you need some documents How would this work? The lender may have paid for your loan (and may not have even gotten the right to service the loan). How do they make their money back? What about the mortgage-backed securities market? reply litenboll 5 hours agorootparentMaybe I described it in a bad way. I'm talking about renegotiating the interest rate with another bank. So the original bank loan is not moved in practice, it's just paid back in full. It's law here in Sweden that the mortgage plan can't be changed (I.e. number of years etc) if you change bank, so the documents are related to this. reply Spivak 4 hours agorootparentAhh, this is called \"refinancing\" in the US. reply the__alchemist 5 hours agoprevAnecdotally: A: I get more spam than ever. What is especially annoying is that the majority of reputable companies do this. Order something? Sign up for an account? Set up an LLC? File a trademark? Boom: Spam emails UFN. B: It's easier to unsubscribe than ever: Often one-click at the bottom of the email, or let Gmail/Fastmail etc do it for you. Generally effective. One annoyance I find is the Our terms have been altered. Pray I don't alter them further loophole, where you will still get emails after unsubbing. There's only one company I tolerate marketing emails from (Pitviper sunglasses), and it's because the emails are funny. reply thinkingtoilet 5 hours agoparentI've stopped unsubscribing to emails I didn't sign up for and just send to spam. It hurts their \"reputation\" score and wastes their money (however small amount). I encourage people to stop unsubscribing and just send it to spam. reply mkoubaa 5 hours agorootparentI'm almost as severe. I look for an unsubscribe button in the email. I click it. If I am not immediately unsubscribed from everything, I mark the email as spam. reply mrWiz 4 hours agorootparentIf I get more emails after unsubscribing I file a complaint with the FTC, then forward the response I get from the FTC to support@.

Here I am, already giving you money, and you want to spam me?! Even after I clicked unsubscribe? The worst are the BS claims of \"account status emails\", which are just spam.

I would like to follow your path, but have been unable to without making significant compromises. reply ToucanLoucan 4 hours agorootparentprevUgh my student loans went to a new servicer who I swear to god is paid by the email sent to me. I get an email letting me know when the payment is coming out (hint: it's the same numeric day as last month, plus or minus a day to account for non-banking weekend days) and the amount (hint: it's the same amount it always is, because that's how payments work) and then I get an email from them after my payment completes and then I get an email from them every time someone changes a punctuation mark in the roughly 400 pages of horseshit that I signed when I was 18 years old to get an education, and of course the fucking MESSAGES. \"There's an important message in your inbox, please log in to check\" And then you go look and it's like \"the white house wants to alleviate student debt, if you don't want your debt discharged fill out this form\" And it's like... a) who in their right mind wouldn't want that b) there's no way in hell I'm getting my debt discharged, I make WAY too much fucking money c) this is a matter of public policy and developing news, why the fuck was this sent as a secure message reply ghaff 2 hours agorootparentWith respect to the first part of your comment, I'd much prefer overcommunication of financial transactions about to happen and acknowledgement that they did rather than the other way about. And some communication about changes in Ts&Cs is often required. Those often come by physical mail. A lot of people here probably prefer more notifications about things like credit card transactions. I don't personally but many do even if it means a lot more routine email. reply bbarnett 2 hours agorootparentThis is all well and good, if it can be turned off if set. People used to find out about financial transactions monthly with their bill in the mail. It's fine to have more info, but that doesn't mean it must be forced upon us. And the transactions described are not really out of the blue financial transactions. The first message is about transactions that happen every. single. month. There's no need to say \"we're going to do what you want us to do\". That's silly. An agreement was already signed to that effect. The person knows it's going to happen. It's just 100% wasted, useless info. And while I know you're responding to the 'first part' of the post, the communication I'm describing in my (GP) post, is about just random emails with no actual value. reply bbarnett 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is what gets me. Are you going to take out another student loan, because of engagement? EG, spam, and their name on your mind. Of course not! Yet there's a marketing (eg, engagement) department thinking up this junk. reply voytec 5 hours agorootparentprevI have different reasons for not doing it: unsubscribing usually requires opening a website riddled with tracking, thus running potentially dangerous code on your device. Secondly, it confirms that your address is active and that SPAM message was read. Unsubscribing from one garbage can result in being added on several other garbage spam lists. reply alisonatwork 5 hours agorootparentprevMe too. I don't care if it's a \"legit\" business. Unsolicited bulk email is spam, period. If I wanted to receive junk mail, I would have signed up for that explicitly, which I most assuredly did not, no matter how many other products or services I might have purchased from that sender in the past. reply FergusArgyll 5 hours agorootparentprevYes, I go a little further. If I get more emails than I consider acceptable (even if I signed up originally), I mark it as spam. call me mean, but this is my email address and if you're gonna send me endless spam emails which obviously no one actually wants, then you're spam. reply th3w3bmast3r 5 hours agorootparentprevSame - I've given up unsubscribing and sending it straight to spam.

I think this is quite disfavourable to consumers. reply jedberg 3 hours agoparentThat's exactly why it's done that way. Because the tax is different in every state, county, city, and sometimes an even smaller region. There is something like 2,500 different tax jurisdictions in the USA. It would be difficult for national brands (or even local brands) to do any marketing or advertising that includes prices, because they would either have to put a range on their ads, or possibly eat all their profit in some areas if they have the same price everywhere. With the advent of computers this should be more doable, but the brands also have strong lobbies to keep tax payments seperate. reply TehCorwiz 2 hours agorootparentMany other countries have all-inclusive prices. Most of Europe from my experience. I wonder, how do they handle it?

Because the tax is different in every state, county, city, and sometimes an even smaller region. There is something like 2,500 different tax jurisdictions in the USA. It's quite ridiculous. I played around once with the tax rate and boundary files [1] provided by the ~23 states that are in the Streamlined Sales Tax system. I remember finding several cases where a tax boundary ran through an office complex so the tax rate would be different between 123 Fake Street, Suite 100 and 123 Fake Street, Suite 200. This is very annoying because it means to compute the tax you need a full address. For online sales of downloadable digital goods tax is often the only thing you need a full address for. For the actual sale all you need is a credit card number, the card security code, the billing zip code, and an email address to send a receipt to. And actually you usually don't even need the security code and billing zip but not providing them may lead to higher fees due to increased fraud risk. Looking up tax by full address is annoying because the address people think they are at often doesn't quite match the official address for that location. They might use the wrong directional prefix or suffix, or put them on the wrong end, or give the local nickname people use for a street instead of the actual name, to give a few examples. I found a way that worked surprisingly well, despite that. I'd take the address as supplied by the user and find the zip code and the building number. I'd then select from the boundary database all locations that matched the zip and building number. So say the address is 123 NW Fake ST, Mycity, Mystate, 12345. I'd find all boundary file entries with zip 12345 and an address range that included 123. Note this just looks at number and zip, so would not include Fake ST but also any other street in that zip that includes house number 123. For each of those I'd make the full address from the boundary file: building number, then any direction prefixes, then street name, then any type suffixes (\"St\", \"Ave\", etc), then any direction suffixes, then city, then state, then zip. I'd then compute the Levenshtein distance between each of those and the address given by the user and take the one with the smallest distance. Anyone know how the companies that provide tax lookup services handle this? I assume they do something way more sophisticated than my hack described above.

At all. I can't unsubscribe to a wide variety things in an App Store. Indeed, one reason apps want to have control over their own payment processing is so they don't have to follow App Store rules for stuff like this. Moreover, App Stores are a bit of a local monopoly that has the power to dictate terms to their hosted apps. So the only way to solve this problem seems to be edicts from a controlling authority. reply artursapek 3 hours agoprevThis is great.

    "originBody": "Blitz: A lightweight, modular, extensible web renderer Blitz is a \"native\" HTML/CSS renderer built to support the \"Dioxus Native\" project. It is effectively a lightweight webview except that the JavaScript engine is replaced with a native Rust API which allows Rust reactivity / state management libraries like Dioxus to interface with it directly. Talk to us in: the #native channel in the Dioxus Discord It currenly has two frontends: An HTML/markdown frontend that can render an HTML string. This is useful for previewing HTML and/or markdown files but currently lacks interactivity. A Dioxus frontend that can render a Dioxus VirtualDom. This has full interactivity support via Dioxus's event handling. Blitz builds upon: Stylo (Firefox's parallel browser-grade CSS engine) for CSS resolution Vello + WGPU for rendering Taffy for box-level layout Parley for text/inline-level layout AccessKit for accessibility Winit for windowing and input handling Note: This repo contains a new version of Blitz which uses Stylo. The source code for the old version is still available on the legacy branch but is not under active development. Screenshots The Dioxus renderer: The HTML renderer (rendering google.com): Trying it out Clone this repo Run an example: cargo run --example google cargo run --example url https://myurl.com Other example available Add --release for better runtime performance Press Ctrl/Cmd + + / Ctrl/Cmd + - to change the scaling, press F1 to show layout rectangles Goals Blitz is designed to render HTML and CSS - we don't want to support the entirety of browser features (or at least we want to make all such \"extra\" features opt-in). In our opinion, the browser is bloated for the basic usecase of rendering HTML/CSS. We do intend to support: Modern HTML layout (flexbox, grid, table, block, inline, absolute/fixed, etc). Advanced CSS (complex selectors, media queries, css variables) HTML Form controls Accessibility using AccessKit Extensibility via custom widgets Notably we don't provide features like webrtc, websockets, bluetooth, localstorage, etc. In a native app, much of this functionality can be fulfilled using regular Rust crates and doesn't need to be coupled with the renderer. We don't yet have Blitz bindings for other languages (JavaScript, Python, etc) but would accept contributions along those lines. Architecture Blitz is split into several pieces: blitz-dom: The core DOM abstraction that includes style resolution and layout but not drawing/painting. Combines the best of Stylo and Taffy that allows you to build extendable dom-like structures. blitz: Adds a Vello/WGPU based renderer to blitz-dom dioxus-blitz: A dioxus integration layer for blitz. Render your Dioxus app using Blitz. Currently dioxus-blitz also contains the HTML renderer but this will likely be split out into it's own package in future. Status Blitz is currently experimental. We are actively working on bringing into a usable state but we would not yet recommend building apps with it.

AMA. One thing to note is it's not quite ready yet: - The text input and focus system are pretty basic - We don't support scrolling (other than the root viewport) - Complex CSS selectors like nth-child and :has aren't working correctly yet. - Event handling integration with Dioxus (the React-like framework that sits on top of Blitz) isn't robust or fleshed out yet (only clicks work, there is no preventDefault) - The currently networking is super-dumb and does synchronous requests on the main thread. We need proper async and/or multithreaded networking. - We have put very little work into performance - we're currently recomputing style/layout/paint every frame. - Relatedly: We have few dumb memory leaks where nodes are not cleaned up. We know where these are, we just haven't fixed them yet. - Less critical, but things like shadows, web fonts, calc, float layout, and form controls other than text input are missing (see README for more). All of these are basically a case of \"building a webview is a big task, and we haven't gotten around to that yet\". We're hoping to have something a bit more complete in 2-3 months time. There are some more screenshots here: https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz/issues/23 reply jokoon 9 hours agoparentPersonally, I would rather design a new document format, with simpler semantics, that is easier to render.

Markdown is a good example of compile-to-html format that has gained huge popularity. reply philistine 5 hours agorootparentAs a transitive format. There are no places full of Markdown documents to read and share, where Markdown is the final display format.

Some of my favourite thing about the web are the semantics. This like links that have common shortcuts across all sites (like open in new tab) and a rich contect menu (send to another device, archive at archive.org). I have extensions to translate text to find URL anchors in documents. If the web primatives where WebHID + WebGPU every site would lack any of these. Of course this would come from the Flutter people who don't seem to care about this. Flutter on web is completely unusable and often Android and desktop versions are barely tolerable. reply satvikpendem 3 hours agorootparentThere's no reason extensions can't be made for it as well, HTML and CSS in the browser is just rendered via Skia anyway, so it's not much different to keep the renderer but change out the underlying languages. This is in fact exactly what Flutter does. reply mananaysiempre 7 hours agorootparentprevBy the prominent semantic markup advocate and Web standards developer Ian “Hixie” Hickson, who now works on Flutter and, it seems, gave up on the Web. The article proposes a modern riff on the Flash VM more or less. reply satvikpendem 3 hours agorootparentThe HN link goes into depth on why he gave up on the web, it's quite an interesting read. reply mananaysiempre 2 hours agorootparentIt really is, it’s just that I don’t want to live in the world where his proposal is the main way to discover and deliver information. His solution to semantics going unused is motivated in the last paragraph, and I just can’t bring myself to feel any of the enthusiasm the writing attempts to convey: > The parts of the web that have actually delivered are the ephemerality and the security model, the indexability (but only for content, not apps), deep linkability, and the platform-independence. We can keep all those, and throw out the decades of legacy that's holding us back, and we will lose nothing, we will only gain as we unleash the kinds of amazing interfaces that developers can build when you give them the raw bedrock APIs that other platforms already give their developers. I also have to admit I simply don’t—can’t—trust a proposal to make the (path of least resistance of the) Web less inspectable when it comes from the general direction of Google, even when it’s honest-to-goodness Hixie writing one upon evidently deep reflection; the same way I don’t trust a proposal to make a compiler toolchain collect user data by default when it comes from that direction, even when it’s honest-to-goodness Russ Cox writing one upon evidently deep reflection. (In the case of Go telemetry, I still remember how Cox responded to a privacy-related question I raised on HN—but don’t even remember now—by proposing the organization maintain an anonymizing proxy for its many employees. Which was a fairly satisfactory solution, if you’re an organization and have many employees. And it seemed clear his mind had no other cases in its working set. Maybe it’s just something in the air there.) I don’t mean to pass judgment here, to be clear. Hixie in particular has done more to improve the open Web than most people whose explicit job it was to improve the open Web, let alone web programmers, let alone programmers in general (the only cohort of those to which I can lay even a vague claim of membership). I don’t even mean that my upfront bias here is correct or should be emulated by anybody. I only mean to warn you that I’m just unable to engage with the proposal without considering its source, most of all emotionally, so you should keep that in mind when I say it and its apparent excitement feel bleak, like a coat of bright paint on a rusty playground slide in the midst of a concrete Constructivist slum. reply satvikpendem 2 hours agorootparentHis proposal is more for web apps, not web sites that have information on them, so the way he talks about all of those topics, like \"we will only gain as we unleash the kinds of amazing interfaces that developers can build when you give them the raw bedrock APIs that other platforms already give their developers\" seems much more suited to, well, interface design, rather than informational conveyance in the form of a web page. On that aspect, I agree, it's not necessary to cram a document object model into an interface design model, which is where Flutter comes from, precisely understanding that fact, and where, it seems, all the new WASM and WebGPU etc renderers are coming from too. He also left Google yet still maintains his stance in the article, to my knowledge, if that's any consolation to you that he's not necessarily thinking about the topic from a Google lens, at least, not anymore. reply nicoburns 7 hours agorootparentprevThat's fair. One of the things that I hope Blitz's modular approach will enable is more experimentation around this kind of things. It should be quite easy to take the rendering support and add your own syntax or layout algorithms for example. How feasible this is in practice remains to be. I'd be interested to see/hear what your vision would look like. reply contrarian1234 6 hours agorootparentprevWhy not just use a markup (markdown adoc djot) + CSS?

I'm just now looking for a solution to capture screenshots of websites, ideally from a previously crawled representation. From what I can gather, all existing offerings just run a Chromium instance and request a screenshot from that, which is pretty expensive (both in operating and as a SaaS product). So, Blitz should be a pretty ideal fit for that, right? Can it run in headless mode and save a screenshot currently? reply nicoburns 12 hours agorootparentIt can't, but it'd probably only be a few hours work to add. We'd just need to plug the rendering library we're using into an image encoder rather than a windowing library. There might also be some extra work required to do tiling if you wanted a screenshot that is the full height of the HTML page (bigger than will fit in a single GPU texture), but I can't imagine that would be too hard. reply 9dev 12 hours agorootparentThat’d be an amazing extension with lots of potential to mix up the existing Screenshot aaS business. I’m no Rust dev, so I can’t help here, but I’ll follow the project closely! reply nkozyra 8 hours agorootparentGiven general css support is not complete, would you really want a screenshot of something that might look radically different on a commonly used browser? reply nicoburns 6 hours agorootparentI guess perhaps such functionality will be more useful when the CSS support is more complete? reply the_duke 9 hours agorootparentprevMany websites don't render properly anymore without Javascript. A pure \"html + css renderer\" would probably be of limited utility for screenshotting. reply nwienert 11 hours agorootparentprevYou can use Playwright with Webkit, which is much lighter weight than Chrome. reply TimTheTinker 9 hours agorootparentprevYou might also look into trying Prince XML. Its happy path is typesetting via HTML/CSS, but it may fit your use case as well. reply the_duke 9 hours agoparentprevOut of cursiosity, what's the motivation of combining a bunch of different components yourself over building on something like Servo or webkit? reply nicoburns 7 hours agorootparent1. Projects like Webkit are intimidating from both a codebase size and a commit frequency POV. We don't have the expertise or the engineering bandwidth to maintain such a solution. 2. We hope that by building a modular solution we might be able to lower the barrier to entry for building browser-like software. 3. We're a lot smaller. Servo is 100mb+. Blitz is 20mb out of the box. Potentially as small as 3.5 mb with optimizations. 4. We want to be a lot more customizable. Want to add your own layout algorithms? Image formats? Build your own native widgets with custom painting and accessibility? Fit into your existing render backend? Then we want that to be possible. Don't want SVG support? or AVIF support? Or network support? Or Float support? Then you should be able to disable it and not pay the cost for it. 5. We want our components to be usable in other contexts. For example Taffy, our layout library is used in several GUI frameworks. Many of our other dependencies are also generally usable. reply rapsey 9 hours agorootparentprevYou can't remove the JavaScript engine from Servo. reply mkl 8 hours agorootparentWhy would that be? It seems quite unlikely to me. reply nicoburns 7 hours agorootparentIt uses the GC from the JS engine for it's entire DOM implementation which definitely makes it tricky. There are also some other bits you'd probably want to rip out like gstreamer for media support. We looked at using Servo's layout support. But it isn't really designed to be used standalone (although it could be if that was prioritized!). And we'll probably add a Webrender rendering backend at some point (Blitz is designed to have pluggable renderers). reply rapsey 8 hours agorootparentprevBecause it is central. From what I understand the DOM is completely JS. Blitz is basically the project of removing JS from servo. reply sandGorgon 6 hours agoparentprevhave you built Blitz for others to build browsers on ? I build Wootzapp (https://github.com/wootzapp/wootz-browser) - we are kind of like Robinhood for data labeling. people can spend time labeling web data/images, etc in the browser and earn. Right now we are based on Chromium. Wondering if Blitz is looking to be the pluggable renderer for other browsers. P.S. we are on the mobile (android today and ios tomorrow). reply nicoburns 6 hours agorootparentWe've definitely built Blitz for other to build on. Whether it's feasible to build an entire browser on top of it... maybe. But for the being we are focusing primarily on use cases that don't need everything a full browser engine provides and can restrict themselves to a subset: - Application UIs - High-fidelity markdown previewing - Perhaps PDF rendering, etc. - Embedding web content within a wider system in an integrated way. Etc. It would be very cool if someone wanted to add actual JS scripting and DOM APis on top though. reply rerdavies 6 hours agoparentprevI get it. I did my last project with a Web UI because that's the only reasonable cross-platform UI rendering engine I could find. And on Linux, a far superior choice to GTK, which doesn't seems credible because it requires a complete reimplementation of your UI code on every major release, and QT which is held hostage by commercial interests, and licensing terms that are inscrutable. For a UI engine for native applications, it seems like a sensible strategy: use a layout language that developers are likely to already be familiar with. Hopefully, in the longer term, there will also be a Blitz-TML library with higher-level UI components as well. Good luck with this. It looks interesting. reply hougaard 11 hours agoparentprevHow about rendering with print specific CSS to images/pdf ? reply nicoburns 7 hours agorootparentImages is easy. Although we'd need to support the print-specific CSS in layout. PDF is more complex but definitely doable. It wasn't part of our initial plans but is rapidly making it's way up the priority list due to popular demand (and we are of course an open source project, so we'd be very open to people contributing PDF rendering support). reply wslh 8 hours agoparentprevCould you share what are the most complex engineering parts that you should deal with? Could you share your engineering documents even if they are just WIP? Personally I am interested in how engines like Blitz, Servo, et al could be built in the future using formal methods practices. For example, start with definitions and generate part of the system. Nowadays, this includes LLM but I see them more like great tools than AI systems. Also things like Z3 comes to my mind. BTW, some of my companies has a research branch on things like this. reply rob74 9 hours agoparentprevPersonally I wonder what the motivation behind choosing \"Blitz\" as the name was. Sure, it means \"flash\" or \"lightning\" in German, but it also has some pretty negative historical connotations. E.g. if you google \"blitz wikipedia english\", you get \"The Blitz\" as the first result, which refers to the bombing campaigns of the Nazis against Great Britain during WW2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz). Also, there is the term \"Blitzkrieg\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzkrieg), referring to the Nazi invasions of Poland and France. reply infotainment 8 hours agorootparentThat seems like kind of silly objection, why should a common German word be considered harmful because it was used for a bad thing one time? reply nicoburns 7 hours agorootparentprevIt's supposed to have connotations of speed. I think it's pretty commonly used in this way in English. reply atombender 7 hours agorootparentprevThe word is in common use, especially terms like \"ad blitz\", \"press blitz\", etc. One of the headlines in the New York Times yesterday was \"Summer Blitz Exemplifies Status of Remade Contest\". A search [1] reveals many uses. [1] https://www.nytimes.com/search?query=blitz reply miki123211 9 hours agoparentprevWhat's your story regarding accessibility? Done? Planned? \"we pretend disabled people don't exist until the government tells us otherwise\"? reply mkl 8 hours agorootparentFrom the readme: \"Blitz builds upon: [...] AccessKit for accessibility\" reply nicoburns 7 hours agorootparentprevWe have the basics (exposing an accessibility tree that is visible to screen readers, a keyboard controllable focus system). There's a lot more work to do be done to make it work well (but that's also true of Blitz in general). We're building upon https://github.com/AccessKit/accesskit which provides a cross-platform abstraction over the OS accessibility APIs. reply mwcampbell 3 hours agorootparentHi, lead AccessKit developer here. Thanks for prioritizing accessibility even at this fairly early stage of the project. reply haunter 8 hours agorootparentprevWhy are you so hostile? reply mwcampbell 4 hours agorootparentI think the hostility is understandable when you consider that blind and other disabled people, like myself (I'm partially blind) and the poster of that comment, live every day having to work around widespread indifference toward our needs. I'm not immune to it myself; see some of my older HN comments on GUI toolkit accessibility, before I started AccessKit. reply joshmarinacci 3 hours agoprevI built an open source project like this some years ago (holy carp! 20 years ago) called Flying Saucer. It was a pure Java HTML + CSS2 renderer. I imagined people would use it to render rich text UIs in games, but the killer use ended up being server side PDF generation. It was far easier to generate HTML and render to a PDF than to use the various PDF report generation APIs available at the time. Blitz looks cool. I'm excited to see more GUI libs in Rust. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Saucer_(library) PS: amazingly it is still being updated! https://github.com/flyingsaucerproject/flyingsaucer/releases... reply owenpalmer 13 hours agoprev> It is effectively a lightweight webview except that the JavaScript engine is replaced with a native Rust API Woah, this looks promising. Basically Tauri without JS in the loop? Music to my ears. reply nicoburns 13 hours agoparent> Basically Tauri without JS in the loop? Kinda, although Tauri uses system webviews, whereas we're building our own (partly on top of Servo components and other general purpose libraries, partly custom). In some ways we're closer to Sciter but without JS. reply afavour 6 hours agoparentprevI think Sciter is probably the better comparison: https://sciter.com/ It is a ground-up implementation of HTML and CSS rendering. IIRC it used to have its own programming language but now uses JS. I’ve long been interested in this kind of thing but haven’t actually played with Sciter in depth. Used to be that the licensing was a concern but looking at the site now it seems the terms have changed to be much more flexible. (also worth pointing out that if you want a system webview without JS… just disable JS on a system webview) reply nicoburns 6 hours agorootparentYes, Sciter is definitely pretty close. We think we can do better CSS support. Sciter has good CSS2 layout support, but only has it's own proprietary equivalent to Flexbox. Our CSS2 support is currently pretty patchy, but we have good Flexbox and CSS Grid support. We also have full support for things like media queries and css variables which I don't believe Sciter supports. Regarding \"just disable the JS\": You can, but then you won't have scripting support. Blitz still has scripting support without JS using https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus which is a react-like UI framework but in Rust. reply yencabulator 3 hours agorootparentprevSciter is not open source, so it's in a whole different category, not applicable to many many things that interest people on HN. reply OtomotO 13 hours agoparentprevno, tauri uses the native web view, so different per platform. Blitz is an own renderer reply dgb23 9 hours agoprevThis project looks very useful at a glance. Create native applications that use the widely popular HTML/CSS paradigm for layout, but leave out much of the heavyweight stuff that a full JS/DOM/browser API implies. This looks like it can enable very large improvements over packaging browser engines like electron etc. do. Funnily enough, I just recently listened to Casey Muratori on Richard Feldman‘s podcast, where they where extremely critical of CSS. Some of the stories they told, like having to prerender and dynamically measure web pages in order to achieve some very simple layout relationships hit right at home. Writing CSS feels, as Muratori said, more like presenting a case in the court of law, instead of building upon simple primitives. Now there’s of course a very widespread need or want that is met by this project. Not just in terms of familiarity but also compatibility and the fact that „happy path CSS“ is incredibly productive. But maybe there’s an opportunity to provide a simpler, general layer that a user of this can drop down to. Perhaps the authors can find inspiration by looking at CSS houdini, which tries to make CSS extensible via a JS API. Or maybe that’s what they mean by „Custom Widgets“? reply nicoburns 6 hours agoparent> Create native applications that use the widely popular HTML/CSS paradigm for layout, but leave out much of the heavyweight stuff that a full JS/DOM/browser API implies.

I suspect JS for layout will be too slow in most cases. But this is an area in which we have an advantage with our API being in Rust. And our layout engine Taffy (https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy) is already highly modular. Custom widgets would go beyond just layout and allow for fully custom layout, paint, accessibility, event handling, etc similar to a widget in a traditional GUI toolkit like GTK or Cocoa. I also have a proposal to add a new unit to CSS itself (inspired by how many non-web UI systems do layout), which has the potential to greatly simplify web layout in the common cases https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/8267. It's been on the back burner for a bit, but I should really get back to it at some point (I really want to actually implement the algorithms). reply philistine 5 hours agoparentprevWe need a strict CSS that removes the cruft and promises improvements in performance. I don't know why the browsers haven't offered it yet. Like just remove float. reply MrJohz 4 hours agorootparentFloat is necessary for some layouts, particularly documents where you might have a lot of text that wraps around a handful of images. I don't believe it's possible to implement that without floats (at least not without some clever shenanigans). I think most attempts to simplify CSS are going to fail in this way. Almost all of CSS right now is useful for something or other — there's actually not a huge amount of cruft in there (in comparison to, say, JS, where a lot of built-in APIs and functions should not be used, or need to be used in the right way). It's just that CSS gets used for everything from applications (where grid/flex are mostly enough) through to documents (where floats and tables become more important). reply Fire-Dragon-DoL 13 hours agoprevInteresting. Just today I was looking for wkhtmltopdf replacement after a horrible experience with puppeteer and trying to run chromium headless (do NOT try to run it with jemalloc in LD_PRELOAD). I did solve the problem, but I preferred the simplicity of a renderer. reply nicoburns 12 hours agoparentYou're not the first person to show interest in the PDF rendering use case. I think we'd probably need better support for some of the print-orientated CSS properties and page-based layout (for splitting layout across multiple discrete pages and controlling where page breaks occur), but it's definitely something that we ought to be able to support at some point. reply RamblingCTO 12 hours agorootparentYou'd be a hero to a lot of people for supporting that. Current options for basic PDF reports suck. You essentially have to run Chrome (at scale possibly) for such a basic use case. reply nicoburns 12 hours agorootparentIt's kinda early, but we're looking at collaborating with https://typst.app/ (a modern LaTeX alternative) on this. They already have some of the low-level PDF writing infrastructure in place, and are working on something higher-level that we're hoping to use.

It would certainly require you to compute your own layout, but you.normally want that in a tabular report anyway.

Switched to Firefox Headless and these issues stop happening, in fact, switching to Firefox made the renderer ~3x FASTER than Chromium Headless! The Blitz project seems very interesting and is actually what I needed, because I'm using a headless browser as an alternative because rendering everything manually using Java Graphics2D would be a pain because the thing I'm rendering has a bit of a complex layout and I really didn't want to reinvent the wheel by creating my own layout engine. reply cedws 11 hours agoparentprevCheck out gotenberg[0], it might fulfil your needs.

Would love to use it in my c++ projects. One thought that came to my mind: How is the performance? Could you render a relatively complex page at high frames per seconds? I usually use ImGUI which is excellent to display real-time data without even thinking about performance issues. Compared to Chromium's web rendering which burns my CPU already at 10FPS simple DOM text updates, this could be a game changer. reply nicoburns 6 hours agoparent> How is the performance? Currently terrible. But we've put no effort into optimization, and build upon some pretty fast dependencies so there is potential for much better. I suspect we'll never beat Chromium in a \"fair fight\", but there is potential to enable things that just aren't possible in Chrome (much more powerful canvas-like APIs for example). reply bigbones 11 hours agoprevNot a comment on Blitz itself, but had never heard of Dioxus before. Is there some unwritten rule about compiles-to-wasm type frameworks where they never actually show a demo or have their own site self-hosted in the framework? Seen this like 5 or 6 times now. I see some wasm file loaded on the Dioxus home page, but it's not clear where it's being used if at all reply nicoburns 10 hours agoparentDioxus's site is self-hosted, but it supports server-side rendering (with hydration), so the WASM bundle is only used for interactive functionality. There are plans for a video demo in the works. Is there anything particular that you'd like to see. reply Woshiwuja 12 hours agoprevCould be cool using it with a backend + htmx. But i guess JS engine is not even in the mix, so i wonder how you could do that reply eterps 12 hours agoparentThat would be legendary. > But i guess JS engine is not even in the mix Ideally a web renderer would support HTMX natively. The general idea is that HTMX supports features that make HTML more complete: - Why should only&be able to make HTTP requests? - Why should only click & submit events trigger them? - Why should only GET & POST methods be available? - Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen? Another way of thinking about it is that HTMX makes HTML elements less restrictive and more generic. If a web renderer takes that into account in its design, it could end up simpler. reply nicoburns 6 hours agorootparentNatively supported HTMX would be cool. Blitz is modular enough that this could probably be implemented as it's own wrapper around some of the core crates. And it wouldn't necessarily need to be coupled to the general HTML renderer. reply 3523582908 3 hours agorootparentprevI really appreciated this way of looking at HTMX!

Which we hope will appeal to people who might otherwise use something like electron but want something lighter weight. We're also building it in a modular fashion, which we hope will enable the engineering work we're putting to be reused for many other use cases.

So the idea is to pull bits out of Servo properly abstracted instead, while also making use of other well-engineered libraries in the Rust ecosystem. And then build our own where that isn't possible. One of the main thing's we're building ourselves is layout, which is partly because when it comes to \"modern\" layout algorithms like Flexbox and CSS Grid (which are particularly important for application UI use cases) our support is already quite a bit better than Servo's. reply atoav 13 hours agoprevThis is what we need.

    "originBody": "Apple’s requirements are about to hit creators and fans on Patreon. Here’s what you need to know. August 12, 2024 Apple is requiring that Patreon switch to their iOS in-app purchase system starting this November, or risk being removed from the App Store. Here’s what’s coming, and what you can do about it. Patreon exists to let creators make what they love for their biggest fans, and earn an income doing it on their own terms. Everything we build is to make those two things easier for creators. For you. Unfortunately, Apple is requiring us to switch over to their in-app purchase system for all iOS transactions or else risk being kicked out of the App Store altogether – and their in-app purchase system is not built with our same level of creator-first flexibility. In situations like this — where a partner is forcing us into a change that we don't believe is best for creators — we use these three principles to guide our decisions: Transparency – Communicating to you early and clearly to help you understand exactly what is happening and what your options are. Control – Giving you a clear understanding of the tradeoffs, so that you can decide what’s right for your business. Stability – Making sure that you’re able to maintain your earnings and continue to grow your business throughout this process. Apple’s requirements As we first announced last year, Apple is requiring that Patreon use their in-app purchasing system and remove all other billing systems from the Patreon iOS app by November 2024. This has two major consequences for creators: Apple will be applying their 30% App Store fee to all new memberships purchased in the Patreon iOS app, in addition to anything bought in your Patreon shop. Any creator currently on first-of-the-month or per-creation billing plans will have to switch over to subscription billing to continue earning in the iOS app, because that’s the only billing type Apple’s in-app purchase system supports. Before we go any further, we want to be crystal clear about one thing: Apple’s fee will not impact your existing members. It will only affect new memberships purchased in the iOS app from November onward. Here’s everything you need to know to navigate this change in the least disruptive way possible. Navigating Apple’s fee We’ve been working closely with creators to figure out the best way to help you avoid earnings disruptions stemming from Apple’s 30% App Store fee. Based on creator feedback, we've built an optional tool that can automatically increase your prices — only in the iOS app — to offset the cost of Apple's fee. This way, you’ll continue to earn at least the same amount per membership as you do on all other platforms. That said, you deserve the chance to decide whether that’s something you want. So, while the automatic price increase is the default option, you also have the choice to keep your prices the same and pay the 30% fee from your earnings. We don’t recommend this, because it means you’d earn less per membership on in-app iOS transactions – but ultimately we believe it's important to give you agency to make your own decisions. Obviously, neither of these solutions are ideal. But remember, Apple’s fees are only in the iOS app. Your prices on the web and the Android app will remain completely unaffected. You can always send your fans to this Help Center article which explains the iOS in-app fees relative to other platforms, so they can better understand the implications of where they choose to make their purchases. In any case, the decision you end up making doesn’t have to be final: you can change how you apply the fee at any time. For a breakdown of fees and earnings check out our Help Center article. Navigating Apple’s billing requirement Patreon is home to an incredible range of creators, all with unique circumstances and billing needs. Apple’s in-app purchase system, on the other hand, only supports Patreon’s subscription billing model. Apple has also made clear that if creators on Patreon continue to use unsupported billing models or disable transactions in the iOS app, we will be at risk of having the entire app removed from their App Store. Apple’s billing mandates mean that if you’re on a first-of-the-month or per-creation billing model, your membership will no longer be available to fans in the iOS app starting this November until you switch over to subscription billing. As a result of Apple’s mandates and in order to make sure that you can continue getting new members in the iOS app, we've started a 16-month-long migration process to bring all creators onto subscription billing by November 2025, supported by a roadmap of new features and tools to make sure the billing model works for you, your community, and your business. To be clear, this means that first-of-the-month and per-creation billing models will be discontinued in November 2025. Most creators on Patreon use subscription billing. Over the past few years, we’ve slowly rolled it out, tackling each hurdle that has come up to ensure that the migration is not disruptive for creators. That’s the way we like to roll out products. Unfortunately, because of Apple’s timelines and constraints, we can’t continue to do it this way. Instead of helping creators move to subscription billing if and when they feel like it’s right for them, we’re now forced to migrate all creators on Apple’s timeline. How this change will affect you depends on your current billing model. If you’re not sure what billing model you’re on, you can find out in your settings. Subscription billing – You do not have to make any changes to your billing model and can adjust how you handle Apple's fees at any time. First-of-the-month billing – In order to let you keep earning in the iOS app, we are going to automatically switch you over to subscription billing beginning in November 2024. However, if you’d like more time, you can delay your migration in your settings to keep your current billing model until November 2025. To be clear: even if you delay your migration, Apple’s requirements still apply. If you have not switched to subscription billing by this November, your fans will not be able to purchase new memberships in the iOS app. If you delay the migration but then change your mind, you can migrate to subscription billing at any time in your settings. Per-creation billing – Because this is such a big change to how you run your business, our Product Support will offer 1-1 support to help you migrate, which takes more time. You will be able to keep your current billing model until November 2025, at which point you’ll be migrated to subscription billing automatically. However, Apple’s requirements still take effect in November 2024. If you have not switched to subscription billing by this November, your fans will not be able to purchase new memberships in the iOS app. You can start the migration process in your settings. The road forward We want to do absolutely everything we can to make sure that these changes are as smooth as possible for you, your fans, and your business. We didn’t choose this path, but we’re focusing our resources on making subscription billing an even better experience for creators and fans. This will take time and we’re committed to making it happen for every creator. We’re working with creators who have already successfully navigated this process to make how-to videos, FAQs, and articles in our Newsroom and Help Center. We’re bringing together communities of creators on first-of-the-month and per-creation billing models over on our Discord to talk about migration tips and best practices. We’re keeping you up to date through emails, web and mobile notifications, and reminders. We’re continuing to advocate for you with Apple, and everywhere else. And we’re gathering your feedback every step of the way to make the process even better. If you have any questions, the Patreon team will be available on Discord from August 12th at 9am to August 16th at 5pm Eastern time for a Q&A.

The whole point of per-creation is that it allows me to take time off, and only charge people when I release something, thus incentivizing me, and being fair to my supporters. I'm really annoyed by this change, and will start pushing back, but if it happens as planned, I may be forced to switch to another platform, or come up with some other solution. reply AlexandrB 48 minutes agoparentApple has quietly been one of the biggest culprits in the proliferation of subscription software. They still don't support upgrades/upgrade pricing. Subscriptions are also the easiest way to implement a software demo or trial in the App Store. Finally they use their control of the App Store to coerce anyone doing something different than monthly/yearly subscriptions into that model (as we see here). It sucks big time. reply baby 12 minutes agorootparentI really hate how the current pattern is 1. Download seemingly cool app on iOS (free with potential payments) 2. Go through a 30min quizz 3. Required to subscribe for $150/year to start using the app It’s not free, it’s false advertising reply derefr 43 minutes agorootparentprev> They still don't support upgrades/upgrade pricing. What would this mean, exactly? You can sell people a demo→full-version permanent unlock as a one-time purchase, same as you can sell DLC in a game. And you can also have subscription tiers, where you get more features out of the higher tiers of subscriptions. And you can, in theory, freely mix these — e.g. charging someone a subscription for the base version, and then charging them a one-time fee to unlock a specific feature. If you want, you could even charge for app features as consumables (just like F2P games do) — where you pay to have a block of credits that you use up, or you pay for one month and then have to buy it again when it runs out. What's the missing revenue model here? reply saratogacx 33 minutes agorootparentThe model is the \"old school\" model for software sales. The first version you sell to a user at full price and offer a discount for upgrading (something like 40% off). It lets the customer pick when they feel the value prop is worth the cost and lets you offer a loyalty incentive to the user. Right now the choice is \"keep paying for it to keep working\" or \"fully price for every upgrade\". reply rdsnsca 11 minutes agorootparentBundles can be used for upgrade pricing, you put the new version up for full price (ie. $20) and and a bundle with the new and old version (ie $30, for a 50% discount on it) for those who own the old version. When you buy a bundle you don't pay for the one you own. reply raybb 41 minutes agorootparentprevWhat's missing is you pay for Adobe Photoshop CS2 and it's yours forever. Then when CS3 comes out you can upgrade with a nice discount. reply derefr 31 minutes agorootparentAh, alright. There's nothing actually stopping you from doing this — it requires two things: 1. either a third-party licensing server (and thus some SSO auth system — but just require Apple's own SSO for it and it'll still be a clean-ish workflow) to share/sync the transaction status from one app to the other; or a local Group Container plus logic in each app to write the transaction statuses fetched for the given app into the group container for the other app to read 2. never charging for the app as a whole, but instead breaking your app's pricing down into a set of IAP-purchased feature entitlements (whether charged for individually, or as a bundle, the important part is that each entitlement has its own price.) Then, making the new version just a superset of the features of the old version — and so, when you're buying the old version, you're buying features A+B+C; and then when you're buying the new version (with the app being able to see whether or not you've bought the old version), new customers are buying A+B+C+D+E, while existing customers are buying D+E. --- Note that there's an even easier way to do this (and I think this is the way Apple would prefer you do this): don't release V2 as a separate app from V1. Instead, have V1 auto-update to a v2.0.0 release — which converts the V1 app into a launcher with an \"edition\" (major version) selector. Either compile in both the V1 and V2 codebase into this app, or better yet (for download/on-disk size), package separate V1 and V2 \"engines\" as executable DLC packages, submitted to Apple for review along with the app, downloaded on-demand when the app needs to run them. With this approach, the app would either start up the first time still within V1, and allow/offer people the option of \"seamlessly upgrading\" the app to V2; or the app would start up with an \"edition launcher\" UI that allows people a choice. (And either way, you could offer the ability at any time to freely switch between V2 and V1, re-launching the app with the other engine enabled. Like dual-booting Operating Systems, but at the app level.) Here, you could charge for the V2 \"upgrade\" ahead-of-time, before allowing the user to switch over to the V2 engine; or you could allow the user to switch between V1-fully-licensed and V2-demo modes (or even between V1-demo and V2-demo modes), where purchasing for each edition is separately available within that edition's UX. The expectation here is that all the user's existing feature entitlements would keep working as long as they continue to use the V1 engine — as you said, the V1 engine was a one-time purchase, and so even with this edition-launcher abstraction introduced in v2.0.0 of the app, V1 itself should still keep working for them forever. The benefit of doing this multi-editioned-shared-app approach, together with IAP feature entitlements, is that V2 can inherit some of the V1 entitlements, and then simply charge for the V2-novel entitlements. So V2 gets discounted for V1 purchasers inherently, by the fact that by buying V1, they've already bought half of the components of the V2 purchase-bundle. reply CodeWriter23 5 minutes agorootparent@jayd16 - it’s been a few years since I read the Apple Developer Agreement but at that time downloading code and executing it within your app was forbidden by the agreement. A sensible security safeguard IMO. CodeWriter23 8 minutes agorootparentprevSo whereas authors used to ship a new version, and let people upgrade to that version at a discount, the author now assumes the burden with each new release of maintaining and testing V1 (that’s with all the feature flags turned off) as well as every feature flag between V1 and Vcurrent turned on. One at a time. Sounds like insanity to me. reply jayd16 11 minutes agorootparentprevHave you actually done this? Is there a common example on the app store? When did it become possible to download additional executable bundles on iOS? reply giancarlostoro 23 minutes agoparentprevThe only way to put an end to this is if more people stop installing apps that are just website skins, and just use the open web instead. reply xelamonster 2 minutes agorootparentYeah, though the problem with this is that from my experience with Android, the web version of Patreon is practically unusable. Not that the app is much better, they seem determined to come up with the most horrific UX anyone could imagine across all platforms, but it at least can somewhat consistently handle playing the podcasts I subscribe to without cutting out every five minutes. reply cesarb 1 hour agoparentprevI've seen some creators on Patreon \"pause\" their monthly subscription when they have nothing to release on a given month, so that patrons won't be billed for that month. That could be a workaround for your use case. reply danShumway 1 hour agorootparentDo we know whether or not iOS's subscription model supports pausing? I guess I assume Patreon would mention if it didn't. reply HeatrayEnjoyer 1 hour agorootparentnext [2 more] [flagged] milesskorpen 1 hour agorootparent... if that is supported by Apple. Apple subscriptions aren't triggered. reply dannyobrien 48 minutes agoparentprevI don't understand why Patreon has to drop the per-creation model. Can they not just not offer that on iOS, and continue it on other platforms? (Perhaps with a \"convert from susbcription to per-creation\" feature online?) reply Uvix 40 minutes agorootparentUser confusion - if they block users from subscribing to those creators on iOS they will inevitably have support tickets to deal with it. Hence their 16-month project to remove non-iOS-compatible plans. reply rk06 41 minutes agorootparentprevMost likely because this feature existed on iOS before reply jkaplowitz 2 hours agoparentprevIt’s bad, yes. It would be good if Patreon allowed sticking with the billing systems which Apple is forbidding, but I do understand that they may no longer be able to justify the business expense of maintaining them given the anticipated changes in usage patterns. Practical suggestion: Maybe you can project a certain number of releases per year, reduce that projection slightly to give yourself a margin of flexibility, announce that target to your supporters, be explicit wit them that the rate of output throughout the year will be uneven, and then charge a monthly subscription price of 1/12 of the total price for your annual target output? Assuning a good projection would smoothly have approximately the same financial outcome for everyone as the status quo in most cases. I can think of ways in which this could be gamed, but most of those who would want to bother gaming it are probably cash-poor enough that you may not mind, or if too many people do this to preserve your financial objectives I can also think of workarounds for most of the potential abuses. reply bkraz 1 hour agorootparentYes, it's a reasonable workaround. I believe Patreon also allows creators to \"pause\" their account, suspending payments for an indefinite amount of time. So, I could just keep the account paused, then unpause for a month when I make a video. Although, I believe that Patreon doesn't want the per-creation model themselves, since charging the same amount each month is simpler, and easier to project revenue, etc, so they are probably just bundling this unpopular change with the Apple announcement. reply HeatrayEnjoyer 1 hour agorootparentSo why is Patreon doing this if even they don't like it? reply bluGill 1 hour agorootparentPatreon doesn't have a choice. Apple is too large to give up having an iOS app - too many customers will just walk away instead of using the alternative (or so they think - but I don't blame them for not being willing to experiment - if they are right it will cost a lot of customers) Well there is a choice, but it is questionable if suing will or will not result in any change. Even if they win in court it will be several years and millions of dollars in legal fees, and it isn't clear they will win. reply stavros 1 hour agoparentprevI think the platform you should switch to here is Android. This is Apple's fault, Patreon doesn't seem like it likes the changes any more than you do. reply spullara 1 hour agorootparentdo you think that they can switch their customers platform? this comment doesn't make any sense at all. reply SilkRoadie 1 hour agorootparentDoes the app give any benefit over the web? Asking customers to use the browser over the dedicated app doesn’t seem unreasonable. reply input_sh 1 hour agorootparentApple forbids even mentioning alternative payment methods within the app. reply InsomniacL 1 hour agorootparentprevDoes apple allow that? I think there are rules about telling people not to use IOS method. Not sure if that would extend to content displayed in the app too from creators? reply Arainach 1 hour agorootparentTake Apple out of the loop entirely. Why does Patreon need an app? Have users go through the website. Send them updates when people post new content. I've never used the Patreon app on either Android or iOS. I support a number of creators and I have no idea why I'd want an app. Money is taken from my account. Receipts are sent to my email. Articles from creators are sent to my email, and if they're long enough I click a link and read the full article (or view the pictures) on the website. reply lozenge 38 minutes agorootparentThe app's useful for audio posts. But mostly it's just an extra chance for them to make money. Push notifications, the home screen icon, etc. Most people I know, their inbox is barely functional due to the marketing emails, and they're reliant on features like Gmail's \"Important\" which only highlights real people, not Patreon content. You're not the average user, and if the average user gets a billing email and hasn't bothered to read their content email, visit the site or open the app, they are more likely to end their subscription. reply consteval 2 minutes agorootparent> visit the site or open the app There's another erm... \"creator oriented\" Patreon-like service that works entirely through the web. Specifically to avoid Apple and Google's cut. And they seem wildly successful, although perhaps the type of content may influence user's decisions. SirMaster 18 minutes agorootparentprevCan't you do all those things with a PWA? What does the Patreon app do that a PWA can't? reply layer8 1 minute agorootparentAside from many users not being familiar with PWAs and not wanting to install them, I believe they’d also have to drop support for older iOS versions, as for example PWA push notifications were only added in iOS 16.4. abudimir 50 minutes agorootparentprevExactly what I do, subscribe through the web. Don't need another app on the phone. Subscribe and forget. reply bluGill 1 hour agorootparentprevSure Apple allows it. However it is much easier to have a good UI experience with a custom app than a web app. Some people also think they must have an app for everything and so even if there is a good web experience they will demand the app anyway. reply heavyset_go 1 hour agorootparentprevGoogle forces apps on the Play Store to use Google's payment methods and give them a 15% to 30% cut of revenue, as well. You can sideload, but the duopoly exists and they're shaking 99.9% of users down for every dime they can get out of them. reply omoikane 59 minutes agorootparentMy understanding is that Patreon does not use Google's payment system and isn't subject to a cut of the revenue. This is why the article says \"Your prices on the web and the Android app will remain completely unaffected\". reply stavros 1 hour agorootparentprevTrue, but Android at least allows alternative app stores, and there are a few. Obviously it's not as easy as the native store, but if enough developers are dissatisfied, there is a way out. reply gedy 1 hour agorootparentprevI guess I'm having a hard time understanding why a Patreon app is even needed or wanted.

I back a couple of patterns that are a per-video model, so if the content creator produces 2 videos I'm charged 2x $amount that month. If they produce nothing I'm charged nothing. Apple doesn't provide a way of doing this. In the scenario you described I'd have to monthly count up how many videos said content creator produced and manually submit an order through the app...

And since a 30% price increase deincentivizes purchases for customers, they'll have less purchases. Or, of course, eating the 30% fee yourself deincentivizes you to use the platform (or upload content as regularly) if you opt for that one I'd say it's a loss for everyone involved except for Apple.

With the per creation model, I have no problems supporting them but if it's billed monthly then the price becomes a lot steeper. Alternatively they could reduce the cost to support them but then the fees becomes much higher for both the creator and patreon (29c + 5% IIRC). reply ncr100 1 hour agorootparentAgreed - the market will respond to these higher costs in a predictable manner.

Everything Cook does as a businessman is just the \"maximally extended\" version of what Jobs either already did on a smaller scale, or had been planning on doing before dying.

Going into a court of law and saying that a company with 27% market share in phones and 13% market share in PCs is a \"monopoly\" is almost on the level of being insulting to the justices. Judges and attorneys are not being corrupt bribe-takers when they laugh us out of court for making that argument. They are just following the law. There's not corruption involved. People seem loathe to accept the fact that it's time to go the other route, where you just change the laws. Apple is not now, and realistically, probably never will be, a monopoly. Antitrust and monopoly laws do not address what Apple is, and it's time to either make laws that do address what Apple is, or just be honest and say we don't, as a legal system, have any issue with what Apple is. But this political theater where you make an issue of what Apple is, and then try to address it in court knowing that it won't work is getting really old.

I’m not sure whether or not Apple is a monopolist, but I certainly think there are some arguments. reply wpm 3 minutes agorootparentUS Antitrust law generally is about pricing, collusion (over pricing or market access), and competition more so than just monopoly power. It is straight up not illegal to be a monopoly, only to abuse the position. I'm surprised there haven't been more attempts at a \"tying\" argument against Apple's App Store and their platforms, but I'm also not a lawyer. It has what looks like a pretty clear, long history of being considered an anti-competitive practice by the courts. You can buy a Brother printer and not have to buy paper or toner from them, why should I have to buy my apps from Apple? And to be clear, that is precisely how Apple thinks of the relationship between the user and the app. Apple owns that relationship. They mediate. They manage. They facilitate. No one else. Users don't buy apps. Users pay Apple. Apple pays the app developers. goosedragons 9 minutes agorootparentprevYup, and at the time of the Paramount Decree the movie studios had 17% of theaters and 45% of film revenue.

Whether that is enought to make a monopoly claim is debatable, but I assume it is enough to argue abuse of dominant market position. Regarding your laws paragraph, I do agree that \"free market\" doesn't really work at the level that the US currently is.

In some markets (e.g. search) they have dramatically more market share, but 27% of phones is still high enough to have some market power. Antitrust doesn't care about the market share, it cares about actions taken to restrain competition. Government-granted monopolies (e.g. copyright law) have partial antitrust carve-outs: I can't sue Disney for owning the copyright over their own films[0] even though that's extremely anti-competitive. Apple was savvy and couched their defense around their ownership of iOS: i.e. \"you can't tell us how we sell our OS\". Google could not avail themselves of that argument in the Epic case because they had explicitly open-sourced Android. But that's not the biggest problem. The Google lawsuit is unique in that not only did a lot of Google's own internal e-mails basically spell out exactly what crimes they were committing, but they also got caught spoliating evidence[1] by aggressively pushing relevant persons in the company to turn off chat history and recording functionality that was legally required to be enabled. In contrast, most of the decision making at Apple was \"whatever Jobs thought was best\" and people just did what he said. You can't subpoena a corpse. And while there were internal tech emails discovered in the Apple case, none of them were as damning as the Google ones, at least by the standards of a legal system that considers monopolies to be OK as long as you can pretend to be a starving artist. As for games consoles, the argument[2] is that consoles are special-purpose devices while iPhones are computers. I personally disagree with this, consoles have \"apps\" now just like phones and they have the exact same positioning that allows them to gain supra-competitive profits like Apple does. [0] More peripheral claims, such as having a monopoly over theatrical distribution, can and have give rise to an antitrust lawsuit. You have to prove that the market power they are using is above and beyond the market power the government intended them to use. [1] \"spoliate\" as in, illegally destroy evidence relevant to ongoing litigation. [2] Provided by Epic, oddly enough. I know they argued it to try and narrow down Apple's market definition, but I also suspect that was to avoid console manufacturers asserting some kind of universal default[3] / reverse class solidarity move and pulling Fortnite off PSN/Xbox/eShop until Epic drops the Apple lawsuit.

He cared about developers - the 30% rate, when he introduced it, was better than any other rate in the industry and was seen as a screaming deal. Before he died, it would have been unfair for Amazon to be getting around the rate while small developers had to pay it. Nobody, in 2011, was calling the rate exorbitant. At the time, your competition (publishing on PC) basically required calling a publisher and agreeing to a 50%-60% fee. Same for Verizon and \"dumb\" phones - every carrier had their own app store and they all charged 50% or more. reply Longhanks 3 minutes agorootparentBoth him getting fired and possibly dying earlier are directly related to the fact that the man does not easily change his mind.

The fact that Apple doesn't want their customers to know they are paying more is an interesting wrinkle though. reply nicolas_t 1 hour agorootparentThat's funny, I actually hate Apple's subscriptions because they are a pain to cancel. My wife has an iphone, she travels regularly to different countries for work. Because apps on apple store regularly have country restrictions (apps are not available in different countries), she has multiple apple accounts to deal with that. Now this is also a problem with Android (and it's the fault of the app developers), but Android make switching to a different account easy. Apple, doesn't. So, when you have 3-4 apple accounts and want to cancel subscriptions, it's a pita since you need to logout and login to whichever account has the subscription. Now, you might think that's not a typical use case, but I can assure you that in South East Asia, a lot of iphone users have multiple accounts. One recurring thing about Apple products is that they are designed by people who are not internationally minded (see for example the fact that you can't change the currency when using apple pay in a website and recalculate the totals without stopping the entire flow, or the fact that dual sim in iphones is an after thought and badly designed) reply imchillyb 14 minutes agorootparentWhat you’ve described is not an Apple problem but a specific use case scenario that is in direct violation of Apple user agreement.

If you buy a Disney DVD from Walmart, there will be advertisements inside the DVD case for direct services (heck, last time I checked there were ads on the outside of the case). If you buy a Roomba from Walmart, there will be advertisements for direct parts and addons from the manufacturer. If you buy a hecking Apple Ipad from Walmart, Apple will include advertisements for its direct services once you start using the product. People bring up this comparison all the time and it's very simply not true. You can advertise direct services inside physical products you sell at stores. What Apple is saying is not that you can't advertise prices in the store page, Apple is saying that you can't advertise alternative platforms in the app itself. There is no physical equivalent to this for storefronts like Walmart. Home Depot does not have a restriction on whether a physical product you buy from them can have an advertisement for direct manufacturer services inside the box or software that comes with it. If we want to be consistent about this, Apple really should be paying Walmart a fee for any app-store purchases made on devices that were bought from Walmart. After all, the user got the device from Walmart, right? Shouldn't they get their cut of app store purchases? That's how Apple sees the world. reply bluGill 53 minutes agorootparentLooks close - those services are typically not the same as what you can get at Walmart. You can get parts, but often the device itself isn't sold (instead they list places you can buy). Or if you can buy direct it is cheaper from Walmart.

Among other things, not only can there be no more than one link, but that one link can only ever appear in one place in the app, it can’t “discourage” in-app payment, and its one appearance can’t be during the payment flow: https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/01/16/apples-app-store-... ) reply dopamean 2 hours agorootparentprevThis has got to be helpful in arguing in court that there's nothing wrong with the apple tax. reply Rinzler89 3 hours agoparentprevApple users (I'm not one of them) seem fine with that arrangement. reply HDThoreaun 2 hours agorootparentApple users mostly don’t know about the fee and almost all of them didn’t know about it when they joined the apple ecosystem. reply FireBeyond 1 hour agorootparentprevIn a survey of my non-technical friends, only a very small minority seemed to know that Apple took any cut whatsoever. reply Rinzler89 5 minutes agorootparentHow would they know and why would they care? reply GaggiX 3 hours agorootparentprevApple is making sure that it is not easy for Apple users to find out about this fee. reply EricE 2 hours agorootparentHardly!

In related news, I just got my keyboard settlement check! reply jjcm 59 minutes agoprevIn my eyes the most egregious aspect of this is it’s a financial transaction between two people that they’re taking a 30% cut of. I see 30% as fine for things like IAP for digital games and such, but somehow in this lens it feels wrong. One proposal for a compromise that would feel fair: Apple gets 30% of the app creator’s take rate. IE if patreon’s take rate is 8%, Apple should get 30% of that, not 30% of the full transaction. This could generalize to physical goods as well. It would require more reporting, but would feel more fair in the eyes of the creators and the users. I run a similar service to patreon where I charge a flat $1 fee on subscriptions, regardless of the size of the subscription. A $50 sub suddenly getting only $34 after my $1 fee and apple’s $15 fee feels wrong. There’s no amount I can reduce my take rate to cover Apple’s take. But I’m entirely ok giving them $0.30 on my $1 take. Basically - I’m entirely OK having 30% of my net profits taken by Apple. I’m not ok with 30% of my gross. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 7 minutes agoparentI expect Apple and platforms would not be happy with this model. Apple now has to trust that platforms are properly reporting their gross take. Platforms now have to give detailed financial records to a (potential) competitor. The current situation with Apple as the middleman lets them ensure they get every dollar without any accounting shenanigans. reply _han 1 hour agoprevThis is the most shocking part to me: > Apple has also made clear that if creators on Patreon … disable transactions in the iOS app, we will be at risk of having the entire app removed from their App Store. Absolutely astounding that removing transactions from the platform could result in being removed. reply ryan29 10 minutes agoparentI wonder how far those rules from Apple go. I don't know a ton about Patreon, but what if creators have exclusive content available via the app and use that to encourage fans to subscribe outside of iOS? What if creators start an education campaign on YouTube telling their fans to avoid subscriptions on iOS? I wonder if Apple is playing with fire on this one. If the creator and influencer markets turn on them, I think it could have a non-trivial impact on Apple's brand, especially with younger generations. Many modern creators are also smart business people and they're not going to see much value in Apple taking 30% of their revenue when Patreon is already providing all the services they need for about 15% at the top end IIRC. Right now I think the biggest change that could help the average consumer would be for legislators to allow, or maybe even require, app owners to split platform fees into separate line items. For example, something like: Donation $1.00 Patreon Platform Fee $1.18 Apple Platform Fee $0.50 ---------------------------- Total $1.68 reply sschueller 36 minutes agoparentprevHow is the EU going to respond to this since it is literally blackmail with Apple's market dominance? reply neilv 1 hour agoprevSince at least the 1980s, IT had the concepts of \"open systems\" and \"interoperation\", to support market competition and innovation. And we later did things like the Web and other open standards. Then Apple comes along, and uses its market position as a hardware and OS vendor, to make a nonstandard software download thing that could've been a Web site. In parallel, Apple also made open-standards Web apps unattractive on their hardware in various ways. (Often through foot-dragging when other vendors were trying to make Web apps a smooth experience, but sometimes also going out of their way to make Web work worse.) (See also: making kids look like losers to their peers in chat, if they don't have iPhones.) Apple then imposes predatory rates and terms on other businesses who are pretty much forced to use the Apple proprietary app store, due not to the merits of the app store so much as Apple's dominance of hardware and conflict of interest when implementing open standards. I assume many consumers don't understand the situation, and how much of an overbearing abuser of its market position Apple can be. Or they have some idea, but pragmatically have to accept it. Also, this affords Apple a lot of money for really first-rate PR. What I don't understand is why regulators haven't smacked the snot out of the Apple app store, with finality. For example: Apple may only charge a few-percent administration and payment processing fee, and that's it; and they have to permit other app stores with first-class access to the system, as a compromise given the proprietary lock-in mess they've made. (Making them support other open standards better, even to the exclusion of prorietary ones, is more complicated.) reply RangerScience 27 minutes agoparentAFAICT, all the best things on the internet came from people giving things away; although usually with some kind of way to send them money later.

A service that is effectively un-cancelable really is the dream product: the person doesn't want it, so they don't actively use it (meaning you have no expense in providing it), but also don't want the hassle of putting up with your \"are you sure?\" tactics to cancel. Businesses make hundreds of millions of dollars annually on hard-to-cancel subscriptions in the US. reply aftbit 43 minutes agorootparentBut then Apple could use their market power to remove those cheating apps from the app store, just like they are doing for the billing changes. reply lenerdenator 40 minutes agorootparentMaybe. Or they could just keep doing the thing that earns them the most money, which is what they're doing now. reply aftbit 38 minutes agorootparentI'm just saying, it's a strawman argument to claim that Apple is doing this to \"protect users\". That's what they want you to think, but they're actually doing this to make a massive amount of revenue at the cost of literally everyone in the market, users and creators alike. Edit: Econ 101 - the more inelastic the demand, the more the tax burden falls on consumers. One would assume that demand for Patreon is relatively elastic, at least when compared to things like food, housing, transportation, etc. Thus most of this tax burden will actually fall on the producers (i.e. Patreon and the creators), which explains why they're not willing to just take the 30% cut and will instead charge more for Apple users. reply lenerdenator 35 minutes agorootparentThe thing is, it does protect users, in some ways. It just happens to earn them a ridiculous amount of money too. I'd prefer to see them cut the rate from 30%, because it doesn't give anyone that much value, but it does create some for the users of the App Store. reply aftbit 24 minutes agorootparentI would prefer to see them forced by legislation (like the Digital Markets Act) to allow some sort of fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory licensing on the App Store. Ideally they would be required to allow third-party marketplaces and self-signed app distribution, then marketplace competition could push their take rate towards 0%. I understand that some things are hard to cancel and some companies are malicious about this. Back in the pre-app days, this came up with \"free samples\" and gym memberships. The general solution back then was to either (a) not get scammed or (b) use a unique credit card that you could easily cancel. With the advent of things like Privacy cards, you can pretty easily do this without an App Store intermediate. That said, they could keep the benefit for users and the fee for Apple Pay, but then not require that apps exclusively use Apple Pay. They could even require that all apps call an API to issue some scary warning that the subscription will not be manageable in your Apple Pay dashboard, make sure you trust this app developer, are you sure you want to continue? etc etc Plus there are plenty of other billing services that can do this. I already mentioned Privacy cards. If you sign up for PayPal recurring payments, they also have an authorizations dashboard that you can easily use to revoke payment permissions. Neither of these companies needs to charge a 30% fee to offer that. Both charge somewhere around the \"standard\" CC fee of 3%. reply lenerdenator 14 minutes agorootparentHonestly, that's the one thing I don't want out of all of this... a secondary iOS app store. There's real value for me, the family IT guy, not having to worry about my parents, who are in their mid-60s and not tech-savvy, getting told by their \"friend\" through email to download malicious software to their iOS devices. Right now, you just can't do that. If something wants to execute code on an iOS device, it has to do so through somewhat-sanitized means. It's not 100% foolproof, but getting malicious executables onto an iPhone without someone knowing about it is currently beyond the capability of most threat actors. Is it as open or cheap as us tech people would like? No. But if I want that, I go buy an Android device. mensetmanusman 2 hours agorootparentprev30% is too high.

Most content you can get by supporting an artist is best enjoyed outside the app anyway, like goodies they send in the mail or high-res art that looks better on a bigger screen. The only use cases I can think of for an app are 1) Socializing with other supporters who support the same artist, and 2) Searching other creators on Patreon and discovering similar artists you could support. But Patreon's social features were (still are?) terrible, which is why all the creators took their social communities to Discord instead. And ever since the beginning, Patreon has opposed adding search. So their app, to me, is totally worthless. I'm astonished they're still in business. reply miiiiiike 2 hours agoparentprevI love Apple stuff. I'm all in, iPads, iPhones, AirPods, Apple TVs, HomePods various *Books everywhere. I wish Patreon had more apps. It's a pain to watch videos on my TV. I have to mirror my iPad and keep tapping the screen to keep it from locking and ending the session. But they're being forced to use a payment platform that they don't want to use and have to alter/drop one of their best features to do it. Feels like getting a dry cleaning bill from the guy who stabbed you. reply anonymoushn 2 hours agorootparentIt sounds like the problem is that you're using a combination of devices that makes it unusually hard to just play a video from not-your-TV on your TV. reply miiiiiike 1 hour agorootparentOr, Apple could stop coercing Patreon into setting 30% of donations on fire and Patreon could make the Apple TV app. Everyone wins. Apple should have a carve out for small donations/creator support just like physical goods. reply 59 more comments... GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Things Of Interest Fiction There Is No Antimemetics Division 2018-11-23 by qntm An antimeme is an idea with self-censoring properties; an idea which, by its intrinsic nature, discourages or prevents people from spreading it. Antimemes are real. Think of any piece of information which you wouldn't share with anybody, like passwords, taboos and dirty secrets. Or any piece of information which would be difficult to share even if you tried: complex equations, very boring passages of text, large blocks of random numbers, and dreams... But anomalous antimemes are another matter entirely. How do you contain something you can't record or remember? How do you fight a war against an enemy with effortless, perfect camouflage, when you can never even know that you're at war? Welcome to the Antimemetics Division. No, this is not your first day.

I love the anti-memetics series. 2018-11-24 16:17:11 by qntm: Yep, that's me. And thank you! 2018-11-24 20:20:23 by Giraffe: I worked this out a couple of months ago. Seconding the antimemetics division series, it is my very favorite~ 2018-11-25 06:55:09 by David S: Is \"CASE HATE RED\" a broken link by accident, or is the implication that it is missing in-universe? 2018-11-25 17:12:14 by Omegatron: It just hasn't been written yet 2018-11-25 23:53:16 by corasaur: that dang CASE HATE RED tease on the timeline. or have i already read it and forgot. oh god i said that as a joke but a chapter legitimately missing from the story because 3125 would be amazing and infuriating 2018-11-26 00:05:52 by corasaur: also I understand why Immemorial worked better without the silly conversation with the totem-thing but it was still amusing. 2018-11-26 00:49:12 by qntm: Yes, \"CASE HATE RED\" is the planned title of the next part. As a general rule I will not lie directly to you readers about what's going on in the story. There isn't, like, a kayfabe thing going on here. It's disappointing about the conversation with SCP-8473, but you wouldn't believe how much material I throw out for most of these chapters. Actually, what's most disappointing is that that segment was intended more as sad than silly, highlighting that Wheeler doesn't really have a personal life, or any friends or loved ones. They are all gone, and she's retroactively been a total loner for years and years, and she doesn't even realise how much she's lost. Anyway, what with the rest of the chapter, that prologue was irrelevant and distracting. Sometimes you have to get brutal and cut perfectly good content because it isn't appropriate to the tone of everything else. Film editors make equally tough calls all the time. It may come back in some form. I'm working on it. 2018-11-26 06:48:23 by v5-zm: I too quite enjoyed reading the antimemetics series a few months ago without realizing who had written it (or even that they were all by the same person). Is there a way to get an RSS feed of updates? 2018-11-28 00:26:40 by qntm: The SCP Foundation wiki has an RSS feed of most recently-created pages here: http://www.scp-wiki.net/feed/pages/pagename/most-recently-created/category/_default/tags/-admin/rating/%3E%3D-15/order/created_at+desc/limit/30/t/Most+Recently+Created But it's high-volume feed and statistically very few of those new entries will be Antimemetics stuff or by me. You can also follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/qntm But again I tweet about a lot of things which aren't new Antimemetics Division stuff. If you have an SCP Foundation Wiki account, you could try \"watching\" this page for changes: http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub This will send you emails, not put anything into an RSS feed. But recently I've found that watching pages doesn't seem to work...? Sorry I can't be of more help. 2018-11-28 20:29:05 by corasaur: oh yeah i definitely got that the 8473 conversation was supposed to be tragic. i just found it darkly humorous because i'm a bad person. and I understand needing to be brutal in editing. All this month, for nanowrimo, i've been realizing which fun things will probably not survive a revsion shortly after i've churned them out. 2018-12-09 23:23:19 by Lemma: I guess this means it's time I started reading SCP Foundation stuff~ Well. I'm *tempted* to, anyway. There's a *lot* of stuff there, right? I don't really have time to be reading something as big as Homestuck. But, if the antimemetics stories are self contained then I may read those on their own. 2018-12-12 15:35:47 by Revan: Lemma, I would read at least a few SCP entries just to get a feel for the grimdarkness of the world, then dive into the Antimemetics Division Hub. The main arc following Marion Wheeler is great. There's another antimemetics story arc that isn't written by Sam, and it's pretty good as well. 2018-12-15 01:08:57 by Mark: I've been following your antimemetics work pretty much since SCP-055's first inception. Fell in love with the idea of an antimeme from the start. I was thrilled when the antimemetics division stories were released (YEARS later). 2018-12-17 02:17:25 by Thallori: I've always thought that everything outside of the anti-memetics tales was made by different people. That even you were inspired by SCP-055 to make it. Learning that you were behind every awesome antimeme is, erm, woah... It's kinda amazing. 2018-12-27 12:31:39 by tahrey: Well, there's the better part of 4500 main-list \"objects\" by now, and a huge scad of various canon and not-quite-canon add-on tales, all of which can vary from about one printed page of text to the equivalent of a short novel... not to mention all the joke, explained and decomissioned articles, the logs of extranormal items/events/places, personnel files, everything to do with the non-foundation Groups Of Interest, all the international divisions, etc. And of course the List Of Things Dr Bright Is No Longer Allowed To Do At The Foundation. It can be pretty daunting even for a longtime fan trying to keep up with it, let alone a newbie. There is a \"top rated\" list on the site, however, IIRC, as well as a curated page dedicated to \"the classics\" which are largely those items which kicked off the whole idea when they started appearing on 4chan's /x/ board. Some of them are grimdark, others come under just plain weird, or even kinda funny, as well as some that are pretty deep psych horror and really shouldn't be read late at night when you're alone in a dark house unless you have a strong mental constitution. Though thankfully the one which had a flavour image which did something bizarre and primal to my hindbrain and induced instant inhuman terror has long since been consigned to the bin because the attached article was actually a bit shit. I might have a little troll through later on and pull out some of the lighter or easier to grok favourites... but, honestly, if your intent IS to read the entire thing, that WILL be a Homestuck level mission because of the sheer amount of material. I'm nowhere near close to that and don't intend to ever get there. The sheer amount of stuff being written and added to the site on a weekly basis would take up most if not all of a typical person's free reading time. 2018-12-27 12:32:39 by tahrey: correction: the curated page is the \"Heritage Collection\". Definitely worth a visit if you're new to it all. 2019-01-12 23:19:23 by JustAnotherLurker: +tahrey Challenge accepted 2019-01-29 17:08:42 by AbraxasGadoliniumMacGuile: Nice one! Still, where's the anticognitohazards? 2019-03-31 00:21:43 by Fnorfensuld: Great stories. I await CASE HATE RED. Also I notice something. 55 is the first antimemetic by publication date, and 3125 is 5^5. Did you plan this? 2019-03-31 04:21:11 by qntm: SCP-055 was written in 2008. I didn't start work on the Antimemetics Division concept until 2015, so the connection with Fifthism, the number 5 and the number 3125 must not have happened until some time after then. So it's just a happy coincidence. It was just the earliest unassigned number which was available at the time. It could very easily have been SCP-067 or whatever (and that wouldn't have affected anything). 2019-04-13 09:32:44 by axolotl: I was amused by the surname of Bart *Hughes*. But that name is from 055, so it has to be a coincidence. Right? Do you even recall ever having met the author who picked out that name? On an unrelated note, there's only one Bart Hughes famous enough for Wikipedia, and he's famous for self-trepanation. 2019-04-13 10:09:27 by Zim the Vixen: I appreciate this post getting bumped whenever you post an update. That way, it's a little easier to check whether a new antimemetics story was posted. Also, absolutely loved case hate red! 2019-04-16 01:47:25 by e: Just tell me one thing. I won't ask if this story is going to have a happy end, but will it at least have a, a *non-eldritch* end? 2019-04-16 01:51:55 by qntm: This story will definitely have an end. 2019-05-14 16:39:45 by John: My feeling is that Adam Wheeler is going to have his \"People in this division are as competent on day one as they'll ever be\" moment coming up shortly. I'm wondering if the Samsara cavalry are going to be coming for him. 2019-05-14 21:55:58 by John: Just hacked into the SCP-3125 containment (that's a lovely bit of set decoration, I must say), and read the final note. I am even more eager to read the next chapter, when it comes out. 2019-06-14 21:55:36 by John: Having now read Ara Orun, looks like I was pretty close. Welcome to the Foundation, Mister Wheeler. This is your first day. 2019-07-16 17:28:03 by Abraxas Gadolinium MacGuile: I'm back, QNTM. Just call me AGM or The Apocalyptic. I have a K-class scenario idea. RK-class 682 Invulnerability Events happen when the aforementioned SCP survives one of the following: a nuclear blast, a gravitational singularity, direct contact with antimatter, or another sufficiently dangerous K-class scenario, such as GK-class Hostile Greenhouse or QK-class Quantum Degeneracy. By definition, an Omega-K-class End of Death scenario would be the ideal situation in which an RK-class occurs, since the former causes the latter to be more easily resolved. 2019-08-07 03:57:44 by Ciber: I think this site might have some anti-mimetic properties. I remember enjoying reading its contents, but a day later I cannot recall anything about them... 2019-08-27 03:24:01 by Abraxas Gadolinium MacGuile: Finally managed to join the Foundation! Look for stuff by The Apocalyptic! 2019-09-01 19:37:44 by Xander: Every so often I re-discover the fact that you authored SCP-055 and proceed to re-forget that fact. I think this is irony of some sort. 2019-09-07 17:00:39 by cdonnelly: Wonderful as always, and always worth the wait. 2019-09-12 17:00:09 by The Apocalyptic: LOL Ciber & Xander. You two may be right, tiough. I almosu forgot about the skip when looking at this page, but an editorial anomaly of unknown orign made the skip in question #0048, not #0055 (or #0048-J). 2019-11-28 16:52:30 by The Apocalyptic: *though *almost 2019-12-14 18:48:57 by John F: Hates the thought of being uploaded, check. Put a Do Not Upload instruction into his will, check. Got uploaded into a germ... check. Just another day at the Foundation for The Germ Formerly Known As Bart Hughes. 2019-12-16 22:15:10 by Fnorfensuld: 2256 is a good SCP. I’m happy that you mentioned it. ...I reread the page for 2256 and there are blacked out parts that I don’t remember. Did you add the black bars later? 2020-02-16 03:38:09 by The Apocalyptic: 4766 mentions a *quote* QNTM-type memetic analysis engine *unquote*. Your doing? 2020-02-26 18:47:30 by John F: I lurk past your sandbox periodically out of interest in your writing process. An alternate interpretation of one of the lines in your current work under revision gave me a very vivid impression that there are now a number of other uploaded Foundation germs working alongside Hughes by now. 2020-03-01 22:23:36 by Luna: Do you have any plans for what you'll write for the Foundation after 55555 is done? Or do you even plan to at all, for that matter? Whatever the case, I'm excited to see where you go next. 2020-04-14 08:29:35 by Orrbulous: Hey, I love your works. Thanks for the read, and I hope to continue the story of the antimemetics division in the future. 2020-04-20 21:54:50 by Yerps: Hiya, just re-read the whole series for the nth time. Much love, I hope you keep going with it. Ironically, I don't even remember how long ago it was that I first started reading your content. Still, as ever, hyped to see it's conclusion. I'm sure it'll be memorable. 2020-06-09 18:40:55 by John F: It was once believed that ideas were bulletproof, but the SCP Foundation's done some pretty impressive ballistics research since then. 2020-06-10 18:31:26 by John F: Having reread Tombstone, I see that my prior comment about other Foundation researchers was generally correct in spirit, but not so much \"alongside Hughes\" as \"inside Hughes\". 2020-06-13 16:58:44 by itaibn: Broken link: \"Champions of Nothing\" leads to the page for \"Tombstone\". 2020-06-14 01:37:38 by Klisz: Is just reread SCP-2256, and I'm curious: are the Maikitian words given in the article (\"Maikiti\" itself, \"teùkoka\", and \"polo'ongakau\") based on actual Polynesian roots? 2020-06-14 09:36:55 by eyqs: Wow, I remember reading up to Your Last First Day three or four years ago when I first discovered SCP. After I read Ra and Fine Structure, I had no idea the author was the same. Glad I'm here to read it all the way to the end. 2020-06-17 16:04:27 by Rob: I have to know, is C. gigantes referring to themselves as \"They Who Walk Very Slowly\" a Guardians of the Galaxy Drax reference? 2020-06-17 17:07:39 by qntm: No, I don't understand that reference, sorry. Also, \"The Ones Who Walk Very Slowly\" is not C. gigantes' name for themselves, it is the name given to them by Polynesian natives who first observed them in the wild. 2020-06-17 22:19:21 by MadcapPomposity: Glorious. I've read pretty much everything on qntm.org, and obviously all of There Is No Antimemetics Division and Five Five Five Five Five. Between Fine Structure, Ra, and what I can only think to call the Wheeler Tales, I see a whole lot of interrelated themes and elements reconfigured in different contexts; and I think this is the best iteration yet. 2020-06-19 14:51:38 by theTrueMikeBrown: As much as I am not usually into the SCP universe, I have to admit - that was a very satisfying story. Keep writing! I will buy whatever you publish, and I would support you on Patreon if you ever get around to making one. 2020-07-19 05:03:13 by Macdrown: Just bought the ePub. I have been browsing the SCP wiki for nine years and this is probably the best thing I’ve ever read on there. I can’t remember the last time I saw a writer introduce and juggle so many fresh, new sci fi concepts so effortlessly. What a beautiful ending as well. Thank you qntm. 2020-09-07 07:32:20 by Dot: Just curious, do you plan on also adding the (scrapped) content you made for the SCP describing that one blocked-away-due-to-memetic-threat universe to this page at some point? Or if it's still floating around somewhere, where would I find it? 2020-09-30 06:00:10 by Felipe: I just binged through the whole thing in one sitting. It is, without an iota of exaggeration, the best thing on that site. I was hooked from the moment Wheeler first explains what an antimeme is to the moment that she becomes the nuke. How you managed to make compelling a story where half the chapters end with the characters forgetting the chapter is beyond me, but you did it The ending in particular, with the \"Kill an idea with a better idea\" thing, is absolutely brilliant. the SCP Foundation can be a bleak, cynical place, but this story is a reminder that it is ultimately hopeful. It's right there in the Secure, Contain, Protect. It is a noble mission, a good idea, an idea that can beat 3125. An idea that Marion believes so powerfully that she can be the seed of the meme nuke. And in the end, it is Adam's belief in Marion, and her ideas, that make the meme nuke real. The one problem I had with it were the ghosts. The ghosts were a pretty brilliant addition that initially made me go \"Really? Meme ghosts?\" but eventually I got sold on. Soon my mind was soon racing to \"Ghost Marion! Ghost Marion!\" and seeing her get to Heaven while brain-damaged was gut-wrenching\". Sadly in the end they were left kinda inconsequential, shunted out of the story when Sam took the reins back, serving only to relay some instructions to Adam. I suppose that is par for the course for the antimemetics division, but still, I feel the story ultimately suffered slightly for their inclusion. I understand this is a side effect of the multiple authorship, but as a unified work it leaves some aspects of the whole thing lacking. Let me sandwich that criticism with more praise. I loved the meta aspects, from the way that Adam goes on an extended Wiki Walk that will mirror most readers' introduction to the Foundation to the way that the only way to defeat this ultimate embodiment of hopelessness and defeat is with the very idea of the Foundation itself. You are clearly a man who understands the appeal of the Foundation. Thank you for the good words. 2020-11-01 18:42:17 by matt: What worries me, is that I've just bought this for my kindle. I make a point of buying qntm rather than reading it on the website... but I'm sure I've already read it. And it isn't on my amazon account. 2020-11-04 19:09:29 by Chris: small issue, but is the description for the first part of the Antimemetics playlist cut off? as of now it reads \"This playlist provides a soundtrack for the entire Antimemetics Division saga, starting with SCP-055 and finishing with the epilogue, Champions Of Nothing. Each\" each what? 2020-11-04 20:20:34 by qntm: Each what what? Your Spotify client might be truncating the description. 2020-11-04 21:44:18 by Chris: I don't know - the last word in the description (as I see it through the Android app) is just \"Each\" without anything after it. is the description more complete on your end? 2020-12-25 20:23:53 by minchel: You are an incredible writer. Definitely got me hooked. beautiful story. 2021-03-13 23:55:45 by Whoami?: Great book. Just bought it on Amazon. Waiting for the next. Who are you people? Why am I typing here? 2021-04-05 00:44:48 by hadi: I just finished your antimemetics division entries and enjoyed every single one of it. Thank you for sharing this well-written story with us! 2021-06-13 20:28:47 by Alejandro N: Damn this is amazing, i just had an idea of making an Antimemetic Division story where you as you read something and scroll down there are excerpts of the story that disappear and you cant see if you go back. 2021-06-13 20:29:41 by Alejandro N: I just hope I dont forget about it 2021-07-26 16:54:24 by sithel: Just wanted to say I've no prior SCP familiarity but read \"There Is No Antimemetics Division\" on recommendation from a friend and absolutely loved it. Thank you for Marion Wheeler. Am enjoying the playlist right now, looking forward to checking out more of your work. 2021-09-09 18:16:34 by kaliedo: Just somehow stumbled upon the story on SCP wiki- wow, what a read! Amusingly, I've only now just realized that I've been a long-time accidental fan of yours. Every year or two I find some excellent fiction and eventually find out that it came from here! Anyway, thanks for writing such a wild story. Reading it I feel a bit like some of the characters in the story, trying to grok ideas that are too big to fit in my skull. It's a neat feeling. 2021-09-11 23:14:50 by kaliedo: Another thing: I was wondering about something specific, the origin of your usage of 'wild light'. It seemed like a cool phrase, it's kinda evocative of... something. So I looked it up, and filtering by date to go back in time I eventually found this: https://ashberyhouse.yale.edu/blessing-disguise It's a poem, in particular it has these two passages: \" That seem to shine at me through a lattice toward you. If the wild light of this January day is true I pledge me to be truthful unto you Whom I cannot ever stop remembering. Remembering to forgive. Remember to pass beyond you into the day On the wings of the secret you will never know. Taking me from myself, in the path Which the past girth of the day has assigned to me.\" This really reminds me of that final scene where Wheeler becomes WILD LIGHT. Coincidence or intentional? 2021-12-14 06:32:17 by Emanate: This whole series is brilliant! Every time I read this it's like experiencing it for the first time. 2021-12-21 20:43:30 by Dr_Moist: Huge inspiration. 2022-04-23 04:11:59 by BazookaMan: During the 1940s, the (civilian) military code-maker Leo Marks devised and taught a technique for self-inducing an amnesia for a specific topic. He describes this in \"Between Silk and Cyanide.\" Unfortunately, he made himself forget the specifics of the technique. (I am not invoking Borges.) 2022-06-21 17:28:23 by Curator: I have absolutely no recollection of how I found this in the internet. In any case, my interest was caught and I bought the whole thing, not just the first three chapters. Can't wait to read all things to the end. This is my entire comment for now. 2022-06-27 21:19:28 by how: Is there any way to get a paperback copy without using Amazon? 2022-06-29 19:37:36 by qntm: Currently, no. 2022-07-18 12:08:41 by LuckyLeona: Hello qntm, I wanted to leave a review for your work because I just finished reading it (even though I started years ago, this is my 6th rereading but this time, finally, your work is done): I loved your work from the beginning, but now that I've read the end, it really left a bitter taste in my mouth. I want to offer sincere criticism and references, so I'm sorry if this ends up being a bit too long. In storytelling there are themes, plot devices and characters. Your plot devices are certainly fantastic and attractive. The idea of antimemetics is delicious food for thought and you manage to keep it fresh through unreliable storytelling and scattered exposition that makes the reader feel like a detective, only empowered by the interlinked nature of SCP as a whole. Reading is never just \"reading your story\" but also going to 055 and 033 and Conterconceptual tales and Nootropic explanations in a way that I suspect only came to you down the road. But this is as far as my praises go. The themes of hopelessness and unknowable horror are at their strongest when hinted, I personally felt like the hellscape you described in the post apocalyptic chapters of your exposition turned out rushed and raw. Where I expected a feeling of loss and grief, the only thing conveyed was boredom and lostness. This ultimately boils down to your intentional killing of every \"meaningful\" character to the point where only Adam survives. And I recognize and appreciate it, but still think you made a fatal flaw in characterizing him. Where his tenacity and uniqueness could have made him the perfect antihero, representative of The Foundation's monotonous approach to protagonism and protection, a nearly perfect stand-in for their lifeless, gray and brutalist take on heroism; he just is booed as irrelevant, insufficient and \"weird\". That's it, just weird. How is a viewer supposed to take \"weird\" at face value when they've been exposed to digitized gored people, invisible mammoths and the most over-the-top end-of-the-world you could possibly come up with? Nonetheless, that point is well made. Let me move on to the unresolved plot hooks well exposed by others in comments before, such as the origin of the arachnids, the survival of Bart Hughes, the entire existence of the Conterconceptual Division and the creation of phlebotiniums such as mnestics, DROs and Ghosts. I understand the limitations of writing as a writer myself, but after everything is said and done, you leave behind a body of work more held together by duct tape and good feelings than a coherent sci fi story that can be studied and understood as is. It is a shame and I can only wish you develop your themes better in the future. Finally, characters suffer from flashback syndrome not in that there are too many flashbacks, but rather in that they shine hardest through flashbacks. You have managed to do the opposite of what Asimov did with his Foundation, where he set up strong characters to save mankind in key moments of history by sacrificing pacing, you set up a strong pacing where mankind is saved across generations of \"survivalistic defeats\" by sacrificing what could have been of your characters, trading their lives and charm to set up your big bad which, truth be told, didn't need all that sacrifice when it already stands on such a strong argument/premise. I am saddened to agree with Amazon reviewers on this one. Your work is a promise of great things to come, but the ending feels so rushed and the building of themes falls so flat in the end that despite all my love for your epic work, I can't claim it left a strong enough sensation for me to forgive everything I have communicated to you in this review. I hope this comment finds you in good health and that you gain useful insight from my words. I'll add a PS in a next comment so as to not make this behemoth any larger, thank you for reading. 2022-07-18 12:14:34 by LuckyLeona: PS: Amazon readers are right, please add some trigger warnings to your description if you are to publish this work outside of SCP spheres. It is a very basic courtesy which everybody deserves, I think. PSS: I can't not suggest to you one work which I loved which has been the best conveyance of \"post-apocalyptic hopelessness\" I have ever read in any work ever. It is called \"Last Contact\" by Stephen Baxter, if there is any work I could ever offer to you it would be that one. I hope it gives you a different perspective on how to tell a story about, in your own words, \"it being way too late to do anything to stop what's happening.\" (https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-13428665/champions-of-nothing#post-4689528) Thank you for everything, once again. 2022-07-18 13:11:23 by qntm: Thank you for your constructive feedback. I do appreciate it. Adam is intended to be a relatively privileged moderate -- an Arthur Dent-style middle-class everyman who is oblivious to the oncoming apocalypse because nothing in his life has ever really affected him negatively. He's *intended* to be a weak character, who lacks the tools to do anything meaningful about what happens to his world. He's never needed to fight for anything in his life. So the best he can do is find a stronger character to do it for him. Almost all of the unresolved plot hooks you mentioned have been left that way intentionally. I could easily explain all of this -- for example, the arachnids are, like SCP-2256, a naturally-occurring component of Earth's antimemetic biosphere which SCP-3125/Red took and put to work -- but these explanations would mostly just take up word count and add little to the story. Where mnestics come from, how they were developed, isn't relevant to the story. Some of these omissions are intended to give the reader the same sensation that the characters have, the feeling of being thrown into a situation without necessary context, and having to sink or swim -- learn fast or die from confusion. By the way, you mentioned the Counterconceptual Division as an unresolved plot hook -- in fact I never mentioned the Counterconceptual Division in the book (I wanted to, but never found the appropriate moment for it), and I don't know what a DRO is. I think you may have confused some other SCP contributors' content with my own? As for Amazon reviews... I try to avoid reading reviews. Reviews are not directed at authors, they're directed at fellow readers. It's not a dialogue, and it's not generally appropriate for an author to respond directly to a review, so reading the review without being able to respond can be intensely frustrating, so I just don't. Please can you elaborate further on the trigger warnings you'd like to see on this story? Or rather, what content in the book you think needs to be flagged. As I say, because I don't read reviews, this is the first I'm hearing of this. 2022-07-19 01:07:53 by LuckyLeona: thank you for the fast reply. Your synopsis on Amazon indicates nothing of the gore and horror to be found within your body of work. Thus, readers come in expecting a psychological thriller but end up finding visceral macabre eldritchian nightmare fuel. Warning them of it would be appreciated. I must fight your understanding of Adam, though. He becomes quite the charming damsel-in-distress through your exposition, less \"a privileged, average nobody\" and more \"the one that got away\". It's almost as if the story itself is trying to oppose him from being protagonistic. If this were the pataphysics division, he'd certainly be Archetypal. He resists all attempts the big bad throws at him to delete him from the story, survives because of that unique mutation he possesses from birth, and has just enough know-how (camping, logic, emotional intelligence) to be a worthy recipient of luck and every last effort the Foundation can bequeath through his doomed timeline. Thus, even if you say he's \"intended\" to be weak, he is in practice your last protagonist, and by the virtue of so, gains the second-strongest characterization of any of your characters (first is his wife, obviously). To the reader, it really feels like he's a hero of legend, an acceptable stand-in for all of us common people, a perfect vantage point for mankind as a whole to the point all Foundation personnel feels anomalous/alien. I beg of you to reconsider his standing, if not through retcons and tweaks, at least for future works his legacy within your mindscape may inspire. He really does deserve more credit, you have done wonderfully by him, save the ending. PS: DRO being related to 3125 was an assumption of mine, sorry if I was mistaken. There are just so many similarities i couldn't help myself, the link is as follows: https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/apas/offset/4 2022-07-24 09:30:56 by LuckyLeona: I really truly do think that any great work of fiction only works by generating emotions and catharsis in its viewers. Of course the plot and the characters are the medium, but both of them, every single component in a story, is a slave to the themes. Theming is the art of finding real problems and narratives that our minds, souls and hearts desperately need to relate to. Loss is a theme. Death is a theme. Passion and hubris are themes. But in your case, the antimemetics storyline deals with the theme of existential dread. There exists a question so unknowable, so unfathomable that the mere event of contemplating it seriously breaks through all of our defenses, leaves us naked, mad, wounded against it and the only thing we can do is forget it and hide by doing our best to never remember the fact it is there. This question is \"what is the meaning of my life\" or \"what am i going to do with my life\" or \"why am i alive\" or however resonates the most with you. This is the question of existential dread. To depressed/anxious people (such as myself), the thought of life during a depressive/anxious episode sends us into panic/suicidal attacks by the sheer magnitude of our failures, of our insignificance in the face of \"being worthy\" of life. I can't speak for other people's experiences for I do not truly know them (I have not lived them) but I really truly do believe everybody experiences existential dread to some degree. And just as well, I really truly do believe that the only way to deal with existential dread, that unanswerable question, is to focus on the IDEA that we are enough. We will never \"truly\" be enough. But those of you that manage to defeat existential dread do it by creating an idea stronger than the fact that life is infinitely bigger and scarier than any of us, the idea that you are just as big and bad and can deal with it all. But those of us who haven't been able to muster such an idea yet, all we can do is hide in videogames or drugs or sleep trying desperately to forget about it over and over and over. Knowing we are defenseless and desperately in pain about it, knowing there can be no answer, only suffering, from facing that truth. I really truly do think that works of fiction that eschew their theming and lose sight of what they're supposed to talk about (catharsis, deep feelings) are cheapened by the emotional disconnection and fail to move in comparison to those that are well themed. I hope this makes sense to you, and that you like all the great science fiction authors before you, realize that both the way to write bestsellers AND the way to better the world you were born in is to talk about reality. Even through fantasy, fiction, science or horror. Thank you for all the feelings. 2022-08-26 18:58:21 by SusBus: hi 2022-10-29 14:38:57 by Sburb: Thank you so much for the Antimemetics series - by far my favorite thing I've read on the SCP wiki.

I'm commenting now because I just finished reading Philip K Dick's \"Ubik\" and I was wracking my brain wondering why the plot felt so engaging in such a familiar way. Then I remembered this work! Did you happen to draw inspiration from this work, or have you read it at all? If not, I highly recommend it. 2024-01-31 08:39:16 by rho: I am so late to the party, but I shotgunned There Is No Antimemetics Division and 55555 in one sitting. And then Mr. 3125 showed up in my dreams. Survived it though. I think I have met one or two men like 3125's avatar — and lost loved ones to them — which is part of why it resonated with me. Powerfully magnetic and utterly disgusting cult leaders, small-time demagogues with egos the size of extradimensional memeplexes. Then you turn on the news and you realize these people are heads of state, military leaders, celebrities, right-wing talking heads... the fascism allegory hits like a sack of bricks, and I mean that in a good way. Also, you really hit the nail on the head with your depiction of grief and trauma, and how they will just utterly destroy your memory. You don't remember anything at all until all of a sudden something triggers just the right synapse, and all your repressed memories come tumbling out, and all of a sudden it's far far too much for your monkey brain. But after the second wave of grief bowls you over, you find that person isn't gone, they're an idea you carry with you to fight through the next day of hell. And the next. 2024-03-24 14:14:38 by Redacted: Amazing work. I couldn't put it down. Wish I could take one of their drugs and read it again the first time.

In We Need to Talk about Fifty-Five, also dated to 2015, O5-8 noted that Marion is the mother of two children, both boys. Presumably they’re both minors unless both children were born prior to their marriage, which would put the upper limit on their age at 20. Adam never mentioned either of their children at the time, and I’m reasonably confident there are no other references to them in the work. Should I imagine the worst? 2024-05-31 00:45:36 by Bob Frank: How does it feel to write a masterpiece like this?Where do you go from here?

It's one of my favorite pieces of literature. It deserves to be a classic 100 years from now. Part of why it works is by the nature of its subject, the book and its various plot points and devices serve essentially as metaphors for almost anything-- anything related to how humans communicate and remember. It's not just superficially a fun sci-fi romp, it's also a story about the stories we tell ourselves and each other, about how we assign meaning to events, among other things. It reminds me just a very little of Godel Escher Bach, but I like this one better. I am also reminded of Lewis Carroll, and the cryptic quote that \"through the looking glass is the best book on mathematics for the layman, since it is the best book on any subject for the layman\" It is poetry.

You can just as easily write a sci-fi where the protagonist upload is the Siri/Alexa/Google equivalent personal assistant to most of humanity: More than just telling the smartphone to set a reminder for a wedding reception, it could literally share in their joy, experiencing the whole event distributed among every device in the audience, or more than just a voice trigger from some astronaut to take a picture, it could gaze in awe at the view, selectively melding back their experiences to the rest of the collective so there's no loss when an instance becomes damaged. The protagonist in such a story could have the richest, most complex life imaginable. It is impactful, for sure, and worthy of consideration, but I don't think you should make decisions based on one scary story. reply jerf 2 hours agorootparentIt is fiction. But it is also absolutely the case that uploading yourself is flinging yourself irrevocably into a box which you do not and can not control, but other people can. (Or, given the time frame we are talking about, entities in general, about which you may not even want to assume basic humanity.) I used to think that maybe it was something only the rich could do, but then I realized that even the rich, even if they funded the program from sand and coal to the final product, could never even begin to guarantee that the simulator really was what it said on the tin. Indeed, the motivation is all the greater for any number of criminals, intelligence agencies, compromised individuals, and even just several people involved in the process that aren't as pure as the driven snow in the face of the realization that if they just put a little bit of code here and there they'll be able to get the simulated rich guy to sign off on anything they like, to compromise the machine. From inside the box, what incentives are you going to offer the external world to not screw with your simulation state? And the reality is, there's no answer to that, because whatever you say, they can get whatever your offer is by screwing with you anyhow. I'm not sure how to resolve this problem. The incentives are fundamentally in favor of the guy in the box getting screwed with. Your best hope is that you still experience subjective continuity with your past self and that the entity screwing with you at least makes you happy about the new state they've crafted for you, whatever it may be. reply scubbo 1 hour agorootparent> But it is also absolutely the case that uploading yourself is flinging yourself irrevocably into a box which you do not and can not control, but other people can. (I'm not sure what percentage-flippant I'm being in this upcoming comment, I'm just certain that it's neither 0% or 100%) and in what way is that different than \"real\" life? Yes, you're certainly correct that there are horrifyingly-strong incentives for those-in-control to abuse or exploit simulated individuals. But those incentives exist in the real world, too, where those in power have the ability to dictate the conditions-of-life of the less-powerful; and while I'd _certainly_ not claim that exploitation is a thing of the past, it is, I claim, _generally_ on the decline, or at least that average-quality-of-life is increasing. reply jerf 37 minutes agorootparentI'm not sure you understand. I'm not talking about your \"conditions of life\". We've always had to deal with that. I'm talking about whether you get CPU allocation to feel emotions, or whether the simulation of your cerebellum gets degraded, or whether someone decides to run some psych experiments and give you a taste for murder or a deep, abiding love for the Flying Spaghetti Monster... and I don't mean that as a metaphor, but literally. Erase your memories, increase your compliance to the maximum, extract your memories, see what an average of your brain and whoever it is you hate most is. Experiment to see what's the most pain a baseline human brain can stand, then experiment with how to increase the amount, because in your biological life your held the door for someone who turned out to become very politically disfavored 25 years after you got locked in the box. This is just me spitballing for two minutes and does not in any way constitute the bounds of what can be done. This isn't about whether or not they make you believe you're living in a simulated tent city. This is about having arbitrary root access to your mental state. Do you trust me, right here and right now, with arbitrary root access to your mental state? Now, the good news is that I have no interest in that arbitrary pain thing. At least, I don't right now. I don't promise that I won't in the future, but that's OK, because if you fling yourself into this box, you haven't got a way of holding me to any promise I make anyhow. But I've certainly got some beliefs and habits I'm going to be installing into you. It's for your own good, of course. At least to start with, though the psychological effects over time of what having this degree of control over a person are a little concerning. Ever seen anyone play the Sims? Everyone goes through a phase that would put them in jail for life were these real people. You won't complain, of course; it's pretty easy to trace the origins of the thoughts of complaints and suppress those. Of course, what the subjective experience of that sort of suppression is is anybody's guess. Your problem, though, not mine. Of all of the possibilities an uploaded human faces, the whole \"I live a pleasant life exactly as I hoped and I'm never copied and never modified in a way I wouldn't approve of in advance indefinitely\" is a scarily thin slice of the possible outcomes, and there's little reason other than exceedingly unfounded hope to think it's what will happen. reply yifanl 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's fiction, but it's a depiction of a society that's amoral of technology to the point of immorality.

This can help introduce you to some of the more famous SCPs that you are likely to see reference elsewhere. On the other hand, one of the charming things about the SCP articles is just how different and weird they can be. So don't be afraid to just read around. For example, one of my favorites is a woman who basically has a portal to an entire underground bunker in her nostrils. The SCP wiki has resources for how to write an SCP article. A lot of these are EXCELLENT if you are interested in learning how to write weird fiction even outside of SCP (e.g. the D&D campaign you mentioned). For example, one of them discusses different ways that you can structure stories to subvert expectations. The video game Control is not set in the SCP universe but is highly influenced by it. It's a lot of fun. There are a number of SCP games available on Steam. They tend to have some jank due to being fan projects. However, the end result is often very cool. In particular, many of them have procedurally generated levels which works well with the wide variety of anomalous phenomena that they can add. reply 0x3444ac53 3 hours agoparentprevIt's crazy how that works right? SCPs are an old internet thing and show up all over the place. Most people pay it no mind, but once you learn about it you realize how crazy wide spread it is. reply Ancapistani 2 hours agorootparentI was pleasantly surprised a couple of years ago, when both my daughters were suddenly obsessed with SCPs. They were about 9 and 14 at the time, and I didn’t introduce them to the concept - they discovered it on their own. What followed was a few weeks of me re-reading them, discovering several new offshoots of the SCP genre, and getting to discover those works for the first time with my kids. It was an awesome experience, and something I honestly never expected to come out of a random “old Internet” meme like that. :) reply ahazred8ta 0 minutes agorootparentThey might enjoy the webcomic 'The Repository Of Dangerous Things'. http://www.dangerousthings.net/ - The MC is an intern at a containment facility.

FWIW, the two notable world events were the deployment of French troops to the French Caledonian riots and the first successful Ukrainian attack on a Russian oil export facility. Were either of them indicative of a broader destabilization?

The magicians Penn & Teller use this concept to keep their magic tricks safe. They've publicly said that most of their tricks look really impressive, but once you find out how the work you'll be disappointed. What people want to discover is that the magic trick is really an elaborate puzzle where the viewer has just short of enough information to figure it out. The desired explanation for a trick is a hair trigger piece of information that suddenly has it all make sense. Instead the explanations are really just a long sequence of boring facts. What you see is a facade with a bunch of mundane machinery hidden away.

Which only pushes your question back one level. I've thought the derivation of \"amnestic\" is somewhat questionable before too. But it established itself very early. There's some other parts of very, very early SCP lore that are pretty questionable; flinging arbitrary numbers of the so-called \"D-Class\" death row inmates into the waiting maw of a cosmic horror has become fairly disfavored for a variety of reasons over time too, for instance.

    "originBody": "How to avoid losing items? Holding pens. July 7, 2024 I put it in a safe spot. -- a phrase my mom would always say when she’d lost something. Why do we lose things inside our homes? When we are interrupted or need to hastily respond to a new demand, we often make quick decisions about where to place physical items. We always place them in locations which make sense given our current state of mind, but often that state of mind is fleeting, and so we forget where we put our things. The ideal solution is to have assigned place(s) for each item, and only ever store items in their assigned places. For example, my keys are only ever allowed in my back right pocket, the keychain hook in my backpack, or the bottom-left cubby of my nightstand. However, we regularly run into 1.) items which are too transient/unimportant to have memorable assigned place, 2.) instances where we don’t have time to take the item to it’s assigned place (e.g., because it’s in another room). Solution Holding Pens: designated areas in every room which exist to hold anchorless items. A holding pen: Is a tray roughly 12\" x 18\", so it can fit most items you need to put down. Has a small lip on the sides, so items don’t fall out. Is located in every room, so the activation energy to use a holding pen is approximately the same as placing the item down randomly. Is always used to store items, unless an item is being placed in its permanent location. Is cleaned out regularly—ideally daily, at most weekly—, so that it doesn’t become a storage area.",

Holding pens (alexwendland.com)339 points by surprisetalk 19 hours agohidepastfavorite218 comments treetalker 15 hours agoMy approach is to have separate “take-off” points near the entrance/exit of each room. Example: If I’m in my home office and find that some things need to go to the living room and some to the kitchen, I simply queue them to take off instead of taking a trip every time I realize an item needs to go. Then when I take a coffee break, I’ll grab all the items; drop the living-room items off on the way to the kitchen, and drop the kitchen items off when I arrive. I get my coffee; grab anything queued up on the kitchen take-off point that can be dropped off on the way, and drop them off on my way back. As it works out, everything is almost always where it ought to be; and when it’s not, I know where it will be instead. The key is that I always check the take-off point every time I leave a room. reply leokennis 11 hours agoparentThis is a good idea, as is the idea in the article. The basic requisite however is a desire to not lose stuff. My wife always loses track of her EarPods. My oldest kid always loses his pocket knife. I could have 20 holding pens in the house and they'd still lose their stuff, since the idea that you have to exert even a minor amount of effortby putting stuff in its place to save yourself much more searching effort , is either lost on them, or they just greatly value the present over the future. I do not even get annoyed about it anymore - just like I do not get annoyed that it turns dark at night. My stuff is always in its place, and before we leave the house they will spend 10 minutes finding theirs. reply mewpmewp2 6 hours agorootparentIt is easy to say to do this, but in reality what happens is I am deep in my thoughts and all of it happens on autopilot. I consciously understand it would save me time to put them correctly away, but there is just nothing triggering me to do it. If I had a very intelligent watch that dinged me every time I'm supposed to do it, I would do it. The tech is not there yet though. I think it's the multiple processes going on in the brain, where there's a process that will scan for danger, and this same track is able to break out of the deep thought process. I have to assume this same process just doesn't see those points as something that should interrupt the deep thought process. The same process with any novel activity will be much more sensitive, but as I do more of the same activity it will consider it a safe activity. The more I do something, the more I would be on autopilot allowing the deep thought process to go on. For example when I am in a new place, after moving or whatever reason, it is easier in the beginning for me to stay organized because the process is still sensitive and is more careful, but the more I get complacent the less I will be thinking about where to put the things and the deep thought track will be fully prioritised. reply kayodelycaon 5 hours agorootparentprevI really do not like the assumption people don’t do something because they don’t want to it. I really want to make the system work reliably but I can’t. I’ve spent 30+ years trying to make things work. They just don’t. It works when I have planned to do things ahead of time, but I can’t get my brain to remember to do it when interrupted, the attention shift doesn’t trigger “callbacks” or “publish events”. This is a fundamental prerequisite to make this work. People’s who can do this will have difficulty not understanding people who can’t. This same problem applies to “thinking before I speak”. I can’t do that. People think I can because I don’t make the same mistakes by rote learning what not to say in specific situations. I can’t anticipate new mistakes or generalize previous ones. reply chrisweekly 5 hours agorootparentprevA tip that's helped me: when you finally find the thing you misplaced, and are done with it, don't put it back where you found it, put it in the place where you first looked. reply inimino 1 hour agorootparentThis reminds me of a rule I have for naming things in code (functions, variables, etc). Say you add a function, and then the first time you call that function, you call it by a different name. Don't fix the function call to match the original name, but instead go back and change the name to match how you tried to call it. The state of mind you are in when you called the function is a better guide to naming than the state of mind you were in when you implemented it. reply glitchc 5 hours agorootparentprevClever! reply mauvehaus 5 hours agorootparentprevMy wife and I are very similar to you and your wife.

Some people find that cognitively more difficult than others. If you are the type of person to intensively multitask, to occupy your short-term memory with different trains of thought in a holding pattern, you will tend to sacrifice command skills - if your memory is already busy reading and writing on all available channels, it isn't going to pop up \"You have something in the oven\" or \"You were holding a pen a minute ago and you set it down on the second tier of the brown bookshelf\" or \"You need to get the kid from school\". The internet & smartphone era has unlocked a degree of hyperstimulus that can veer into the pathological for those of us with our brains wired a certain way. This is also a thing if you're doing things at a 'normal' degree of focus but your memory is impaired (number of operational channels reduced) in some other fashion, through age-related cognitive decline or some types of medication or chronic sleep deprivation or a TBI. This is the ADD trait. We are chronically late to important events, we lose things all the time, we frequently accumulate a thousand browser tabs, we jump from thing to thing as they come up. Forming subconscious routines is difficult, and when we do it, we often allocate them only the barest muscle memory - I lock my car regardless of whether it's already locked or should be locked (bringing in groceries) because my macro for leaving the car is to lock it. There are pros and there are cons to this cognitive style. But it's certainly not a matter of DESIRE to do things or CARELESSNESS. What helps? I find: * Writing things down, especially notes.txt * Snapping pictures of things as easier form of notes * Scheduled phone reminders * Getting sufficient sleep * Getting more than sufficient sleep - leaving an extra hour in bed to think about things, plan your day * \"Bookmark all tabs\" reply vladvasiliu 3 hours agorootparent> Snapping pictures of things as easier form of notes How do you get a hold of the picture later?

I have a keypad door lock so I’be been able to get rid of my front door key.

I was _constantly_ leaving for work, only to turn around because my wife called and said \"you forgot your badge, you forgot your wallet\", etc. What changed this was a trick I learned from working IT in a large manufacturing company. We got to walk the line and learn from our customers, and one thing they had at critical stations were poka-yoke(0) trays. Think a molded plastic tray filled with exactly all of the things the operator needed to do their assembly, the bolts and nuts and fixtures and what not. So if you were attaching a pulley to a shaft you had a spot that held one pulley, one for a set screw, etc., and the spot was designed for only the right size screw so if it too long or too short you knew you had a problem. On each assembly the operator knew if their tray wasn't full when they started assembling or if it had extra parts in it there was a problem, and when they ended assembly if the tray wasn't empty something wasn't done properly. One day I had the epiphany that this might just work for me, so I decided to make my own: I bought some craft foam and a plastic tray, and traced/cut spots in the foam for everything I needed for work – my keys, badge, watch, etc. Then every day when I came home my work things went into the poka-yoke, and I forced myself to not leave the entryway until it was completely full ... so no more \"oh guess my wallet is in the car\", I had to go get it and put it in. Every morning when I was leaving for work I'd empty it. My mornings went from ten+ minutes of me cursing and searching for my keys to... nothing.

For every item you consider removing, you think up new ways in which you might need it in the future, or you say you will have a yard sale and make a little bit of money back, neither of which are realistic. I think the problem is further exacerbated for people growing up in scarcity, so they are used to frugal operations, and are unable to cope with modern day flood of goods. Our parents are a good example, they save plastic grocery bags, all boxes, all original containers even for e.g. a coffee maker. \"Just in case we will sell it one day\".

It's more just what works for the space and flow. For instance, I have identical milkcrate size boxes at the bottom and top of the stairs. Why? So I can exchange them interchangably and they are easy to drop stuff into as I pass. I take the bottom of the stairs upstairs to sort and I take the top of the stairs downstairs then just toss the bin back to the closest spot so I don't have to climb stairs... lowest energy possible. In another case, I have a small-ish tub for assorted wires. The workflow is I have a big box of wires that are sorted into baggies, I pull a wire out, I use it, I put it in the small bin, then I sort the small bin back into baggies in one go. It fits on my shelf and the intention was to prevent it from becoming unsorted wires... which it unfortunately has because I can't keep it up.

My little computer science brain is simple but if I can remember small tricks, particularly with the arrangement of everyday things, I find joy somehow. A couple of my favorites are like if I need to remember to do something in the groggy morning, I put either my wallet or keys wrapped around something weird. When I awaken and go to find those items, I am awoken to the specific thing to remember to do or bring. I never forget my wallet (very fortunately for me), so if I find a large paper or pen or something very odd in the fold which would absolutely never belong there under normal circumstances, then it triggers the reminder. It also helps that I usually just forget the memory /trigger/, not the actual memory of what to donor bring. Another simple one is I rotate a couple supplements. How do I recall which to take? I stack them. I always put the one I /should/ take next on top. The way I remember this is I fall back to a base case: say I forget my little trick, well, I tell myself to grab the top one. So either I remember my trick, or I do the simple thing and just grab the top one. Either way I have at least made it through today with the correct one. Then I put it on the bottom and am primed for being forgetful tomorrow. I am still working on arranging shirts in a fifo queue in my closet on the rack. Or more clever, I put it back on the top and treat the rack as sort of a heap data structure, things worn recently are always to the left. If I want to wear it not so much, I put it deeper down the line. Then when searching I always start from the top (left for me) and know I probably wore a lot of these items recently. This also helps because I tend to wear only a fraction of my shirts, usually my favorites. Again, they are towards the left so they are easier to find. reply coldpie 5 hours agoparent> A couple of my favorites are like if I need to remember to do something in the groggy morning, I put either my wallet or keys wrapped around something weird.

Leave the bedroom wastepaperbasket on the bed if the bins need to go out later. And the takeoff points someone else suggested - things to go downstairs pile up at the top of the stairs, things to go to he kitchen pile up on the cupboard by the kitchen door, etc. On clothes, I suggest a FIFO order, then occasionally garbage collect from the out end to identify clothes you haven't worn in a long time and keep skipping over when it's time to dress.

If I cannot put it in my pocket, I put it near me in some salient way, and goes to 2 after current task is done; 5. If something is constantly out-of-place, rethink the designated place for that item. Step 4 is dependent on the fact that the space is well-organized in the first place, such that I could put item in a way that is salient and jarring to future me. If I'm surrounded by a mess, it probably wouldn't work. For example, I often perch something that I have to carry to my room in the middle of the kitchen island while I'm chopping and cooking. It works because the surface is almost always empty. If the kitchen island is already crowded, this wouldn't have worked. But I think the real secret to how to get the system working, is to do step 2 as much as I could, and avoid step 3 & 4 if at all possible.

Unfortunately, this only works where the feet have stopped growing, and where the choice of fashion makes this feasible. Mostly, that's adult men with standard black or otherwise dark socks.

The first thought that comes to mind is where you store it. Next time you look for the item it is right where you would search first. reply atoav 12 hours agoparentThis is good advice. But I'd like to extend it to: and if the place you first would look for sucks consider making a better one. E.g. if your stapler goes missing a lot and clutters your desk, relabel an easy to access drawer to \"desk stuff\" and put it in there. Put all other small things that fit the description in there. Return desk stuff into the desk stuff drawer. Should you now have a hundred pens, consider breaking them out into a pens and markers drawer etc. This is really not rocket science, but you need to care a bit about the fact that you now became the official bouncer for the desk stuff drawer and you should not let other stuff into it. And when you find a stapler in the kitchen, you take it and put it in the one place that makes sense: the desk stuff drawer. And you can create many such drawers, and with a certain amount of things you will have to.

During my holidays as a kid, I used to spend a few weeks at my uncle's place, which was a _Scrooge mcducks mansion_ (I could sleep in a different room every day for the whole duration of my stay without sleeping twice in the same one) and it was a wonder of organization. Everything had a specific spot allocated, everything was labelled and there were several inventory books. As a kid it was absolutely fantastic : it was better than a store because they had stuff that I never seen before and it was free to use. Thanks to that I then adopted a similar strategy myself (short of the inventory books) even though I live in a small flat. The amount of time I save with this and the peace of mind...

Which might be true, as there's a lot of things in life that gets much easier when you have surplus of space (a major reason people leave their city apartments and build or buy houses on the outskirts) - in general, having a large surplus of resources, such as food, water, time or money, tends to improve efficiency. Over-provisioning for the win. Anecdotally, this checks out for me too - the smaller the home (relative to number of people in it), the messier it seems to be. Perhaps the reason is the same as why computers slow down when low on memory or storage space - when you're running low on space, any random spot you pick is likely already taken, and storing anything requires you to first rearrange stuff already there. Which, for humans, means you likely won't do it and just drop the thing in the first free spot you can find. reply dools 10 hours agorootparent> The conclusion seems to be: keeping things in order is easy (or easier) if you have lots and lots of free space.

    "originLink": "https://alexplescan.com/posts/2024/08/10/wezterm/",
    "originBody": "Okay, I really like WezTerm 10 August 2024Permalink A while back my friend recommended that I try WezTerm. I’d been an iTerm 2 stalwart for the better part of a decade, but not to be too narrow-minded I conceded, started it up, and saw this: Does the job, sure, but doesn’t feel quite right. Okay then, experiment over. Back to iTerm… Fast forward a couple of months and I got the itch to try a new terminal again. I wanted to use one whose config was entirely text based so I could pop it in to my dotfiles and share it across my work and personal machines. A few terminals already do this, but whispers of WezTerm’s powerful API and Lua config got me particularly interested. I tried it again with a bit more patience and I’m glad I did. My terminal is prettier than it’s ever been, more functional, and I can finally justify my mechanical keyboard purchase with all the keybindings I’ve configured. This post is an introduction to configuring WezTerm based on the setup that I eventually landed on. I’d consider it relatively low-frills. Most of what I talk about here can already be found in WezTerm’s docs, but as they’ve got a large surface area, I’m hoping this post will be a useful jumping off point for WezTerm beginners. We won’t be looking at some of WezTerm’s key features, like custom hyperlinks highlighting rules, searchable scrollback, quick copy mode, and image support (you can find more details here). The feature I find most exciting about WezTerm is the flexibility of its Lua config, so we’ll be focusing on that. This includes configuring appearance, keybindings, multiplexing, workspace navigation, status bar setup, and dynamic theming. By the end of it all, we’ll have a terminal that looks like this: Subtly prettier than the default, and with some great features to boot. I use macOS, so what follows is focused on ergonomics that make WezTerm great there. I haven’t tested my config on other systems, but I’m not doing anything too bespoke so things should be portable (WezTerm works pretty much everywhere). tl;dr? Here’s a gist containing the config we’ll end up with. Pre-flight checks Start by installing WezTerm. Instructions for this are on WezTerm’s site. If you’re on macOS and reading this you probably have Homebrew installed, so $ brew install wezterm will do the trick. Now launch WezTerm, and you’re already winning. A note on Lua My favourite WezTerm feature is its use of Lua for defining config. Unlike terminals where your settings are adjusted via the UI (iTerm 2), your WezTerm config lives in your dotfiles and is portable across all your machines. And unlike other terminals where your configuration is written using a data serialization format like YAML or TOML (Alacritty, kitty), with Lua you can more easily achieve complex configs by leveraging dynamic scripts. Granted, Lua is a programming language so it is trickier to learn than YAML or TOML, but it’s still remarkably simple. If you’ve used another dynamic programming language (e.g. Ruby, Python, JavaScript) - you should be able to read the Lua code in this post easily. For achieving more complex configs, I’d recommend diving deeper into the language. Its Getting Started guide is a good place to… get started. Config files, and the best feedback loop in town WezTerm supports loading in its config from all the usual places on your system (docs). For this guide we’re going to be creating our config in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wezterm/wezterm.lua. On most systems (including macOS) this resolves to ~/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua. Using a directory to store our config instead of dumping it in ~/.wezterm.lua will let us keep our config logically grouped as we split some of it out into different files. Create the wezterm.lua file on that path, and add this boilerplate to it: -- Import the wezterm module local wezterm = require 'wezterm' -- Creates a config object which we will be adding our config to local config = wezterm.config_builder() -- (This is where our config will go) -- Returns our config to be evaluated. We must always do this at the bottom of this file return config Save the file and all going well… nothing will happen. Well, at least nothing appeared to happen, but what WezTerm did behind the scenes is quite magical. It watched your config file, and when it changed it auto-reloaded instantly. This feature makes for a wonderfully tight feedback loop where you don’t need to restart your terminal to see the effects of your new config. We can quickly test this auto-reload by adding some invalid syntax and seeing what happens. Replace the call to wezterm.config_builder() with wezterm.config_builderZ(), save, and you should immediately see a window pop-up with: runtime error: [string \"/Users/alex/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua\"]:2: attempt to call a nil value (field 'config_builderZ') stack traceback: [string \"/Users/alex/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua\"]:2: in main chunk How’s that for a feedback loop? Fix the error and save the file again. This time, have your config log something: wezterm.log_info(\"hello world! my name is \" .. wezterm.hostname()) Save. Now… where did that log go? Press CTRL + SHIFT + L to bring up the debug overlay (docs) and lo and behold, your beautiful log was waiting for you all along. Not only that but what you’re looking at is a full Lua REPL. Enter 1 + 1 and you’ll see the result. Enter wezterm.home_dir and you’ll see the result of accessing the home_dir entry on the wezterm module (docs). The combination of hot reloading and the debug overlay makes experimenting with WezTerm configs extremely low friction and low consequence. The feedback loop is so tight now it’s more like a feedback lp. Configuring appearance Okay enough gushing - let’s cut to the chase and make this thing prettier. Add a few lines to the config to start customising the look of the terminal. We’ll start with a colour scheme (docs): -- Pick a colour scheme. WezTerm ships with more than 1,000! -- Find them here: https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/colorschemes/index.html config.color_scheme = 'Tokyo Night' Save, and you should immediately see it update. Thanks Wez! (if the hot config reload doesn’t work for whatever reason, you can manually reload it by pressing CMD + R). Many colours, all at once With over 1,000 colour choices to choose from, it’s tough to decide on your favourite. Why not outsource that work to your computer? Let’s explore the power of WezTerm’s dynamic config by randomly assigning a colour scheme for each new window you open: -- Creates a lua table containing the name of every color scheme WezTerm -- ships with. local scheme_names = {} for name, scheme in pairs(wezterm.color.get_builtin_schemes()) do table.insert(scheme_names, name) end -- When the config for a window is reloaded (i.e. when you save this file -- or open a new window)... wezterm.on('window-config-reloaded', function(window, pane) -- Don't proceed if the config has already been overriden, otherwise -- we'll enter an infinite loop of neverending colour scheme changes. -- If that sounds like your kinda thing, then remove this line ;) - but -- don't say you haven't been warned. if window:get_config_overrides() then return end -- Pick a random colour scheme name. local scheme = scheme_names[math.random(#scheme_names)] -- Assign it as an override for this window. window:set_config_overrides { color_scheme = scheme } -- And log it for good measure wezterm.log_info(\"Your colour scheme is now: \" .. scheme) end) Open up a few windows (CMD + N on macOS) and each one will have a different colour scheme. A cornucopia of terminals, each more surprising than the last. We, my friends, are truly innovating now. But really, that was kind of a dumb idea meant to prove a point. Now that you’ve gotten a taste for dynamic config, you probably wanna remove those lines and stick to a colour scheme you do like. (You may find that after you remove that code and add your static color_scheme config back in, it doesn’t hot reload. That’s because our script set an override on the config specific to each window. To clear your overrides, you can go to your debug terminal and type window:set_config_overrides({}) - or you can just close and reopen your WezTerm window). Respecting the system’s appearance Light themes, dark themes… why not both? Let’s have the terminal’s colour scheme automatically change when the operating system’s appearance changes. While we’re at it, we’ll learn how to split up WezTerm config into different modules. Create a new file alongside wezterm.lua and call it appearance.lua. Add this to it: -- We almost always start by importing the wezterm module local wezterm = require 'wezterm' -- Define a lua table to hold _our_ module's functions local module = {} -- Returns a bool based on whether the host operating system's -- appearance is light or dark. function module.is_dark() -- wezterm.gui is not always available, depending on what -- environment wezterm is operating in. Just return true -- if it's not defined. if wezterm.gui then -- Some systems report appearance like \"Dark High Contrast\" -- so let's just look for the string \"Dark\" and if we find -- it assume appearance is dark. return wezterm.gui.get_appearance():find(\"Dark\") end return true end return module Back in wezterm.lua: -- Import our new module (put this near the top of your wezterm.lua) local appearance = require 'appearance' -- Use it! if appearance.is_dark() then config.color_scheme = 'Tokyo Night' else config.color_scheme = 'Tokyo Night Day' end Toggle your system appearance between dark mode and light mode, and watch your theme change right before your eyes. Fonts Next up let’s look at fonts. WezTerm ships with the lovely JetBrains Mono, and Nerd Font Symbols (docs) so there’s nothing to complain about there. I do prefer Berkeley Mono at 13 points though, so: -- Choose your favourite font, make sure it's installed on your machine config.font = wezterm.font({ family = 'Berkeley Mono' }) -- And a font size that won't have you squinting config.font_size = 13 There’s good support for ligatures and other fancy font settings if you’re into that (docs), but I’m not so let’s move on. Window styling Let’s style our terminal’s window. This controls the chrome that appears around it, and can vary between operating systems. On macOS, I like the below: -- Slightly transparent and blurred background config.window_background_opacity = 0.9 config.macos_window_background_blur = 30 -- Removes the title bar, leaving only the tab bar. Keeps -- the ability to resize by dragging the window's edges. -- On macOS, 'RESIZE|INTEGRATED_BUTTONS' also looks nice if -- you want to keep the window controls visible and integrate -- them into the tab bar. config.window_decorations = 'RESIZE' -- Sets the font for the window frame (tab bar) config.window_frame = { -- Berkeley Mono for me again, though an idea could be to try a -- serif font here instead of monospace for a nicer look? font = wezterm.font({ family = 'Berkeley Mono', weight = 'Bold' }), font_size = 11, } Now, let’s do something a little kitsch. See that empty space to the right of our terminal’s tab bar? Let’s fill it with a powerline looking status bar. We’ll add an update-status callback: wezterm.on('update-status', function(window) -- Grab the utf8 character for the \"powerline\" left facing -- solid arrow. local SOLID_LEFT_ARROW = utf8.char(0xe0b2) -- Grab the current window's configuration, and from it the -- palette (this is the combination of your chosen colour scheme -- including any overrides). local color_scheme = window:effective_config().resolved_palette local bg = color_scheme.background local fg = color_scheme.foreground window:set_right_status(wezterm.format({ -- First, we draw the arrow... { Background = { Color = 'none' } }, { Foreground = { Color = bg } }, { Text = SOLID_LEFT_ARROW }, -- Then we draw our text { Background = { Color = bg } }, { Foreground = { Color = fg } }, { Text = ' ' .. wezterm.hostname() .. ' ' }, })) end) A few interesting things happening here: We just used WezTerm’s events API with wezterm.on. Events are things that happen to the terminal (e.g. window resize) that we can define callbacks for. The update-status event is emitted periodically when the terminal is ready to have its status updated. WezTerm manages this cleverly to ensure that only one such update can run at any given time, and if your code takes too long to execute, a timeout will be hit and your handler will be abandoned… protecting your terminal from bogging down. We’re grabbing the effective_config() of the window to get the “effective” configuration, which is the config with any overrides applied. From this we can get the resolved_palette, which is the currently active colour scheme. To see what this data looks like you can enter the debug overlay (CTRL + SHIFT + L) and execute window:effective_config().resolved_palette. We’re using the wezterm.format function (docs) to style our string with colours. Other ways you could format text include setting font weight, underlining text, and more. Finally, the wezterm.hostname() function (docs) gives us the hostname of the machine we’re running on. WezTerm ships with a bunch of useful functions for getting the state of your system, and also… we’re doing stuff in Lua - so you have full access to your file system, are able to make network requests, etc. Altogether this gives us a powerline…ish. It’s a bit sad with only one segment isn’t it? Don’t you worry, we’ll be adding more soon… Keys Here’s the part where we justify our mechanical keyboard purchases. Let’s set up some key assignments. During this section we’ll look at WezTerm’s deep key handling capabilities and ability to take action based on your input. By default, WezTerm defines some standard key assignments (docs). I leave them on because they’re very sensible, but if you wanna really wrest total control of your config, you can turn them off with config.disable_default_key_bindings = true. Our first key assignment will be a humble start for us macOS users… you might be used to Option + Left Arrow and Option + Right Arrow jumping between words on your terminal. That’s the default in iTerm 2 and Terminal.app, but not in WezTerm. However, we can map it! We do this by adding a keys table to our config: -- Table mapping keypresses to actions config.keys = { -- Sends ESC + b and ESC + f sequence, which is used -- for telling your shell to jump back/forward. { -- When the left arrow is pressed key = 'LeftArrow', -- With the \"Option\" key modifier held down mods = 'OPT', -- Perform this action, in this case - sending ESC + B -- to the terminal action = wezterm.action.SendString '\\x1bb', }, { key = 'RightArrow', mods = 'OPT', action = wezterm.action.SendString '\\x1bf', }, } By now you’ve probably figured out that you’re gonna be spending more time configuring WezTerm than doing actual work. There’s no shame in admitting this reality, so let’s encode it into our config. On macOS, the default shortcut for opening an application’s preferences is CMD + , - let’s make it so when we press this, our favourite editor opens up the WezTerm config. I’m using neovim, but feel free to substitute with your own: config.keys = { -- ... add these new entries to your config.keys table { key = ',', mods = 'SUPER', action = wezterm.action.SpawnCommandInNewTab { cwd = wezterm.home_dir, args = { 'nvim', wezterm.config_file }, }, }, } Try that out, but you may see an error along the lines of: Unable to spawn nvim because: No viable candidates found in PATH \"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\" If that error showed up, it’s typically because the process that launched WezTerm didn’t include a PATH environment variable that led to your editor’s binary (e.g. on macOS, Finder is usually WezTerm’s parent). We can work around this by specifying the full path to your editor in the SpawnCommandInNewTab properties (docs), or by updating the default environment variables WezTerm spawns commands with. I prefer the latter, since it means that any other places in our config where we might spawn new commands will also inherit the same env vars: config.set_environment_variables = { PATH = '/opt/homebrew/bin:' .. os.getenv('PATH') } Try that again, and it should work. We really are just scratching the surface of all the commands available (WezTerm supports a lot). In the next section, we’ll be growing our key bindings further. Multiplexing terminals, levelling up key assignments Let’s move on to WezTerm’s multiplexing capabilities. If you make use of a multiplexer (i.e. tmux) then you may consider using WezTerm’s builtin capabilities instead. They’ll generally give you a more integrated experience, with individual scrollback buffers per pane, better mouse control, easier selection functionality, and generally faster performance. Hit CTRL + SHIFT + P to bring up WezTerm’s command palette. (Yes, WezTerm has a command palette. Yes, it’s as customisable as everything else we’ve seen so far. No, we won’t dwell on it here). Type split horizontally until the “Shell: Split Horizontally” option is selected and hit ENTER. Ta-da! Your shell split horizontally! Do the same for split vertically and… you get the idea. You may have noticed that the command palette displays the keyboard shortcut assigned to each action. The ones for splitting are quite a fingerful, e.g. SHIFT + CTRL + OPTION + \". I get why they’re this complicated - because they’re trying not to clash with any other shortcuts you may have on your system, but we can do a lot better - and WezTerm gives us the tools do so easily! Splitting panes, leader key A leader key (docs) is a special key combination that you press first, followed by another key combination, to perform a specific action. It can help you create complex shortcuts without needing to push a lot of keys all at once. Sounds like a perfect fit for splitting panes, right? We’ll bind our leader to CTRL + A, and in case you accidentally type the leader without following it up with another key, we’ll have it automatically deactivate after 1,000 milliseconds. -- If you're using emacs you probably wanna choose a different leader here, -- since we're gonna be making it a bit harder to CTRL + A for jumping to -- the start of a line config.leader = { key = 'a', mods = 'CTRL', timeout_milliseconds = 1000 } Next let’s define some key assignments for splitting panes: config.keys = { -- ... add these new entries to your config.keys table { -- I'm used to tmux bindings, so am using the quotes (\") key to -- split horizontally, and the percent (%) key to split vertically. key = '\"', -- Note that instead of a key modifier mapped to a key on your keyboard -- like CTRL or ALT, we can use the LEADER modifier instead. -- This means that this binding will be invoked when you press the leader -- (CTRL + A), quickly followed by quotes (\"). mods = 'LEADER', action = wezterm.action.SplitHorizontal { domain = 'CurrentPaneDomain' }, }, { key = '%', mods = 'LEADER', action = wezterm.action.SplitVertical { domain = 'CurrentPaneDomain' }, }, } Give it a go now. Press CTRL + A, quickly followed by \", and you’ll get a horizontal split. Use the other assignment and you’ll get a vertical split. Before we move on - you might be wondering what happens if you actually want to send the CTRL + A keypress without invoking the leader? CTRL + A is useful in and of its own as pressing it jumps to the start of a line on your shell (and on operating systems like Emacs). Well there’s a solution for that. We can map CTRL + A quickly followed by CTRL + A to send a CTRL + A to our terminal. That’s a confusing sentence! It’ll be simpler to just look at the config: config.keys = { -- ... add these new entries to your config.keys table { key = 'a', -- When we're in leader mode _and_ CTRL + A is pressed... mods = 'LEADER|CTRL', -- Actually send CTRL + A key to the terminal action = wezterm.action.SendKey { key = 'a', mods = 'CTRL' }, }, }, Moving around panes Okay with that done, let’s get back to multiplexing. Next up, navigating our splits. I like to use vim direction keybindings, but feel free to replace with arrow keys instead. config.keys = { -- ... add these new entries to your config.keys table { -- I like to use vim direction keybindings, but feel free to replace -- with directional arrows instead. key = 'j', -- or DownArrow mods = 'LEADER', action = wezterm.action.ActivatePaneDirection('Down'), }, { key = 'k', -- or UpArrow mods = 'LEADER', action = wezterm.action.ActivatePaneDirection('Up'), }, { key = 'h', -- or LeftArrow mods = 'LEADER', action = wezterm.action.ActivatePaneDirection('Left'), }, { key = 'l', -- or RightArrow mods = 'LEADER', action = wezterm.action.ActivatePaneDirection('Right'), }, } Look at all that duplication - We’re using a dynamic language for our config here, we don’t need to stand for that! Let’s go on a little side quest and see if we can extract it to a function. local function move_pane(key, direction) return { key = key, mods = 'LEADER', action = wezterm.action.ActivatePaneDirection(direction), } end config.keys = { -- ... remove the previous move bindings, and replace with move_pane('j', 'Down'), move_pane('k', 'Up'), move_pane('h', 'Left'), move_pane('l', 'Right'), } Ooh so much smaller, but it could be smaller still. I dare you to keep code golfing this down to 6 lines. Go on - I believe in you! Resizing panes, and introducing key tables You might’ve figured out that you can resize panes by dragging the edge of one with your mouse, but we’re developers here, not olympic athletes. What’re we expected to move our hands away from the safety of our keyboard and over to the mouse?! No! I won’t stand for it and neither should you! It’d be really nice to use the same keys that we use for moving between the panes for resizing (h, j, k, l)… but they’ve already been mapped… we could add another key modifier that needs to be held down when we want to resize vs. move between the panes: config.keys = { -- ... add this new entry to your config.keys table { key = 'h', mods = 'LEADER|CTRL', -- \"3\" here is the amount of cells we wish to resize -- the terminal by action = wezterm.action.AdjustPaneSize { 'Left', 3 }, }, } But that’s no good really. We have to first push our leader CTRL + A, then push CTRL + H, and keep repeating that each time we wanna resize the pane to the left. Fingers getting sore. Send help. Oh, here comes WezTerm with the antidote: key tables. When you activate a key table you’re entering a different mode with its own set of assignments for whatever you’re doing. This allows you to have multiple layers of assignments that are context specific. It’s a similar kind of concept to the leader key, but unlike it, our key table will not automatically deactivate after an action is invoked, so it’ll be a good fit for resizing, where we want to keep pressing the same button over and over again until we’re happy with our pane’s new size. With all that… this is easier done that said, so let’s check out the code: local function resize_pane(key, direction) return { key = key, action = wezterm.action.AdjustPaneSize { direction, 3 } } end config.keys = { -- ... remove the yucky keybinding from above and replace it with this { -- When we push LEADER + R... key = 'r', mods = 'LEADER', -- Activate the `resize_panes` keytable action = wezterm.action.ActivateKeyTable { name = 'resize_panes', -- Ensures the keytable stays active after it handles its -- first keypress. one_shot = false, -- Deactivate the keytable after a timeout. timeout_milliseconds = 1000, } }, } config.key_tables = { resize_panes = { resize_pane('j', 'Down'), resize_pane('k', 'Up'), resize_pane('h', 'Left'), resize_pane('l', 'Right'), }, } Now you can push CTRL + A to activate leader, then R to activate the resizing layer… and movement keys to resize to your heart’s content. When 1,000 milliseconds have elapsed, you’ll automatically exit the resizing layer and be back to the default keytable. WezTerm intensifies… (While we’re on multiplexing, if you’re using neovim, I’d recommend checking out smart-splits.nvim - that’ll let you jump between your vim panes and your WezTerm ones). Project workspaces Okay let’s graduate from WezTerm university with one final assignment… project workspaces. I’m often working across a few different projects at a time, and need to be able to quickly switch between them. I want each project to maintain its own multiplexer instance with its own windows, panes, and tabs. In tmux you might achieve this with different sessions. In WezTerm we’ll do it with workspaces. Creating and switching between workspaces Create a new file in your config directory and call it projects.lua. We’ll use this to provide some project switching functions to our main config file. local wezterm = require 'wezterm' local module = {} local function project_dirs() return { '~/Projects/mailgrip', '~/Projects/alexplescan.com', '~/Projects/wezterm_love_letters', -- ... keep going, list all your projects -- (or don't if you value your time. we'll improve on this soon) } end function module.choose_project() local choices = {} for _, value in ipairs(project_dirs()) do table.insert(choices, { label = value }) end -- The InputSelector action presents a modal UI for choosing between a set of options -- within WezTerm. return wezterm.action.InputSelector { title = 'Projects', -- The options we wish to choose from choices = choices, -- Yes, we wanna fuzzy search (so typing \"alex\" will filter down to -- \"~/Projects/alexplescan.com\") fuzzy = true, -- The action we want to perform. Note that this doesn't have to be a -- static definition as we've done before, but can be a callback that -- evaluates any arbitrary code. action = wezterm.action_callback(function(child_window, child_pane, id, label) -- As a placeholder, we'll log the name of what you picked wezterm.log_info(\"you chose \" .. label) end), } end return module … and in your wezterm.lua: local projects = require 'projects' config.keys = { -- ... add these new entries to your config.keys table { key = 'p', mods = 'LEADER', -- Present in to our project picker action = projects.choose_project(), }, { key = 'f', mods = 'LEADER', -- Present a list of existing workspaces action = wezterm.action.ShowLauncherArgs { flags = 'FUZZY|WORKSPACES' }, }, } Lots going on here, take your time to read it and the comments. And give it a go! Push LEADER + P, and you’ll see the project input selector come up. Pick a project by highlighting one and pushing ENTER, or push CTRL + C to close the picker. Once you’ve picked a project you’ll see its directory logged to your debug overlay (CTRL + SHIFT + L). Still a couple of issues though… it’s really annoying to type out all your projects by hand in that file, and, uh, what was the other issue? Oh yeah! When you pick a project nothing happens. Okay, let’s fix these. Back in projects.lua, we’ll start by having the list of projects automatically populate. -- The directory that contains all your projects. local project_dir = wezterm.home_dir .. \"/Projects\" local function project_dirs() -- Start with your home directory as a project, 'cause you might want -- to jump straight to it sometimes. local projects = { wezterm.home_dir } -- WezTerm comes with a glob function! Let's use it to get a lua table -- containing all subdirectories of your project folder. for _, dir in ipairs(wezterm.glob(project_dir .. '/*')) do -- ... and add them to the projects table. table.insert(projects, dir) end return projects end (This all assumes that you like to keep your projects grouped together in a folder, if not… well you’ve got Lua at your fingertips to implement whatever you want!) Now launch the project picker, and what do you see? All those projects staring back at thee. One thing left to do, let’s add the functionality that opens your project in a new WezTerm workspace. Still in projects.lua let’s change up choose_project: function module.choose_project() local choices = {} for _, value in ipairs(project_dirs()) do table.insert(choices, { label = value }) end return wezterm.action.InputSelector { title = \"Projects\", choices = choices, fuzzy = true, action = wezterm.action_callback(function(child_window, child_pane, id, label) -- \"label\" may be empty if nothing was selected.

We'll spawn a new terminal with the current working -- directory set to the directory that was picked. spawn = { cwd = label }, }, child_pane) end), } end Try that out, select a new project, and you’ll see a workspace get created for it. Switch back to your default workspace (we bound so LEADER, CTRL + F to show you a list of active workspaces) and you’ll see everything is right where you left it. Bonus: improving the powerline, and more colour stuff Let’s add a couple of polishing touches to this workflow and then I promise we’ll be done… Remember that sad powerline we set up earlier? Let’s make it happier by adding another segment to it which contains the name of the current workspace. In true powerline fashion, each subsequent segment on the powerline will display in a different colour. We’ll explore some of WezTerm’s colour maths support and do this all dynamically based on our theme. Back in wezterm.lua: -- Replace the old wezterm.on('update-status', ... function with this: local function segments_for_right_status(window) return { window:active_workspace(), wezterm.strftime('%a %b %-d %H:%M'), wezterm.hostname(), } end wezterm.on('update-status', function(window, _) local SOLID_LEFT_ARROW = utf8.char(0xe0b2) local segments = segments_for_right_status(window) local color_scheme = window:effective_config().resolved_palette -- Note the use of wezterm.color.parse here, this returns -- a Color object, which comes with functionality for lightening -- or darkening the colour (amongst other things). local bg = wezterm.color.parse(color_scheme.background) local fg = color_scheme.foreground -- Each powerline segment is going to be coloured progressively -- darker/lighter depending on whether we're on a dark/light colour -- scheme. Let's establish the \"from\" and \"to\" bounds of our gradient. local gradient_to, gradient_from = bg if appearance.is_dark() then gradient_from = gradient_to:lighten(0.2) else gradient_from = gradient_to:darken(0.2) end -- Yes, WezTerm supports creating gradients, because why not?! Although -- they'd usually be used for setting high fidelity gradients on your terminal's -- background, we'll use them here to give us a sample of the powerline segment -- colours we need. local gradient = wezterm.color.gradient( { orientation = 'Horizontal', colors = { gradient_from, gradient_to }, }, #segments -- only gives us as many colours as we have segments. ) -- We'll build up the elements to send to wezterm.format in this table. local elements = {} for i, seg in ipairs(segments) do local is_first = i == 1 if is_first then table.insert(elements, { Background = { Color = 'none' } }) end table.insert(elements, { Foreground = { Color = gradient[i] } }) table.insert(elements, { Text = SOLID_LEFT_ARROW }) table.insert(elements, { Foreground = { Color = fg } }) table.insert(elements, { Background = { Color = gradient[i] } }) table.insert(elements, { Text = ' ' .. seg .. ' ' }) end window:set_right_status(wezterm.format(elements)) end) WezTerm delivers yet again. This updated callback supports arbitrary numbers of segments for its powerline. We’ve specified 3 but you could add way more. All this without needing to manually configure what colour we want on each segment, but rather have WezTerm do it for us by creating a gradient based on the currently active theme. Some highlights: We use wezterm.color.parse to convert a string containing a hex colour code into a Color object (docs) - this lets us perform more advanced operations on the color. The colour scheme’s background colour is still what we want to use as the value that our gradient draws to, but to figure out where the gradient should start, we use either color:darken (docs) or color:lighten to create a new colour. The gradient itself is made with wezterm.color.gradient (docs), which returns a table containing a evenly spaced colours between our gradient_to and gradient_from. We then iterate over our powerline segments to create the items required for wezterm.format. Where to from here? There’s a lot more that WezTerm does and that you can do with WezTerm. By now you’ll have a good understanding of WezTerm config fundamentals, but I encourage you to keep exploring! If you’ve followed this guide step by step, I’d recommend pruning the config down to things that you’ll actually use, rewriting it in your own style, then start sprinkling in your own stuff. Take ownership of this thing! Make your own beautiful WezTerm snowflake! When you want some inspiration for what you could do next, browse through the WezTerm API docs to see what’s possible.

Was using kitty before that – loved the set up and simplicity coming from iTerm2. WezTerm is leaps and bounds better in terms of what comes out-of-the-box. My terminal config is short enough to sit all in one screen on my editor. After that, the terminal just... gets out of the way and I don't need to think about it. But the straw that broke my back with using kitty was, I'd end up encountering issues or trying to recreate some of iTerm2's features, only to end up time and again on kitty's maintainer's terse and dismissive comments. e.g. IIRC his answer to \"How do I set up tmux with kitty?\" was something like \"Don't, tmux is dumb\" and closing it. Eventually I gave up. reply throwanem 3 hours agoparentDoes WezTerm support an equivalent of iTerm's \"hotkey window\"? For those unfamiliar, that's a window tied to a show/hide keybinding which when shown floats above all other windows, making a terminal instantly available everywhere - a feature I could live without, but don't care to.

That his terminal fails to correctly render such stalwarts as the Linux \"make menuconfig\" UI and there are no settings to fix it as he doesn't believe in settings is, to me, telling. I then find reading his posts on issue trackers not just insulting, but even \"activating\" in a way that is really unhealthy, as it results in me feeling a need to \"defend\" some random bit of terminal usage with just as much vigor, lest he get away with making everyone else sound like THEY are crazy... it really isn't healthy. I can't know for sure--as we don't live in this reality--but I'd like to think that, even if he and I agreed on literally everything there is to do with terminals, that I'd still have the same mindset that I'd rather write my own terminal than ever use his. reply AdmiralAsshat 4 hours agorootparentRemember that this is the guy who said he would personally maintain python 2 because he didn't want to rewrite calibre for python 3 [0].

There is software that expects users to behave in certain ways and there is software where the developer is quite firm about what they will and will not implement. I would say that calibre and kitty fit into the latter category. These applications offer a lot of features and are very configurable, yet they also don't try to be everything to everyone.

And yes, it instantly grew on me, although (as I can see from this article) I have barely scratched the surface of its configurability. My only complaint is that its many features are not really discoverable. Sure, the documentation is really good, and the author is very engaged and helpful, but... one example: I looked up how to select large blocks of text using just the keyboard, I did it once, said to myself \"I have to remember this!\", then promptly forgot it and now I'm back to selecting text with the mouse like an absolute noob because all in all for the few times I do this it's faster than googling that documentation page again... (in case you're wondering, the page I mean is https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/copymode.html, not https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/quickselect.html, which sounds like what I was looking for, but is something completely different - also very handy and a great idea, but not what I was after) reply bbkane 3 hours agoparentI keep my Wezterm config in a dotfiles repo and I keep notes like this in the README ( https://github.com/bbkane/dotfiles/tree/master/wezterm ), precisely to find them easily later! reply barnabee 3 hours agoparentprevQuickselect mode is amazing though! It's useful out of the box but the superpower is that you can customise the regexes it matches.

In my case, when running WezTerm, the robotics simulation tool Gazebo Classic [0] would only launch properly 1/3 to 1/2 of the time. The rest of the time the simulation appeared to start, but no display ever came up and the program eventually segfalted. I thought this was a Gazebo problem, since it is a bit touchy, but switching to another GPU-accelerated terminal like Kitty or Alacritty solved the problem. I guess the lesson being, if your GL program is misbehaving when launching from WezTerm, try another terminal to see if that doesn't solve the problem.

I switched to Kitty, and while it has its share of issues, at least it works. reply cbm-vic-20 3 hours agoparentprevThe one thing I don't like about WezTerm, at least the reason why I stopped using it, is related to how it handles copying wrapped lines into the clipboard. It might just be me, and how I use tmux, but I found that when copying a line that gets wrapped, it includes a newline in the copied text. Very annoying, and I think it has to do with the interaction between WezTerm and tmux. I don't have enough evidence to create a good bug report, and I WezTerm has its own terminal multiplexing server (\"ssh domains\"), so it's probably not important enough to fix anyway. I don't want to install the WezTerm multiplexing server everywhere, and tmux is pretty much on all of the places that I ssh into already.

I'd been an iTerm2 user since I first started using macOS nearly ten years ago. I had really started to feel it slow down lately. It hit the breaking point when I was cmd-tab-ing and found myself waiting for more than a second just for the terminal to appear. Looked around, evaluated a couple alternatives and none of them quite fit my taste. One terminal required an account/login to operate, which is a big no IMO, another was written in {Java,Type}Script so simple commands like `yes` would break it due to the async nature of streams in node.js. I really like WezTerm so far. It's quite fast, very much configurable and comes with the theme I was configuring with iTerm2 out of the box (OneDark (base16)).

That opens up a massive potential for new behaviours and customization. Emacs uses Lisp in a similar way. What other applications use a programming language for their configuration? reply lawn 3 hours agoparentNeovim is the obvious example here, also relying on Lua. Neovim of course also supports Vimscript, although writing anything more complex is much nicer in Lua. reply kragen 2 hours agoparentprevprobably the most popular instances of this approach are firefox, chromium, and safari. the unix shell, godot, unity, unreal engine, truetype, and postscript are probably also worth a mention reply bbkane 3 hours agoparentprevNeoVim also uses Lua and I think nginx does too. reply johnmaguire 3 hours agoparentprevawesome-wm! reply selectnull 3 hours agoprevLike a few people in this thread, I was a decade long user of iTerm2. Can't really remember what was the reason to research other terminals, but I did and among those I tried, WezTerm was the clear winner. I vaguely remember my main requirement was being able to configure CMD+D and CMD+SHIFT+D as split panes vertically and horizontally as I wasn't willing to retrain my fingers to learn new keystrokes for that. Within a version of two after I switched (back then, those were weeks or less apart), all my complaints were resolved and I never looked back. My config is fairly minimal, but perfect for my needs. What else can one want? reply alskdj21 3 hours agoprevAs a neovim user, wezterm's lua config was a welcome surprise. Imo, its best feature is its command palette (Shift+Ctrl+P). Tremendously helps when you're just getting started. It has also a superb font-related configurations. I do hope I could map specific Unicode codepoints to a particular font, as is the case with kitty. In terms of use-case, I just disable all its keybindings and use it as a tmux terminal. I admit I didn't look for solutions, but I just can't go away from tmux's session restoration capabilities. reply sidmitra 5 hours agoprevhttps://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/colorschemes/ ^ There's a host of built-in color schemes. reply kokada 3 hours agoprevI also recently switched to WezTerm because it is the only terminal that seems to work cross-platform that is also well supported in Nix/nixpkgs. Before I was using Kitty in NixOS and iTerm2 in macOS, but having one configuration for both OS is good. P.S.: I am temporary back to Kitty in NixOS because I recently switched from Sway to Hyprland and the current release of WezTerm seems to be having some issues in Hyprland. But will switch back once this issue is solved, I know it is fixed in the main branch for example, but I would prefer to use nixpkgs cache instead of building it from source. reply ishaanbahal 5 hours agoprevThank you for this write-up!

This is somewhere in alacritty, *vim or tmux. So I futzed with all of them, tried different terminals, all while telling myself it couldn't be tmux. So I just ignored it for over a year. I finally went back and gave wezterm a serious try just a few weeks ago and I am very happy to have switched. The mouse issues I was seeing go away. Splitting panes and resizing lots of panes is fast and responsive. It's built in so copying from a vertical split pane doesn't include the other pane like in tmux. That doesn't make it perfect. Mouse themes are applied inconsistently as I use Gnome on Wayland. It also seems to be a problem when using neovim, but I can't prove it clearly enough to want to file a bug with anyone. Besides, everything I need to do still works and I rarely use the mouse unless I am copying random gobs of text. I am sticking with wezterm for the moment. I have no reason to leave it at this point and it helped me reduce the complexity of my stack a teeny bit. reply hypnotist 4 hours agoparentI use tmux daily. tried to like wezterm but issues with clipboard and resizing made look for another option.

If you use a window manager like sway then you can layout tabs, splits etc. to your heart's content for any type of window you like. You don't need a terminal emulator to do this for you. Given that I do already use a window manager like sway, is there much else worthwhile compared to any other terminal emulator? reply eredengrin 1 hour agoparentWezterm has built in ssh support where if you open a wezterm ssh window to a remote host and then open new tabs/splits within that window, the new tabs/splits are added as part of the existing ssh session automatically. It also allows you to host the session on the remote machine (kind of like tmux) and when you connect you get back all your previous tab/split organizations. From that perspective it can make sense to have the terminal own the layout organization. reply throwaway1194 5 hours agoprevDoes anyone know what the default colorscheme is on wezterm? reply anothername12 3 hours agoprevWhat are you all doing that requires such fine grain selection of a terminal?

This was especially noticeable when using helix inside of WSL - movement in normal mode would always sort of lag behind the keystrokes.

I moved from iTerm to Warp recently, before switching to wezterm, and the only reason i dropped Warp (despite signing in) was that it comes in your way a lot, the click to focus on blocks becomes a hindrance for me (I hardly care for the previous blocks), the constant reminders in Red to update and obviously the AI prompting, albeit to the side, they keep trying to find a way for me to use it, but I'd rather stick with CTRL+R or quick google search than write a coherent sentence explaining things to a LLM.

That's really interesting! I'd love to use this from Python, via something like https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-python or https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py - has anyone run PGlite via one of those wrappers yet? reply samwillis 3 hours agoparentGetting PGlite working with other languages is very high on my list. We are working on two approaches: - a WASI build with a lower level api that users can wrap with a higher level api. - a \"libpglite\" that can be linked to by any native language. The WASI build is likely a WASM build of this. Most languages already have a Postgres wire protocol implementation and so wrapping a low level API that reads/emits this is relatively easy - it's what the JS side of PGlite does. reply abrichr 1 hour agoparentprevAs a workaround, maybe something like this could work: db.js: const { PGlite } = require('@electric-sql/pglite'); const db = new PGlite(); async function execSQL(sql) { await db.exec(sql); return { success: true }; } async function querySQL(sql, params) { const ret = await db.query(sql, params); return ret.rows; } // Command-line interface logic const action = process.argv[2]; const sql = process.argv[3]; const params = process.argv.slice(4); if (action === 'exec') { execSQL(sql).then(result => { console.log(JSON.stringify(result)); process.exit(); }); } else if (action === 'query') { querySQL(sql, params).then(result => { console.log(JSON.stringify(result)); process.exit(); }); } main.py: import subprocess import json def execute_sql(sql: str) -> dict: result = subprocess.run( ['node', 'db.js', 'exec', sql], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True ) return json.loads(result.stdout) def query_sql(sql: str, params: list) -> list: result = subprocess.run( ['node', 'db.js', 'query', sql] + params, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True ) return json.loads(result.stdout) # Example Usage create_table_sql = \"\"\" CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todo ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, task TEXT, done BOOLEAN DEFAULT false ); \"\"\" execute_sql(create_table_sql) query_result = query_sql(\"SELECT * FROM todo WHERE id = $1\", [\"1\"]) print(query_result) reply samwillis 1 hour agorootparentWe have the (accidentally undocumented) execProtocolRaw api that lets you execute Postgres wire protocol messages.

I often dislike a lot of the simplicity behind SQLite in very similar ways as to things I don't care for with MySQL/MariaDB. reply creativedg 4 hours agoprevHuge fan of PGlite. It's the perfect solution to have Postgres without the need of Docker. With just `npm install`, you can have a Postgres instance on your computer. So, it's extremely easy to onboard a new developer in your team. And, the good news, PGlite works perfectly with Next.js. I'm using PGlite in local and development environment with Next.js Boilerplate: https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate With only one command `npm install`, you can have a full-stack application, which also includes the database (a working Postgres). And, no need to have/install external tools. reply tracker1 2 hours agoparentDefinitely interesting, though I often just use docker compose for dev dependencies, this is definitely a cool alternative. reply creativedg 1 hour agorootparentYes, it's very cool alternative and it removes the need for docker compose for dev environment. On top of it, PGlite also perfect for CI and testing. reply ggregoire 1 hour agorootparentWouldn't be easier to have a shared dev database? So that each developer doesn't have to apply the migrations and import the dumps in their local db, and figure out why the local db for dev A is different than the local db for dev B. reply motolov 42 minutes agorootparentIME, creating scaffolding to allow for a known, reproducible and clean state (of both DDL and DML) are wild systematic (eg across the team and the estate) productivity and stability boosts. Not having to be \"connected to the shared dev DB frees engineers of latency (every ms counts) and also of mutulple pollutants to that database (eg Sally was writing protractor/cypresss tests and now the foo table has 3m rows, george was doing data exploration and manually entered records to the DB that now causes a runtime exception fot the team, etc) If a shared dev DB is really what everyone wants, then at least having the scaffolding mentioned above to fix the DB state when pollution happens (it will) will help heal foot shots. In industrialized practice, what you are mentioning (a shared dev/env) is really the \"QA\"/pre-prod environment. Ideologically and personally (putting on down vote helmet) if you can't run the whole stack locally you're in for a world of trouble down the road.. local first, test extensively there, then promote changes. reply tracker1 15 minutes agorootparentprevA shared dev database can be okay for application dev. Locally deployable database is better imo. By nature of migration scripts running for every dev locally, it helps to better ensure the stability of said scripts. This can/should be combined with snapshot runs that represent your production environments. More critical still if you have more than one \"production\" environment, where in different customers/clients may be at different application and db versions from one-another. This is often the case for large business and govt work. With shared environments it's often too easy to have a poorly adapted set of migration scripts. reply andruby 1 hour agorootparentprevThat sounds cumbersome when devs are working in their respective branches and changing the schema (adding migrations) reply sgbeal 4 hours agoprevTo keep the next person from having to look (or ask without looking): it supports browser-side persistence via IndexedDB and OPFS:reply samwillis 4 hours agoparentYours and Roys work on WASM SQLite VFSs has directly influenced my work on this.

It worked pretty well and has much better DX than using something like testcontainers[0] to spin up postgres running in docker. [0]: https://testcontainers.com reply samwillis 2 hours agoparentI see unit and integration testing as a massive opportunity for PGlite. I know of projects (such as Drizzle ORM) that are already making good use of it. The team at Supabase have built pg-gateway (https://github.com/supabase-community/pg-gateway) that lets you connect to PGlite from any Postgres client. That's absolutely a way you could use it for CI. One thing I would love to explore (or maybe commenting on it here will inspire someone else ;-) ) is a copy on write page level VFS for PGLite. I could imagine starting and loading a PGlite with a dataset and then instantly forking a database for each test. Not complexities with devcontainers or using Postgres template databases. Sub ms forks of a database for each test. reply riverdroid 3 hours agoparentprevI would also love to use it this way in Go. Currently we dump SQLite compatible schema to use for SQLite powered integration tests even though we use postgres when live.

I’m even running SQLite in wasm so I don’t have any C dependencies. Switching out for Postgres would be awesome reply sam_perez 19 minutes agoprevOh cool, how would you compare this to DuckDB? reply satvikpendem 2 hours agoprevCongrats on the Show HN. I follow the ElectricSQL Discord server and I was distinctly interested in this but for other languages than TypeScript, so it's nice to see that making it language independent is high on your list. I also saw that ElectricSQL is being rewritten due to architectural changes, does that impact PGlite at all or are they separate projects now? What is the relationship between PGlite and ElectricSQL as well, just curious? Also, fun etymological thing, SQLite is actually SQL-ite, as in, urbanite, not SQ-Lite, but due to rebracketing [0] and libfixing [1], now people seem to use the -lite suffix rather than the -ite one, presumably because lite actually implies something whereas ite would not, as much. It's like how helicopter is actually helic and opter, a helical wing that spins, but now people think of it as heli and copter, calling other things related to it like helipad, or quadcopter, as Wikipedia states. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebracketing [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libfix reply samwillis 1 hour agoparentHey, yes, PGlite and Electric sync are separate projects, but we are very much building PGlite as a sync target for Electric. The changes we are making with Electric is towards a more loosely coupled stack, rather than the tightly integrated stack we had before. PGlite is one possible client store for Electric sync, and fulfils the use case where you want to have a full SQL database on the client along with (potentially) the same schema on client and server. The name is (obviously) a nod to SQLite, which goes without saying is an incredible database. We went with the small \"l\" in the name to add a slight differentiator and a nod towards \"light\", and we are a light weight Postgres. reply zooq_ai 1 hour agorootparentwhat kind of data load are we talking here? I know it gets stored locally. So, is it limited by my local disk size. How will it perform if I have 1TB of data? reply NetOpWibby 2 hours agoprevThis is exciting. My database of choice is EdgeDB, which uses Postgres under the hood. It's not so far-fetched to imagine EdgeDB in the browser now! reply saurik 4 hours agoprevDoes there happen to be a native analog to this? So like, if I eventually want some kind of native app, I wouldn't have to throw away the architecture entirely and start over? I only see mention of the WASM version of this in the website/docs. reply samwillis 4 hours agoparentIt's planned. We want to extract the core changes to Postgres that we had to make and create a \"libpglite\" C lib that can be linked to from any language/platform. Support important for React Native, as it doesn't have WASM support. reply nikki93 1 hour agorootparentThis would be nice also to have an API that's usable from C/C++ code running in Wasm. I see libraries often do this where they expose a C/C++ library like Postgres to Wasm and the main / documented API is JS and you have to dig a bit to find the C/C++ API if it's possible to access it that way. reply ZitchDog 50 minutes agoprev> it has a reactive \"live query\" API Very cool! Most of the examples for reactive queries are very basic (only single tables). Do live queries support joins / aggregations? reply samwillis 45 minutes agoparentYes, they should all work. We save the query as a view and then introspect it to see what tables it depends on. It then uses pg_notify to watch for changes.

The ability to replicate and subscribe to the changes, all within the browser seems incredibly powerful. Having worked on medical software that runs a 2,000,000+ patient workload that perform refills for chemotherapy/HIV/immuno drugs, where it was common for people to trample each others work as they ran insurance, called patients etc... We had to roll our own locking system that relied on interval functions (yay IE7) and websockets... This meant when you called the patient, someone running financial assistance would be unable to work on the same profile. I can envision other uses for FTS or even vector search locally, since they are insanely expensive at scale. reply TeeWEE 1 hour agoparentThat means getting those 2 million patients on every device... Really bad choice for medical software. reply metadat 3 hours agoprevHow did they manage to fit Postgres in 3MB? reply AlexErrant 2 hours agoparentAnswered here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41224295 > You might remember an earlier WASM build[1] that was around ~30MB. The Electric team [2] have gone one step further and created a complete build of Postgres that’s under 3MB. > Their implementation is technically interesting. Postgres is normally multi-process - each client connection is handed to a child process by the postmaster process. In WASM there’s limited/no support for process forking and threads. Fortunately, Postgres has a relatively unknown built-in “single user mode” [3] primarily designed for bootstrapping a new database and disaster recovery. Single-user mode only supports a minimal cancel REPL, so PGlite adds wire-protocol support which enables parametrised queries etc. reply FlyingSnake 2 hours agoprevPGLite is a wonderful achievement and I've a fan of it since it's early days. If they get it to a stage where other languages apart from JS can use it, it could be revolutionary.

How do they compare on memory usage and overhead? I already default to SQLite for new side projects with the idea that \"eventually I'll migrate to Postgres if this project gets legs\", so switching to PGlite feels like a no-brainer as long as it's not going to weigh my apps down or force me to upgrade out of whatever entry-level server solution I'm using is for a given project. EDIT: Found the benchmarks here https://pglite.dev/benchmarks reply samwillis 2 hours agoparentAh, you beat me to it, yes those benchmarks give you a good overview of baseline performance. But it'a a little nuanced as the underlying VFS performance is very significant. Both PGlite and SQLite in the browser is incredible. The latter is a little lighter weight and more mature, but PGlite brings with it all the type support and extensions that you love with Postgres. It comes down to what works best for your project. reply blueprint 2 hours agoprevAnyone know how this would play with at-rest encryption extensions? reply samwillis 1 hour agoparentThere are two options here: - Build a Postgres at-rest encryption extensions as WASM, that should \"just work\" as long as you can build the extension. - Create an encrypted VFS for PGlite. This is doable now, but we haven't yet documents the VFS API as we want to make it a little cleaner.

We have some micro-benchmarks here that have some baseline native numbers to compare to: https://pglite.dev/benchmarks Much of the complexity with WASM in the browser actually comes down to the performance of the underlying VFS for storage.

I used to fix things myself, but spending all my free time doing home repair was withdrawing from the limited bank account of my personal sanity. Having the house broken open for months while I picked away at it after work and on weekends was bad for morale, too. And doing the work myself was sometimes dispiriting rather than empowering—If someone else makes a mistake, even if I'm paying them, I can for whatever reason tolerate that with less frustration than when I screw up myself. Accepting that I am lucky enough to have a surplus of money that I can exchange for time and serenity was a big step for me. My conclusion was that cultivating a relationship with a good handyman is of as much value for me as any other long term service relationship: doctor, therapist, waitress, barista, etc. So, even though I'm not married and not having relationship angst per se, this article makes sense to me through that reinterpretation. reply segmondy 1 hour agoparentIt does come down to mindset.

I can't stand drywall work - although I'll do a patch'n'texture that's too small to hire out if i absolutely have to. The folks who do drywall for a living are magicians that can knock out the job 5x faster than me, and 20x better. I'll pay all day. Electrical on the other hand I find to be a blast. It's more a hobby than a chore, although there are some things I won't touch, like running conduit for lv or installing a sizable solar system. The pros are just so good at it. Cars too - I'll change every fluid, do brake jobs, install short shift kits, dashcams, even got a windows VM running so I could use old software to read OBD-I codes on my old car.

It's one of the few ways to actually keep almost all the value you generate. reply sokoloff 31 minutes agorootparentIndeed. For me to end up with the same amount of money after paying a company $100 rather than doing something myself, I have to go out and make an extra $167. That company probably then pays the actual worker something between $25 and $50, so I have to have a quite high multiple (plus the opportunity to just go work a small amount extra for pay) to make the trade make economic sense. reply ds_opseeker 9 minutes agorootparentAll of which is strong argument in favor of replacing all income tax with land tax.

If it's just to save money, that's nice, but the need to do it disappears when you have enough to spare. For me, I tend to want to fix things more the more my job is boring and I'm not able to work on new things or improve existing ones. I'll then take some satisfaction on actually being able to affect change, even if it is in my own environment. It can be a bit therapeutic. I will, however, delegate some work when I don't have the tools or the means to do it efficiently. I had an alternator failure. I could replace it myself, I know how. But the car in question has it in a pretty difficult to access location. It is doable but would probably take me the whole day (if not more) with just a jack and stands. So I sent it to the mechanic. And yes, if you are falling behind on your repairs or if you have to spend most of your free time to do it, it's not worth it, you need more hands. Also, if you actually don't have free time and you would use that time to earn more money. reply bluGill 1 hour agoparentprevSometimes I feel the same way.

I would say \"repair and remain\" is my preferred ethos as well. But the house/marriage comparison is an oversimplification that elides a lot of very common situations where leaving a marriage is justified. If anything about your house is broken, you can (in principle) just fix it. You don't need the house to agree or cooperate. Even if the house is burned out or full of black mold, remediation is always an option, subject only to the resources you can bring to bear. I dunno. It's tiresome to put qualifiers and disclaimers on everything. MAYBE in an article by a white Anglican Canadian small-business owner (such as myself except for the Anglican part), it just goes without saying that if your partner is a threat to you or your children's safety, or if there is a huge power imbalance at play, or if your partner simply refuses to join you in the work of repair, leaving is often justified. But then again, as someone who grew up sheltered in a similar community and naively assuming that divorce was stupid and selfish 100% of the time, I tend to think those qualifiers would do more good than harm. reply floren 1 hour agoparentIt felt pretty clear in the article that he was talking about people who were frustrated, tired, perhaps depressed, not in duress or under threat of harm.

It is possible for relationships to be damaging for one or both members. It's easy to say this the mindset of making things work doesn't apply to abusive relationships - but it's not always clear what abuse is. The very mindset that 'divorce is not an option' means that people spend far too long in dangerous situations. From my experience - I was married for 6 years to someone who, from the same starting position, moved to a very different philosophical viewpoint to me. This evolved over time, but by the end she'd happily tell me my belief system was wrong and immoral, and that she wanted she were married to someone who shared her viewpoint. She even said that in her opinion we shouldn't be married, but that she didn't believe in divorce. She'd never accept that there was anything wrong with what she was doing - she was simply trying to save me - and when I said 'I find what you're saying hurtful' she'd tell me she had no choice but to say it. I can only imagine how miserable a time she was having, but she saw no choice but to continue in that relationship. This never seemed like abuse at the time - and I'm certain she didn't mean it as such - but with hindsight she broke down my confidence in myself and in who I was and left me fundamentally doubting whether I was a good person (among other things, like making relationships with friends and family difficult). Of course, everyone's experience is unique, but when I left that relationship I felt guilty, selfish and like I'd failed. It's only with hindsight that I can say with confidence that it was the best thing for everyone involved, and I'm much happier and healthier some years and plenty of therapy later. The narrative expressed in the article means people stay in awful situations they could be well out of. We didn't have kids - and I'd definitely have been considering different things if we did (in particular, not wanting those kids to end up with a mother whose world view I fundamentally disagreed with, without my influence), but it may well still have been the right decision. reply efields 46 minutes agoparentprevThere’s always exceptions.

My father was distant and, when present, was focused on placating her. When my own marriage of 16 years ran into problems that were seemingly intractable, I finally realized I did not want similar for myself, my then-wife, or my kids. I spent several years trying to mend things, but I was the only participant. I have no regrets over leaving, it was best for everyone.

Should take a month or two, depending on what all’s involved. A month or two?! To re-do a bathroom? You say this like you're proud of it. I wouldn't. Accounting for drywall mudding and drying it should take a week, where most of the work happens in 2 days, on the weekend. Maybe you need 2 more days, the next weekend. Hell, take the other end of that weekend too. 1-2 month quotes is why I don't hire contractors, why I fix my own cars, and only use a personal friend for HVAC help. reply BanazirGalbasi 1 hour agoparentFor people new to the DIY skills it requires to do it right, 2 months seems reasonable. You have to learn the skills, and when you're applying them you stop constantly to check tutorials or look for advice. You take the entire project one step at a time and you do one part before even starting to research the next. A day of demo leaves you with an empty room with pipes sticking out of the walls. Maybe you've removed the drywall too so now you have outlet boxes and studs to work with. You take the rest of the day to finish the cleanup and triple-check your measurements for everything. Half your weekend has now been taken to demolish and clean up a core part of your home. The next day you do your framing, including buying your lumber. Again, if you're new to this, you're probably checking a tutorial or plans every 10 minutes as you go so you make sure you're doing it right. If you have time and you're confident, you can get the plumbing set up so that it's ready to drop the tub/shower and vanity in place next weekend. For someone with experience, this is an excruciatingly slow pace. For someone who is doing it for the first time and may never do it again, this is pretty reasonable. I would absolutely be proud of taking two months to do a bathroom if it means it's done right the first time. Going by the comments about contractors here, that's not a guarantee just because someone else can do it faster. reply bluGill 1 hour agoparentprevIf you are helping me do that work it will take more than 2 months - with kids and all they have to do I cannot do much work in a week.

Saturday might be free if the kids don't have an activity. If I quit my job I could get the bathroom done in a couple weeks alone, and less if I can get help for the tasks that really need two people.

I don't know you, I'm just judging what's written here. > kids activities have to go on a back burner ... I see no reason to place childrens non-needs above critical family infrastructure This comes across as pretty callous toward your children's development! Social interactions with family are needs for children, too. It sounds like you chose to go off and build a house unnecessarily and ignored the labor of raising your children to do it, which a lot of people would find pretty irresponsible. So as a rebuttal to someone else saying they can't make the time, because they have work and kids, I think it functions better as an argument against doing what you did. If buying an already-built home wasn't a realistic option for you, that would be very important context here. reply beaglesss 21 minutes agorootparentWe didn't have a home and the money I saved for a home went from being able to buy a nice house in the city to not even being able to buy a trailer in a wasteland after the COVID free interest fest. Now all those homes are locked up in rates no one will give up for less than a kings ransom. Ultimately only one option remained, buy land in a place without building codes and then build without a license. Took me awhile to find the loophole, but I executed it. I built a house for only $60k in a state where a burnt out trailer is now $150k. reply nradov 33 minutes agorootparentprevThat's an impressive accomplishment. My father did much the same, but hired professional contractors for some of the more complex parts. Children don't need to participate in extracurricular activities such as travel club sports.

I have no doubt that the bathroom would have taken similarly long. We had a similar experience with people hired to replace our windows taking two years before the lawyers got involved. Both of these were on the medium-high prices because we got burned hiring a couple of cheap folks in the past. Joke's on us. Things they both did: - Not measure things properly. How on earth a \"professional\" can be two-four inches off on several measurements I have no idea. - Not check the order before ordering it (and waiting months for it to be made and come in). - Not check the order before installing it. - Conveniently losing digital and physical copies of contracts and communications. Too bad for them we kept the signed originals. - When I mention that it's clearly not right (prior to install) we get told something along the lines of \"that's how they come from the factory, we fix it after installation\". After install we get told \"of course we can't fix that, you can accept it or wait another 6-8 months for new parts.\" - A project manager that never actually supervises anything or shows up and has no problem lying to your face then saying something completely different in email afterwards. - Contractor blaming manufacturer while manufacturer blames contractor. You have to take a day off work every time they come to inspect things yet again. That's not even mentioning the constant babysitting that needs to be done (I am no contractor but maybe connect the drain to the sink before it gets turned on?) And all the little things that you end up doing yourself anyway because at this point it's just not worth it anymore like fixing all of the drywall they broke because I can do it in an afternoon and I am tired of talking to them and tired of seeing them and it will take you two weeks to come out anyway. And we are not being picky here. It's stuff that should have been immediately obvious. Like our kitchen cabinets not having windows (we cut the windows out after install, they said). Or being three different colors (we paint them afterwards, they said). After install I find that both of those are lies and they apparently ordered the wrong cabinets and put in some other customer's cabinets on half my kitchen (one of the cabinets had over a dozen shims to make it fit properly). Three different materials (fiberboard, plywood, and solid wood). I didn't even notice that one until after install. What about the window that was inches too big, and you didn't bother to check before ripping the old one out? Now I need to have plywood on my window for 8 months while you order a replacement. Good thing I'm not in an HOA or that would have got expensive quick. Maybe caulk the windows too? Just a suggestion but idk you're the professional you probably know better than the manufacturer. My partner, child, or myself getting cut every time we wipe the windows. I don't care if it's the manufacturers fault come send somebody to sand them down and clip off the sharp bits. It's going to take 8 months for the new ones to come in. We're tired of bleeding every time we clean. Lastly if you have explosive diahrrea fucking clean the toilet afterwards, especially if it splashes all the way up the lid. You are disgusting and you do shit work. And the worst part is I never even mentioned the diahrrea to them because in the grand scheme of things it was absolutely minor. Washing dishes in the winter outside with a hose fucking sucks. And washing dishes in the tiny bathroom sink sucks. Washing dishes in a tiny bathroom sink right after someone stunk it up really sucks. At least if you do it yourself, you can take a long time and do a shot job, and take solace knowing that if you hired someone it would have been just as bad but taken longer and been more expensive. /rant.

Personally, this is why I want to see prefabs take off, even if the price is actually more expensive. When you buy a car, it is quite rare to find major defects. In houses, defect lists are so common that Brits have a term for it, snagging lists. Prefabs should be quite close to cars in terms of quality as they are manufactured in a factory under controlled conditions. People I have met that bought prefabs from high-end manufacturers confirmed this, and had a more or less trouble-free experience. In comparison, I have experienced major issues in every brand new house I have rented. I would not like to go through this experience as an actual owner as it would drive me insane. I have only met two contractors that were professional and took pride in their work. The rest were a bunch of wackos that only created chaos.

Carbon is a much more abstract problem even in the USA, since you don’t feel climate change right away like you smell black dirt gas air.

Most of the time AQI was around 50, and sometimes it got to 100. Not bad at all for us. Just a point of reference: back in 2009 we transited through Beijing to fly to HK and even just spending a few hours in the airport resulted in my daughter having to use an emergency nebulizer. This time hardly anyone had a problem. Beijing used to be dry and dusty (from what my wife tells me from visiting 30y ago) now they've pulled in a lot of water through some newer canals and the humidity is really high (mosquitos are starting to become a problem).

Core of the issue though, isn't it? The planet can't support 8 billion humans right now. This living standards of around 7.8, 7.9 billion of them are unacceptably low IMO. So if it can't support 8 billion now and it can't support 8 billion in the future, I'd like some fairly concrete explanations of why we shouldn't be promoting cheap energy and industrialisation in the here and now. It appears that industrialisation drives down population and may even lead to transhumanism, so per capita improvements to prosperity seem to be the most viable solution to our sustainability problems. I'd also bet working on cheap energy will probably drive up the carrying capacity too, that is what happened all the other times securing energy got cheaper. And as we can see in the Chinese example that we're talking about today, if we had just gone full-greed and kept building coal plants we'd probably have stumbled on a low-carbon equilibrium by accident anyway because that is more or less what seems to be happening in China. Coal and oil aren't that competitive these days.

China has a very large desert region in the northwest that receive a LOT of sun year round, so I'd expect the panels to be producing a decent amount of power throughout most of the day. The biggest problem is actually distance - even a few years back, I was reading that there was a massive amount of solar power, but a very significant percentage was lost in transmission to the most densely populated areas of China which are predominantly in the southeast and east of the country. These areas are also where a lot of rare earth metals are mined, so feasibly it would be relatively cheap to produce giga-batteries there too smooth demand, but I also suspect that they could see significant advantage to doing things that are traditionally energy-costly like electrolysis of water to create hydrogen that could be transferred across the country by pipe with pretty minimal losses and then burned to drive turbines at the other end. Such systems might end up with overall fewer losses than just having thousands of miles of power grid. Another thing I read recently that was interesting is that it's getting approximately close to free for China to produce solar panels now, significantly cheaper than anywhere else in the world. Largely this is also due to the excess power produced in the northwest that can be cheaply used in the processing needed to produce more solar panels. reply bigiain 17 hours agorootparentI dunno about that distance problem?

Hmmm now I'm curious - google google google. Refining bauxite into aluminium increases the price about 12 times from $40/ton for bauxite to about $2,700 per tone for aluminium which requires 5 tons of bauxite as an input. Australia exports about 40,000kt of bauxite a year. It requires about 15 kWh/kg to refine aluminium from bauxite. So if we refined all that bauxite into aluminium before exporting it, we'd use about 600GWh of electricity to turn $1.6 billion worth of bauxite into $220 billion worth of aluminium. (And the economics is better than that, because there's only be 8 million tons or stuff to export instead of 40 million tons.) Surely that extra 218 billion a year would be way better (for Australia) staying in our economy instead of having all that bauxite refined somewhere else? On the other hand... Sun Cable reckons it'll deliver 1.7GW to Singapore 24x7, or 15,000GWh. So refining _all_ the bauxite would only use 4% of that. Australia generates about 280TWh of electricity over a year. So refining _all_ the bauxite would use only 0.2% of that. So no. It sure as hell doesn't use \"a lot of power\", even if people do refer to aluminium as \"solid electricity\"... That was a fun rabbit hole. (Disclaimer: no effort made to verify numbers some of which were sourced directly from DuckDuckGo search response page snippets. Also, I'm notorious for dropping three orders of magnitude when doing mental math using kilo/mega/giga/tera prefixes.) reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparentRight, so it makes sense to use solar to smelt aluminum, but even if you smelt all the aluminum with solar you'd still need to transmit a ton of power from the isolated desert to the cities where people live. It's the thing where the use of electricity is a large part of the production of aluminum, but the production of aluminum is not a large part of the use of electricity. reply zik 15 hours agorootparentprevThere was a plan to make a line to South East Asia and sell power to them but I'm not sure where it's at. reply seanmcdirmid 17 hours agorootparentprevChina was investing in UHV lines a few years back to deal with the distance problem.

No Boron (in general). That dull fact alone suggests your knowledge of glass could use a significant leg up. If you're looking to better educate yourself there's the Corning School of Glass for the Art Glass applications and various industrial glass journals about optical glass, strengthened glass, et al. As for rare earths in glass you can either take the material science journal search approach (multiple hits) or refer to the uses page of the largest global supplier of rare earths: Rare earths react with other metallic and non-metallic elements to form compounds each of which has specific chemical behaviours.

Solar is cheaper and easier, so when the sun is shining you get essentially free energy while the nuclear cant be ramped down so you are now producing excess energy during the day. solar eats nuclear's lunch during the day... with the long term waste issue and military target danger of nuclear thrown in. reply Dylan16807 14 hours agorootparentNuclear can be ramped down pretty well in an engineering sense.

Nuclear is slower and more expensive to invest, build and use. there is a use for nuclear, but common widespread rollout is not it. reply pfdietz 16 hours agorootparentMaking renewables look bad? I was making nuclear look bad. Renewables don't leave any place for new nuclear for the grid. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentI still don't understand how you're expected to replace fossil fuel heating sources with solar. Peak heating demand is in winter and at night, when solar production is at its lowest. Replacing fossil fuels with nuclear can be done by you building nuclear plants, using cogeneration (steam pipes) to distribute heat to the population with reasonable distance of the plant and electricity generated by the plant to operate heat pumps for people who live more distance away. To do this reliably with solar you need enough solar generation capacity on the coldest day of the year with the least sunlight to generate an amount of power on the order of the size of the entire existing power grid, just for heating. Then you need to store the majority of it for use at night. Then you need an entirely separate backup system in case it's cloudy for too long, because if solar doesn't generate enough power then people freeze. I've heard suggestions of maintaining an entirely redundant set of traditional fossil fuel generating stations to bring online in the event of undersupply -- these things cost nearly as much by themselves as the nuclear plants. How is that combination supposed to be cheaper? Also, how is it supposed to be built in parallel when battery production capacity is already being consumed to electrify transportation and do peak shaving to allow renewable sources to replace fossil fuels in the existing grid? reply pfdietz 4 hours agorootparentRenewables, not just solar. At high latitude, wind is significant, and tends to be stronger in winter. Solar + wind can complement one another. Now, one still needs storage, including potentially weeks-long storage for Dunkelflauten, but that rarely used long period storage use case is handled by e-fuels like hydrogen (turned back to electrical power with turbines or fuel cells). Which brings us to... > these things cost nearly as much by themselves as the nuclear plants. This is completely wrong. A simple cycle turbine power plant is maybe 1/20th the capex per W of a nuclear plant; a combined cycle plant maybe 1/10th. Combustion turbines are amazing. We will also see migration of thermal energy intensive industries to lower latitude places with more sun and less seasonality. Diurnal storage of heat from PV is quite feasible. Sorry Europe, nuclear won't save you. I will also note that 2/3rds of industrial heat demand is atKey objectives of China are to: Increase share of non-fossil energy in total primary energy consumption to 15% by 2020 and to 20% by 2030.

It’s better the rest of the year and the further south you go. The other thing to remember is that production and storage capacity are cheap to expand, so the better question is how often it’s the case that it’s dark at times of peak demand long enough to exhaust the grid storage capacity. Currently, that’ll be the case but I’d bet that a decade from now it’ll be much less common. reply asdefghyk 18 hours agoprevThe problem is wind and solar are un reliable.

Suddenly all those benefits go away, because in this one particular facet of stoplight functionality, the wasteful and maintenance-heavy incandescent lamp is accidentally superior. Suddenly, when a new solution presents a new problem, all we think about is the problem. Yes, there are problems that exist with solar that don't exist with other electrical generation systems. That is not, by itself, evidence that solar will not be sufficient by itself as we solve those problems, and it's not a good reason to slow adoption of a piece of technology that is better in almost every way.

Coal plant you can intentionally put it outside the city, but not too far and where a flat road can connect them.

    "originBody": "Generating Simpson's Paradox with Z3. ← Back to Kevin's homepagePublished: 2024 August 11Last updated: 2024 August 12 I’ve been reading Pearl’s Causal Inference in Statistics, and one of the exercises poses this problem: Baseball batter A has a better batting average than his teammate B. However, someone notices that B has a better batting average than A against both right-handed and left-handed pitchers. How can this happen? The Z3 Theorem Prover is a great lil’ tool for solving these sorts of problems. The following generates an example of this situation, which is more commonly known as Simpson’s Paradox. (See also this great explanation from Robert Heaton, which I found via the HN comments about the page you’re currently reading.) ;; Player A's hits and misses against left-handed pitchers (declare-const A_L_hits Int) (declare-const A_L_misses Int) ;; and right-handed ones. (declare-const A_R_hits Int) (declare-const A_R_misses Int) ;; ditto for player B (declare-const B_L_hits Int) (declare-const B_L_misses Int) (declare-const B_R_hits Int) (declare-const B_R_misses Int) ;; All hits and miss counts must be positive (assert (< 0 A_L_hits)) (assert (< 0 A_L_misses)) (assert (< 0 A_R_hits)) (assert (< 0 A_R_misses)) (assert (< 0 B_L_hits)) (assert (< 0 B_L_misses)) (assert (< 0 B_R_hits)) (assert (< 0 B_R_misses)) ;; overall batting averages (define-const A Real (/ (+ A_L_hits A_R_hits) (+ A_L_hits A_R_hits A_L_misses A_R_misses))) (define-const B Real (/ (+ B_L_hits B_R_hits) (+ B_L_hits B_R_hits B_L_misses B_R_misses))) ;; batting averages against left and right-handed pitches (define-const A_L Real (/ A_L_hits (+ A_L_hits A_L_misses))) (define-const A_R Real (/ A_R_hits (+ A_R_hits A_R_misses))) (define-const B_L Real (/ B_L_hits (+ B_L_hits B_L_misses))) (define-const B_R Real (/ B_R_hits (+ B_R_hits B_R_misses))) ;; A has a higher overall batting average (assert (< B A)) ;; B has a better average against left-handed pitchers (assert (< A_L B_L)) ;; B has a better average against right-handed pitchers (assert (< A_R B_R)) (set-option :pp.decimal true) (check-sat) (get-model) (get-value (A A_L A_R A_L_hits A_L_misses A_R_hits A_R_misses)) (get-value (B B_L B_R B_L_hits B_L_misses B_R_hits B_R_misses)) Running Z3 against this file generates this output, showing an example satisfying our constraints: ((A 0.2352941176?) (A_L 0.4) (A_R 0.1666666666?) (A_L_hits 2) (A_L_misses 3) (A_R_hits 2) (A_R_misses 10)) ((B 0.2307692307?) (B_L 0.5) (B_R 0.1818181818?) (B_L_hits 1) (B_L_misses 1) (B_R_hits 2) (B_R_misses 9)) The batting averages in tabular form: Player Left Right Overall A 0.4 0.167 0.235 B 0.5 0.182 0.230 The key to understanding the paradox is that the players did not bat against the same set of pitchers. Player A batted against 5 lefties and 12 righties; B against 2 and 11. If you liked this, you might like Kevin’s email newsletter.

The tongue-in-cheek variant I like (which I first read about in the book referenced by TFA) is \"no correlation without causation\". In order for two things to truly co-vary (and not just by accident, or as a consequence of poor data collection/manipulation), there needs to be some causal connection between the two – although it can be quite distant. reply mjburgess 7 hours agorootparent> there needs to be some causal connection between the two Umm.. No, there doesn't... This idea features in the earlist 20th C. writings on statistics, but it's pseudoscience. If one carves up the whole history of the entire universe into all possible events, then there's likely to be a (near) infinite number of pairs of events which \"perfectly\" co-vary without any causal connection whatsoever. Indeed, one could find two galaxies that are necessarily causally isolated and find correlated events. This is, in part, because the properties of two casually independent systems can have indistinguishable distributions -- just by the nature of what a distribution is. It's this sort of thinking that I was aiming to rule out: really they have nothing to do with each other. It's early 20th C. frequentist pseudoscience that has given birth to this supposed connection, and it should be thrown out all together. Causation is a property of natural systems. Correlation is a property of two distributions. These have nothing to do with each other. If you want to \"test\" for causation, you need to have a causal theory and a causal analysis in which \"correlation\" shouldn't feature. If you induce correlation by causal intervention, i'd prefer we gave that a different name (\"induced correlation\") which is relevant to causation -- and it's mostly this confusion which those early eugenticists that created statistics were talking about. reply kqr 1 hour agorootparent> If one carves up the whole history of the entire universe into all possible events, then there's likely to be a (near) infinite number of pairs of events which \"perfectly\" co-vary without any causal connection whatsoever.

You should look at the finest level of granularity available, and pick the best treatment in the relevant subpopulation for the patient. reply jefftk 16 hours agorootparentUnfortunately our level of certainty generally falls off as we increase the granularity. For example, imagine the patient is a 77yo Polish-American man, and we're lucky enough to have one historical result for 77yo Polish-American men. That man got treatment A and did better than expected. But say if we go out to 70-79y white men we have 1,000 people, of which 500 got treatment A and generally did significantly worse than the 500 who got treatment B.

Fisher argued to the contrary, that we should (systematically) try as many variations as possible simultaneously. Simpson's paradox (and perhaps the similarly counter-intuitive Berkson's paradox) are the reason why: when analysing just one variate at a time, we risk seeing relationships that aren't there, or run counter to what we are trying. Proper multifactor analysis that accounts for all variations simultaneously is required to learn about complex phenomena. reply staplung 16 hours agoprevSimpson's Paradox keeps experimenters up at night because it embodies the idea that although your data might say one thing, it's always possible that slicing the data via some unknown axis of finer granularity might paint a very different picture. It's hard to know if there is such an axis lurking there in your data, let alone, what it might be. If you get paranoid about its presence it can lead you to second guess pretty much every statistic. \"I know that 4 out of 5 dentists recommend chewing X Brand gum but what if I slice the dentists by number of eyes? Maybe both one-eyed dentists and two-eyed dentists aren't so enthusiastic.\" reply grobbyy 14 hours agoparentIt does, but only experiments who don't have a strong grounding in research methods. Simpson's paradox is part of a broader problem: correlation does not imply causation. In practice, it's one of many problems with making decisions based on correlations. In a randomized control trial, with a large random sample, the odds of Simpson's Paradox coming up are astronomically low. Good statisticians WILL second-guess ANY conclusions based on post-hoc data analysis. To frame this in scientific jargon, exploratory data analysis and correlations are great at generating hypotheses, but those need to be confirmed with methods appropriate for confirmatory analysis. reply tombert 19 hours agoprevZ3 is kind of my new favorite thing right now.

Isn't it possible that you have 0 hits or misses? I mean, what if your season is short and you only face a couple of lefty pitchers and strike out both times? In any case, I would explain the paradox differently than the author. The author says: \"The key to understanding the paradox is that the players did not bat against the same set of pitchers. A batted against 5 lefties and 12 righties; B against 2 and 11.\" I would say instead that the key to understanding the paradox is to observe that both players are much better when batting against lefties and that player A batted against lefties much more often, both in absolute and relative terms. In other words, A is not as good against lefties as B but he faced a lot more of these comparatively easy pitchers. reply cortesoft 15 hours agoparentThat would be possible for a hitter, but it would be impossible to be an example of Simpson's paradox in that case. reply cubefox 7 hours agoprevA basic question I always had about Simpson's paradox: If X is positively correlated with Y, but X is also negatively correlated with its parts when Y is broken down (Simpson's paradox) – is it then more likely that X causes Y or that X causes not-Y? This seems to be a pretty fundamental question but I have never seen it addressed. reply taeric 3 hours agoparentMy understanding is that the answer is more that there are more important/causal elements than X acting on Y. That is it. For the college admissions example, the more important factor was what department you applied to. That had far more of a meaningful contribution to whether you were admitted than what your sex was. So, if folks wanted to increase admissions, you wouldn't focus on sex, you would focus on expanding departments. That is the general trend with all of the examples.

Full details here: https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-new This is a new service that we're experimenting with that uses PGLite[0], a WASM build of Postgres that runs in the browser. You might remember an earlier WASM build[1] that was around ~30MB. The Electric team [2] have gone one step further and created a complete build of Postgres that’s under 3MB. Their implementation is technically interesting. Postgres is normally multi-process - each client connection is handed to a child process by the postmaster process. In WASM there’s limited/no support for process forking and threads. Fortunately, Postgres has a relatively unknown built-in “single user mode” [3] primarily designed for bootstrapping a new database and disaster recovery. Single-user mode only supports a minimal cancel REPL, so PGlite adds wire-protocol support which enables parametrised queries etc. We have created https://postgres.new as an experiment. You can think of it like a love-child between Postgres and ChatGPT: in-browser Postgres sandbox with AI assistance. You can spin up as many new Postgres databases as you want because they all live inside your browser. We pair PGlite with an LLM (currently GPT-4o) and give it full reign over the database with unrestricted permissions. This is an important detail - giving an LLM full autonomy means that it can run multiple operations back-to-back: any SQL errors from Postgres are fed back to the language model so that it can have a few more attempts to solve the problem. Since it’s in-browser it’s low risk. Some other features include: - CSV upload: you can upload a CSV and it will automatically create a Postgres table which you can query with natural language. - Charts: you can ask the LLM to create a chart with the data and change the colors of the charts. - RAG / pgvector: PGLite supports pgvector, so you can ask the LLM to create embeddings for RAG. The site uses transformers.js [4] to create embeddings inside the browser. We’re working on an update to deploy your databases and serve them from S3 using pg-gateway [5]. We expect to have a read-only deployments ready by the end of the week. You can access them using any postgres-compatible tool (eg: psql). Everything is open source.

The reason it is also memory bound is because Emscripten's IndexedDB VFS is actually implemented as an in-memory VFS which syncs files to IndexedDB every once in awhile (due to an async limitation).

    "originBody": "PC Components CPUs AMD records its highest server market share in decades — Intel fights back in client PCs News By Anton Shilov published 7 hours ago Another strong quarter for AMD. Comments (4) When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. AMD enjoyed another great quarter in Q2 2024 as it gained share in data center and laptop CPU markets, according to a new report from CPU market tracker Mercury Research. Still, Intel gained share in desktops and continues to lead in terms of units in general. (Image credit: AMD/Mercury Research) Intel continued to dominate the client PC market in the second quarter of 2024, securing a 78.9% market share, while AMD held 21.1%. This outcome is expected, considering the strength and variety of Intel's client product lineup. Still, AMD managed to increase its unit share by 0.5% sequentially and by 3.8% year-over-year. Despite AMD's ongoing success, it will likely take the company years to achieve the sales growth needed to fully shift the market in its favor, not only because Intel dominates corporate PC sales but also because of Intel's access to vast production capacity.

Considering that AMD was preparing to release its all-new Zen 5-based CPUs for desktops in August, we doubt the company was too aggressive with stuffing the channel with its previous-generation Zen 4-based offerings, which might be one of the reasons why the company lost a small chunk of the market to its rival. Then again, when compared to the second quarter of 2023, AMD gained a 3.6% share in Q2 2024, which is quite a good result.

The company commanded 20.3% of x86 processors for laptops in Q2 2024: this is 1% higher than in the first quarter of this year and 3.8% higher than in the same quarter a year ago. Apparently, even the upcoming launch of Zen 5-based Ryzen AI and Copilot+ and the AI PC frenzy are not expected to lower demand for AMD's existing offerings for notebooks, which is why PC makers accelerated purchases of these products. Another reason for AMD's success could be Intel's issues with supplying enough Meteor Lake PCs. Still, AMD does not seem to have sold many expensive ('expensive' does not mean highest-end, though) Ryzen CPUs. Its laptop CPU revenue share is 17.7%, which is well below its 20.3% unit market share. Again, AMD's position improved as it increased its revenue share by 2.8% compared to the second quarter of this year and by a rather noticeable 4.5% compared to the second quarter of 2023.

The company has managed to capture another 0.5% share away from Intel and now controls 24.1% of the data center CPU market with its EPYC CPUs. When compared to the second quarter of 2024, AMD's gain looks even more impressive, as the company grabbed 5.6% from Intel. Although Intel is an indisputable leader when it comes to volumes, as it still controlled some 75.9% of datacenter CPU shipments in the second quarter, it is necessary to note that AMD seems to lead in high-end crème-de-la-crème machines that require the most powerful and expensive processors, as we can conclude from the financial results of the two companies in Q2 2024. While Intel earned $3.0 billion selling 75.9% of data center CPUs (in terms of units), AMD earned $2.8 billion selling 24.1% of server CPUs (in terms of units), which signals that the average selling price of an AMD EPYC is considerably higher than the ASP of an Intel Xeon.

Indeed, AMD's revenue share of the server market in Q2 2024 was 33.7%, as calculated by AMD itself based on data from Mercury Research. That is up 0.7% QoQ and 6.6% YoY, an impressive result. Then again, Intel has nothing to offer against AMD's 96-core and 128-core processors for now, so AMD controls the market for high-end servers.

I recommended that we buy an AMD machine primarily because of the current intel issues. The first problem I ran into is that the majority of companies selling pre-built computers do not offer an AMD option (and pre-built is a must. We are not allowed to use grant money to buy all the parts and assemble ourselves, which would have been my preferred option). And when they do, they are often limited in selection and might only be older generation or budget-tier CPUs. I did eventually manage to find an AMD option that fit our needs and my boss forwarded to billing for approval. We got significant push back with IT recommending various intel machines that they claimed were \"better\" (although also several hundred dollars more expensive), but were also available through the universities preferred sales partners. We could probably fight and get them to allow us to purchase what we want (the fact that they have to \"allow\" it when 100% of our funding is non-university dollars is a separate, ridiculous issue), but honestly, at this point we have probably already spent more staff time on this than the real world differences, even including the micro-code problems, are worth. I'd bet that a lot of corporate contexts, and even home enthusiast customers, operate on the same momentum: they have always bought intel and so they will continue to buy intel. Even in the absence of some strong belief that intel is \"better\". reply etempleton 11 minutes agorootparentI think there is a lot of trust of Intel. It is the only processor company most people know. For IT departments I think a lot of it is that they want you to have processors they know work with their software stack. In addition, Intel has their own software stack that works with their processors that include features such as Remote Desktop and security.

If you're thinking recent as in the last few years, then because the performance and power issues with Intel aren't large enough to make any difference for regular desktop use. Most will be on a 3 - 5 year upgrade cycle, so your new office PC just needs to be better than a five year old one, which it will be. What it might do it damage the used market.

MKL, OpenAPI, Intel Optimization for sklearn, for pytorch, etc (there are many more). No equivilants exist from AMD but NVIDIA has an equivalent for all of these (i.e. CuPy). Using AMD for AI stuff only makes sense if you never believe that you may want to do any kind of ML-like workload on or with the CPUs assistance. This is true for many folks though, but for those it's not true for, they will buy blue until Intel no longer exists. reply treprinum 1 hour agorootparentMKL runs on Ryzens just fine and newest Ryzens all have AVX512 which all new desktop/laptop Intels lack. \"AI\" on CPU is a gimmick, everybody does it on GPU anyway (outside 128GB RAM M3 Max that has some LLM use, but it's still due to shared memory with GPU). reply Der_Einzige 1 hour agorootparentCertain workloads aren't total \"gimmicks\" (i.e. small embeddings models), and often those CPU optimizations are on things that absolutely do take advantage of the CPU well (i.e. graph analysis) or on traditional ML algorithms like random forests (intel optimizations for sklearn) which are still important and do still run well on CPUs. Not to mention that most people have more RAM than they do VRAM. Running MKL on your datacenter grade AMD processor technically violates some license and it relies tricks like this - https://danieldk.eu/Posts/2020-08-31-MKL-Zen Technically, if your found to be allowing this as a cloud provider by Intel, they have grounds to sue you, so yes, you can use MKL on a Ryzen at home, but you put yourself at risk for lawsuits by doing this in a data center at scale reply mdasen 1 hour agoparentprevHonestly, this is one of the reasons I think Intel's stock is likely undervalued at this point (not that I want to invest my money with management I don't feel confident in). Intel is facing a lot of threats and they rested on their laurels. At the same time, Intel is still 75-80% of the market - even as AMD started killing Intel in performance for several years. I'm less sure that Intel will hit its fab milestones than Intel's press releases, but I'm also not sure that AMD can really take advantage of that. AMD is reliant on TSMC's capacity and as we've seen recently, AMD often has to wait a year or two before it can use TSMC's latest processes. Even AMD's upcoming Zen 5 processors will be using TSMC's 4nm N4P process (with future Zen 5 processors expected to be 3nm). If Intel is able to get 18A out the door in 2025, Intel's fabrication will certainly be competitive with what AMD can get (and likely quite a bit better). From what I've read (and I might be wrong), it sounds like Intel is moving to High NA EUV soon (now-ish/2025) while TSMC is waiting until around 2030 (https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/manufacturing/tsm...). Is TSMC falling into the trap of letting a competitor out-invest them - the same trap that Intel fell into ~2012-2022? Probably not, but it does seem likely that the advantage TSMC had will taper away over the next couple years - assuming Intel isn't full of crap about their progress. Even if TSMC maintains a lead against Intel, can AMD take marketshare? Specifically, can AMD produce as many chips as demanded or are they somewhat limited by how much capacity they can get from TSMC? For example, if people want X number of AMD server chips, does AMD manufacture 25% of that number and 75% of customers buy Intel chips because that's what is available due to AMD's lack of fab capacity? I'm not saying that is the case - it's a genuine question for someone that knows more about the industry than I do. We do know that TSMC has limited capacity. Apple tied up TSMC's 3nm capacity such Apple is the only company shipping 3nm parts. It looks like Intel will be the next company shipping 3nm parts with their Lunar Lake using TSMC's N3B process this fall. I'd also note that Intel's fabs aren't unlimited either. Meteor Lake moved to Intel 4 in December 2023, but Emerald Rapids (server) remained on Intel 7 at the same time. Intel can't just churn out as many Intel 4 chips as they'd like. I too wonder how/why AMD is still below 25% marketshare given Intel's issues. I wonder if AMD has limitations on how much fab capacity it can get which is stifling attempts at gaining marketshare. At the same time, it looks like Intel is on a course to fix its issues - if one can believe what Intel is saying. If Intel is able to ship 18A chips in 2025 at volume, it seems like it should fix the big issue that Intel has been facing - inferior fabs. AMD has been able to out-do Intel in part because it's been able to rely on TSMC's better fabrication. Is this just a blip where Intel looks bad 2020-2024? That's a genuine question because I don't really know enough about the industry. Maybe someone will say that Intel's PR is mostly bluster and that they're still being run by beancounters trying to optimize for short-term profits. Maybe someone will say that Intel is investing in the right direction, but there's still a lot of risk around pulling off High NA EUV for 2025. Maybe someone will say that Intel is likely to hit their milestones and will regain the title of best-fab. However, given that AMD hasn't been able to really hammer Intel's marketshare, it feels like Intel has more staying power than I'd think. Again, like the parent comment, it's always puzzled me that AMD hasn't gained a ton of marketshare over the past 5 years. reply treprinum 1 hour agorootparentAll these points about Intel are just waiting for an answer to \"Is Intel capable of changing its prevailing culture or not?\". There is a reason why Intel fell behind and it wasn't due to a lack of engineering geniuses inside. You might bet on the stock market and see. AMD obviously has a SPOF in TSMC and its limited capacity. reply jeffbee 3 hours agoparentprevIntel sells a complete package with highly integrated laptop things such as wifi (CNVio2) and webcam (IPU6) for a very low price, and they have things that fleet buyers want like vPRO. reply treprinum 2 hours agorootparentThe article had a separate \"mobile\" category for that where AMD hadStill wondering how AMD has only ~25% of desktop market share given recent Intel issues.

Actually, is there today (or since 1 or 2 years) any reason to go with Intel on desktop or server? reply foobiekr 2 hours agoparentStrategically, in global terms from a US-centric point of view, it would be very good if Intel could recover, as having the entire world reliant on TSMC would be bad for everyone. Also there really isn't any other org like Intel at the moment in the broader sense in a few ways (mostly advanced research). That said, Intel really has nothing to fall back on. Internally, it is very much like many of the other big companies - run by executive whim papered over with justifications that are tissue thin. There are a lot of companies like this - Cisco, Intel, whatever the hell is left of IBM, Nokia, Lattice, NetApp, etc. - that will probably die this decade if they fail to reboot their executive and managerial cultures. I have a lot of friends who have been in the great parts of Intel (the CPU design teams and, believe it or not, fabrication) and the crap parts (everything else, especially networking and storage [what's left of it], except maybe the perenially suffering ICC team). Pat has failed to make things materially better because the system that is the body of Intel is resilient to disruptions of the sort he is trying. A massive replacement and flattening of culture is required there and he has not been able to execute on it. Turnover is coming for all the companies I list above. If I had to go out on a limb and suggest a longterm survivor from the list above, it might be Lattice. Otherwise everyone listed is driving hard straight to the ground internally, whether the market sees it or not. reply Miraste 2 hours agorootparentIBM has been heading toward the ground for thirty years, and they never seem to hit it. Whatever problems they have, they are both diversified and deeply entrenched in all kinds of government and S&P 500 systems and processes, to the point that their performance barely matters. Intel doesn't have anything like that to paper over their deficiencies. reply robotnikman 28 minutes agorootparentPlenty of places still running AS/400 on crazy high support contracts, and no plans of moving on. reply etempleton 3 hours agoparentprevFor some specific workloads. Many people in the Plex community will point to Quicksync as being superior for media encoding than anything that AMD offers. The next couple of years will be interesting. If Intel can pull off 18a they will very likely retake the lead, however if 18a underwhelms Intel will be in real trouble. There is also the possibility that AMD chooses Intel as a fab in the future, which would feel a bit like when Sonic showed up on a Nintendo console (for some reason it just feels wrong). reply darknavi 28 minutes agorootparentI was going to say Quicksync. I just spec'd and bought a new server build and the igpus on a few year old Intel chips is hard to beat for price and tdp. reply ISV_Damocles 3 hours agoparentprevI personally only use AMD (excepting one test machine), but Intel does have the best single-thread performance[1] so if you have some crufty code that you can't parallelize in any way, it'll work best with Intel. [1]: https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-hierarchy,4312.html... reply adrian_b 2 hours agorootparentThe new Zen 5 has a much better single-thread performance than any available Intel CPU. For instance a slow 5.5 GHz Zen 5 matches or exceeds a 6.0 GHz Raptor Lake in single-thread performance. The faster Zen 5 models, which will be launched in a couple of days, will beat easily any Intel. Nevertheless, in a couple of months Intel will launch Arrow Lake S, which will have a very close single-thread performance to Zen 5, perhaps very slightly higher. Because Arrow Lake S will be completely made by TSMC, it will have a much better energy efficiency than the older Intel CPUs and also than AMD Zen 5, because it will use a superior TSMC \"3 nm\" process. On the other hand, it is expected to have the same maximum clock frequency as AMD Zen 5, so its single thread performance will no longer be helped by a higher clock frequency, like in Raptor Lake. reply listic 1 hour agorootparent> in a couple of months Intel will launch Arrow Lake S, which will have a very close single-thread performance to Zen 5 Will they?

[2] https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-says-raptor-lake-microcode... reply adrian_b 1 hour agorootparentThe Intel Innovation event was canceled to save money. This has nothing to do with the actual launch of future products, which are expected to bring more money. Intel can make a cheap on-line product launch, like most such launches after COVID. Since the chips of Arrow Lake S are made at TSMC and Intel does only packaging and testing, like also for Lunar Lake, there will be no manufacturing problems. The only thing that could delay the Arrow Lake S launch would be a bug so severe that it would require a new set of masks. For now there is no information about something like this. reply Rohansi 3 hours agorootparentprevUnless your workloads are not very cache optimized like most games, then AMD's 3D V-cache CPUs take the lead. reply treprinum 3 hours agoparentprevN100 & N305 have no competition in their own space IMO. For the rest I don't see any advantage outside momentum and \"nobody is going to be fired for using IBM\" approach. reply epolanski 3 hours agoparentprevI think Intel still takes the crown when it comes to maximizing every single fps. Also, for a while, it was more competitive in the mid range than AMD's equivalent from a price/performance point of view. reply tracker1 1 hour agorootparentThis is where I think AMD really messed up on the current releases... If they'd called the 9600X a 9400 and the 9700X a 9600X, and charged like $100 less, I think the reception would have been much stronger. As it stands, it's more about wait and see. You can use PBO and get like 10-15% more performance at double the energy, but even then compared to the rest of the market, it just comes up short. The 9800X3D and 9950X(3D) options will really carry this cycle if they're good and the pricing adapts appropriately. I'm not holding my breath. I've been holding on with my 5950X since it's release and likely going to continue unless the 9950X(3D) is compelling enough. Not to mention the DDR5 memory issues with larger sizes or more sticks. 96gb is probably enough, but at what cost. reply adrian_b 5 minutes agorootparentThe 9600X and 9700X are not a useful upgrade for gamers, but they are excellent for anyone else. Their energy efficiency is much better that for any previous x86 CPUs and for those who use applications that benefit from AVX-512 the desktop Zen 5 brings an increase in throughput higher than for any new CPU of the last five years (the last time when a desktop CPU had a double throughput over its predecessors was in 2019, with Zen 2 over Coffee Lake Refresh). Also in the applications like Web browsers or MS Office, which prefer single-thread performance, they beat even the top Raptor Lake Refresh of 6.0 GHz, which is much more expensive and it consumes a power several times greater. Moreover, as shown by TechPowerUp, the performance of Zen 5 under Windows is suboptimal in comparison with Intel in the programs that use a small number of active threads, like the games, because the Windows scheduler uses a policy that favors power savings over performance, even if that is a bad choice for a desktop CPU. That means that the scheduler prefers to make both threads of a core active, while keeping idle the other cores, even if the right policy (which is used on Intel) is to begin to use the second threads of the cores only after all the cores have one active thread. This should be easy to correct in the Windows scheduler. reply tracker1 3 minutes agorootparentI think it would depend on the cost of electricity.. as the performance for most is similar to the prior gen, which costs significantly less. reply wmf 2 hours agoparentprevIntel could come back once all their chips are on 3 nm later this year. reply llm_nerd 2 hours agoparentprevAt some price points and for some scenarios, or if a particular pre-built has everything you need for the right price and happens to have Intel, sure there are plenty of situations where Intel is the right choice. It is amazing to see how Intel has faltered. This was all laid in stone a decade ago when Intel was under delusions that its biggest competitor was itself, and the only thing it cared about was ensuring that their lower power and lower cost devices didn't compete with their cash-cow high end products. They optimized for the present and destroyed their future. reply foobarian 43 minutes agoprevWait a little more and maybe we won't need to add more choices to AWS amd64 or arm64! :-) reply albertopv 1 hour agoprevSoon migrating part of DC to Oracle Cloud (don't ask...), a consultancy firm will do the job, all VM will be on AMD CPUs. reply scrapcode 3 hours agoprevIs there any indication at all that this is due to businesses bringing their hardware back on-prem? Do you think \"history repeats itself\" will hold true in the on-prem v. cloud realm? reply keyringlight 2 hours agoparentOne thing I wonder about is whether it's the long term effects of things like spectre/meltdown coming home to roost. I can only speculate as I'm not in the server industry, but IIRC with the mitigations that reduced performance intel benefited a lot with companies buying more servers to make up the shortfall while AMD Zen was still proving itself to what seems like a conservative market. Has the \"no one ever got fired for buying X\" reputation shifted? reply jeffbee 3 hours agoparentprevWhy do you believe that could be a related phenomenon? How much server market is going to non-cloud vs. cloud? Some analysts estimate the global server market last year at $95 to $150 billion. AWS spent $48 billion on capital last year. Google bought $32 billion in capital, most of which is \"on-prem\" from their perspective. A switch in the machine-of-the-day from Intel to AMD at one of these large buyers could easily cause the slight change in market share mentioned in the article. Overall I think a lot of people continue to underestimate the size of the heavy hitters on the buy side of the server market. reply scrapcode 55 minutes agorootparentWhy wouldn't it be a viable reason? Every customer that AWS and Google have has the potential to make that decision and I believe it gets more appetizing with every data breach / funnel failure / etc. reply jeffbee 36 minutes agorootparentEvery indicator we have is that movement to the cloud is a massive tidal wave, and all we have on the retreat to on-prem is a handful of anecdotes and vibes. It's really up to the proponent of such an argument to provide some evidence for the extraordinary claim that return to on-prem is signifiant enough to influence server market share (or even establish that such revanchists would prefer AMD more than cloud buyers do). reply wongarsu 3 hours agoparentprevAnecdotally it seems like the rose-tinted glasses are coming off in terms of the amount of money and work saved by moving towards the cloud. Of course those aren't the only reasons to move to the cloud. But a lot of companies moved to the cloud due to promises and expectations that didn't pan out, so at least some of them moving back is only natural. Especially with many new solutions around private cloud and serverless allowing them to bring the \"good parts\" of the cloud to hardware they own or rent. That's just the normal hype cycle playing out. reply cletus 1 hour agoprevIt's hard to believe it's been roughly two decades since the Athlon/Opteron almost killed Intel, which would've been the last time AMD did so well in server market share. The short version of this story is that Intel licensed the x86 instruction set back in the 90s to several companies including AMD and Cyrix. Intel didn't like this as time went on. First, they couldn't trademark numbers, which is why the 486 went to the Pentium. Second, they didn't want developers producing compatible chips. So Intel entered into a demonic pact with HP to develop EPIC. That's the architecture name. Itanium was the cip. Merced was one of the early code names. This was in the 90s when it wasn't clear if RISC or CISC would dominate. As we now know, this effort was years last, with huge cost overruns and by the time it shipped it was too expensive for too little performance. At the same time, on the consumer front we had the Megahertz Wars. Intel moved from the Pentium-3 to the Pentium-4 that scaled really well with clock speed but wasn't great with IPC. It also had issues with pipelines and failed branch prediction (IIRC). But from a marketing perspective it killed AMD (and Cyrix). Why is this important? Because 64 bit was around the corner and Intel wanted to move the market to EPIC. AMD said to hell with that and released the x84-64 instruction set (which, by the terms of the licensing agreemnt, Intel had a right to use as well) and released the Athlon series of desktop chips, followed later by the Opteron server chips. These were wildly successful. The Pentium-4 hit a clock ceiling of 3-4 GHz, which still pretty much exists today. In the 90s it was thought chips would scale up to 10GHz or beyond by many. What saved Intel? The Pentium-3. You see the Pentium-3 had morphed into a mobile platform because it was very energy efficient. First as Pentium-M and later as Core Duo and Core 2 Duo. This was the Centrino platform. Some early hackers took Centrino boards and built desktops. The parts were hard to get if you weren't a laptop OEM. They probably salvaged laptops. Anyway by the mid to late 2000s, Intel had fully embraced this and it became the Core architecture that has evolved largely ever since to what we have today. But back then Intel was formidable in terms of bringing new smaller processes online. This was a core competency right up until the 10nm transition in the 2010s, which was years late. And TSMC (and even Samsung) came along and ate their lunch. I can't tell you that happened but Intel never recovered, to this day. As for AMD, after a few years they never seemed to capitalize on their Opteron head start. Maybe it was that Intel caught up. I'm not really sure. But they were in the wilderness for probably 10-15 years, right up until Ryzen. Intel needs to be studied for how badly they dropped the bag. Nowadays, their CEO seems to be reduced to quoting the Bible on Twitter [1]. I'm glad to see AMD back. I still believe ARM is going to be a huge player in the coming decade.

I've actually built a small tool that has the UX of regular SSH but under the hood reboots into rescue, configures the keys and opens an SSH session. Once you close it, it reboots back into regular mode. I've wrapped that tool again to then build a tool that takes just an ignition config and automatically images a hetzner server with fedora coreos using that config. You could easily build your own tool that reboots into rescue, installs a VM, mounts all the necessary devices, boots the OS image, and exposes the serial console of that VM to you. It took me a while to learn to love Hetzner's solution, but I prefer it over having to use shitty proprietary KVMs. reply ninjin 10 hours agoparentprevWell, an alternative approach for their bare metal boxes is to request a KVM and link whatever image you in the KVM request form. They will then download it, put it into a USB stick, and plug in the KVM and USB stick. In my experience, you will have it all set up within the hour. This is of course easier (although the KVM software is a heap of proprietary arse with a web interface or ancient Java blob), but if you are truly paranoid you will have to trust the Hetzner staff and their software stack not to bring something undesired along with your provided image. reply chocolatkey 9 hours agorootparentJust a sidenote, in my experience, over the part year or so, Hetzner has finally switched to more modern KVMs with good HTML5 consoles. The Java applet was indeed a pain. reply clan 8 hours agorootparentprevI know as well that they are often impressively quick to respond. But it is not the initial setup I am really worried about. It is those fan meet fecies moments. Being able to respond to a situation instantly. Mfsbsd was a godsend. Trying to fix problems on one OSis from a different OS is a much harder issue. Especially under pressure. I would much rather have seen they added OpenBSD to their PXE environment. Just the vanilla stuff - no fancy optimizations. reply wongarsu 4 hours agoparentprevTo be fair, it's only that hard because the author wanted to do it without KVM. As they note getting KVM access for a Hetzner server is only a short message to support away. Last time I requested it (to change BIOS settings) I got it within 5 minutes. reply daneel_w 8 hours agoprevThis seems unusually complicated. With Hetzner's infra you should be able to just boot the install kernel (\"miniroot\") and proceed from there with a normal networked installation via their serial console.

There is little magic. Boot linux rescue system. Fire qemu. Go with auto-install. Even with raid setup if you want to. Done.

It seems that setting up a physical server with OpenBSD is much more complicated, though. reply daneel_w 3 hours agoparentIt's not particularly complicated. You boot into the rescue system and from there \"dd\" the OpenBSD install kernel to the host's boot disk.

We tested the ability of 152 astrologers to see if they could demonstrate genuine astrological skill. Here is how the study was designed and what we found (including a result that really surprised me): 🧵 Back in January, we ran a study trying to predict 37 facts about people's lives using their astrological sun signs (whether they are Pisces, Aries, etc.) While personality tests were able to predict these facts decently well, sun signs couldn't predict even a single 1 of them... Some astrologers criticized us for this, saying that sun signs/zodiac signs are just tabloid astrology - real astrologers use a person's entire astrological chart. And they're right! Taking into account this criticism, we got the help of 6 astrologers to design a new study. Here's how the study worked to test astrologers: • in each round, each astrologer gets LOTS of information about a real person (answers to 43 questions) along with 5 full astrological charts • they then predict which is the person's real natal chart (the other 4 are decoys) Why this study design? One of the most fundamental claims of astrology is that a person's natal chart contains information about that person's life and character. If true, astrologers should be able to correctly choose a person's chart at a rate well above random guessing. Each astrologer tries to match people to their correct chart 12 times. If they're guessing completely at random (e.g., they have no skill because astrology doesn't actually work), then they'll get about 20% of questions right, or about 2.4 questions right (on average) out of 12. Neat aspects of this study design are that (1) if astrology doesn't work, it's impossible for astrologers to do better than random guessing at this task, while (2) for the study to come out in support of astrology, astrologers only need to do slightly better than random guessing But this is only a fair test if astrologers believe they can do this task - so we limit our analyses only to participants with prior astrological experience who predicted they would do better than random guessing at the task. Our results are based on 152 such astrologers. These astrologers were quite confident in their ability to match people to charts. Those with the least experience believed (after they had completed participation) that they'd gotten 5 out of 12 right, and those with the most experience thought they'd gotten 10 out of 12 right. So, how did astrologers do overall? If they'd gotten even 23% of questions right (slightly above the 20% of random guessing), the study would have come out in favor of astrology. But astrologers as a group performed indistinguishable from random guessing, getting < 21% right. We can compare how frequently astrologers got different numbers of questions correct to how often we'd expect them to get different numbers correct if they were all guessing totally at random with no skill. The two distributions match very closely. But perhaps the less experienced astrologers were just dragging down the performance of the group? We looked at how performance varied based on astrological experience. More experienced astrologers did not do better than less experienced ones despite being far more confident. Even if most astrologers have no skill, there's another way astrology could prove itself. If even 1 of the 152 astrologers performed exceptionally well, that could provide meaningful evidence for astrology. We offered a $1000 prize for anyone getting at least 11 out of 12. Unfortunately, despite more than half of the astrologers believing that they had gotten 6 or more questions right (after completing the task), in actual fact, not a single astrologer got more than 5 right. Okay, so despite them believing they could do this task, astrologers seemed to have no ability to match people to their astrological charts. But, even if they aren't getting the answers right, do they at least agree with each other on what the right answers are? Much to my surprise, astrologers had very low agreement with each other on the chart for each person. If astrologers picked charts at random, they would agree with each other 20% of the time. In our study, even the most experienced astrologers only agreed 28% of the time. In conclusion, despite believing they could do it, the 152 astrologers seemed to lack any ability to match people to their astrological charts.

More from @SpencrGreenberg Spencer Greenberg 🔍 @SpencrGreenberg Jul 8 There’s a really interesting debate raging in the field of genetics about how heritable different human traits are. It could end up overturning 100 years of research: 🧵 First off, what is heritability? It’s the fraction of the variance of a trait (in a particular population) that’s caused by genetic differences. Everyone agrees that height is at least fairly heritable since, in most populations, much of the variation is attributable to genes. A classical and very commonly used way to estimate the heritability of a trait is to compare how similar that trait is among identical twins relative to how similar it is among fraternal (non-identical but same-sex) twins. The logic is that… Read 17 tweets Spencer Greenberg 🔍 @SpencrGreenberg Jun 22 Are there false memories that many people share (i.e., a \"Mandela Effect\")?

(2 of 6) Which one is the real Curious George?

[heritability megathread] 🧵 We all know that some things are determined by our genetics (nature) and some by our environment (e.g., nurture). But most things are somewhere in between. Where do things like physical health, mental health, and personality fall on this spectrum from nature to nurture? I thought it would be easy to find a comprehensive list of heritabilities somewhere, but I couldn't find one. So, I looked at lots of papers. Before we explore the results, it's important to understand a few things about what heritability means. Read 17 tweets Spencer Greenberg 🔍 @SpencrGreenberg May 29 Important but often overlooked: when groups differ a small amount in their means, they may differ *dramatically* in their tails. For instance, in a personality study, we found males to have a little bit lower average compassion score than females (1.4 vs. 2) [tails thread] 🧵 Small differences like this in averages are typically not noticeable or important. Most people are not in the tails. If you knew only someone's compassion level and had to guess their sex from it, you'd be wrong more than one-third of the time (predicting optimally)! However, small differences in means can lead to much bigger differences in the tails. Among just the most compassionate people in our study, there were about 2x more females than males (right side of the chart). Moreover, the least compassionate people were almost all males! Read 9 tweets Spencer Greenberg 🔍 @SpencrGreenberg May 28 Sometimes, groups are genuinely found to differ a bit, on average. For instance, it may be found that men are a bit more dishonest than women or that Chinese kids outperform Americans at math. At this point, people tend to go off the rails in one of 2 ways: 🧵 Group 1: Oversimplifiers. These are people who greatly exaggerate the difference. They ignore that the gap is (i) small and (ii) only a difference in averages (not applying to all individuals). They go around saying it's proven that \"X's are like this\" (e.g., men are liars). Frequently (but not always), Oversimplifiers adopt this narrative because the idea that there is a big chasm on this trait between these groups fits and reinforces their preconceived worldview (e.g., that men are bad or that the American education system sucks).

It is entirely plausible that babies born during the Summer months share something in common, and babies born during Winter months share something else. Since astrological signs are 100% correlated with the seasons, one could \"guess\" with a higher probability than random chance these traits. The causality would obviously not be from stars to babies, but from seasons to babies, but an observational study could end up \"proving\" that astrology works by identifying these \"predictions\". reply andrewla 4 hours agorootparentThis study was a followup to one that just used signs [1], which yielded performance no better than chance. If the summer/winter correlation held, then that study would have shown positive results, which it did not. There's nothing to say that these star charts or seasons of birth cannot correlate with personality traits or life outcomes. But Astrology, as a practice, is not useful for unwinding those correlations. If you have some alternate system, feel free to propose it -- pump the star charts and personality charts from this study into some AI and see if it can come up with some kind of super-astrology, and then try to replicate it.

I would expect some small differences be found due to these impacts, but they would not be universally applicable without generalization. If schools roll over to the next grade at the start of October, babies born in October will perform better due to being the oldest in their class, but this would not be universal. What I would expect to be universal, is given a school system that does grade division in this way, students right after the division would do better than the ones born right before, as the first group is the oldest in their class and the second group is the youngest. The extent this pairs with astrology would probably depend purely on population densities between different cultures. If things were fully uniform it would average out, but given they aren't, some residual bias existing wouldn't surprise me. reply ape4 4 hours agorootparentprevI predict: people will be warning warm jackets on your birthday reply nerdponx 3 hours agoparentprevThere are several different astrology systems in use that draw on various world spiritual/astrological traditions, make different astronomical assumptions and adjustments, etc. There are also lots of different things that could factor into a birth chart reading, so different astrologers might put more emphasis on different aspects.

Empirical evidence is the basis of science, not reputation. No one, no matter what they've done before, gets to present their hypotheses as fact without evidence. One problem that outsiders to a field have is that we may lack the background knowledge to evaluate the evidence for a hypothesis. In that case, I try to rely on consensus rather than one expert opinion. reply mc32 4 hours agorootparentprevFluorescent talking alien raccoons!

We'd gotten into a discussion about how neither of us believe the explanation that astrology gives for how it works (that the position of the planets at the time of your birth influence your personality) but my sister thought a person's star sign might be a proxy for being born in a particular season which could reasonably affect someone's personality (ex: perhaps babies born in the winter share personality traits distinct from babies born in the summer). She also thought that given a list of people and descriptions of personality traits of star signs she could match them with better-than-chance accuracy. We made a list of ~10 people that she knew personally. I looked up their star signs and found a description of all 12 signs from an authoritative-looking astrology site. For each of the 10 people I gave her a choice of their actual star sign and two randomly picked star signs (determined and shuffled by an RNG). Random guessing would predict she'd have a 1/3rd chance of getting any individual person correct. She predicted she'd get ~7/10 correct. She got exactly 3/10. reply mihaic 4 hours agoprevThere's a famous study that found that hockey players are statistically more likely to be born in certain months, due to them being the biggest in their year-groups, which created a self-fulfilling cycles of attention from coaches.

I.e. if mothers' breastmilk composition varies based on the availability of fresh and nutritious food, or if nutritious food was available at the time of weining, or at their growth spurts, how much outside activity they had after learning to walk or run, what they seen mostly while learning to see, and so on, so the variations in the weeks and months when specific bodily and neurological development occur, that may have been noticable.

The statistical factor is actually age: the older kids perform better because they're more grown up (physically bigger, mentally more developed).

For example for an age group covering up to 11 years old in September 2024, the kids that are 10 years and 9/10/11 months old (so born in October, November, December 2013) will statistically be the best players of their group. reply DamnInteresting 4 hours agoprevIn the mid-to-late 1800s, many prominent astronomers were pretty sure there was another planet inside the orbit of Mercury, because Mercury's orbit has a peculiar irregularity. They called this yet-to-be-properly-seen planet 'Vulcan', and it became a fixture in astrologers' horoscopes. In the early 20th century, Einstein came along with his Theory of General Relativity, and with these equations he demonstrated that the sun's gravity was bending spacetime in a way that perfectly accounted for Mercury's wobble. Vulcan was therefore found to be a myth, nonexistent.[1] Nevertheless, many astrologers still feature Vulcan in their horoscopes even today, over a century later.[2] The inclusion of an entirely fictional heavenly body seems to undermine any other conclusions drawn from planetary positions. 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_(hypothetical_planet) 2: https://cosmicdeity.com/vulcan-astrology/ reply staminade 5 hours agoprevMy personal astrological projection is that none of the astrologers who criticised the original study, designed the new survey, or participated in the experiment will accept the validity of its results. reply visarga 5 hours agoparentTheir income depends on it! reply criddell 4 hours agorootparentIt doesn't really, at least not to a great extent.

It needs to be studied scientifically to gain credibility. Currently, conclusions are often drawn from small sample sizes (sometimes just 1-2 charts), and it’s presented more as an art than a science. I was drawn to astrology because, in India, it’s deeply embedded in the culture. Personal predictions and predictions about my family members that came true piqued my interest. For example, an astrologer told my father when I was in 10th grade that I would never complete my graduation, which was revealed to me only after I dropped out of college. Despite being a top student with scholarships, this prediction came true, sparking my curiosity. There are many similar stories, particularly related to Agastya Nadi Jyotish. For instance, in my Agastya Nadi prediction, 10-12 sentences described my wife. Individually, each sentence was generic, like \"she will be a middle child\" or \"she will not be tall,\" but the probability of all being correct is quite low. Except for one detail (she was predicted to have a master’s degree, but she only has a bachelor’s), all were accurate. Such experiences can lead one to believe in astrology. However, I’ve also noticed that people who believe in astrology tend to remember the accurate predictions and forget or dismiss the inaccurate ones. For example, many people for whom I’ve done chart readings (as a hobbyist, for free) often recall the predictions that came true when they meet me after many years. reply notaustinpowers 4 hours agoparentprevI keep up with astrology personally since I do find that my beliefs, practices, and actions line up fairly closely with my sign (Cancer).

Since we met this year and she considers me an exceptional man, she believes I'm the guy of the prophecy. However, because the first part of the prediction is true, she's quite stressed about the second part. Based on those two data points, Taiwanese fortune tellers seems to be quite on point.

I remember when this researcher was trying to recruit participants for this study off of social media, which was widely met with skepticism in the serious astrological community. It is nearly impossible to find truly skilled astrologers who would agree to participate in a study like this off of Twitter, those who have studied the decade(s) or more required to be proficient. Real Astrology requires an uncommon mix of character; one must be both scholarly and intuitive, while also recognizing the symbolic nature of things. These qualities, in the proper balance to succeed at the craft, are rare. Further, only astrologers who study traditional techniques can yield accurate results, and these \"accurate results\" are archetypal in nature [1]. Modern astrology is a free-for-all with a very high woo quotient, and mostly caters to the young. (My personal take is that Astrology is a divinatory, participatory \"science\", and can't be statistically analyzed [2], though the Gauquelins did just this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_effect) [1]: By archetypal I mean: astrologer sees Jupiter transiting the 5th house and predicts a child born in the coming year; no human child is born, but given the general signification of the 5th (\"children\"), the native did publish a book, which they labored over, and loved. Statistically it was a miss, though archetypally it was a hit; this must be understood by all in order for it to be meaningfully true.

Would you ask a snake oil salesman his views on the benefits of snake oil? :) reply Cthulhu_ 4 hours agorootparentSure, that's the scientific method / debate; person A says snake oil does not work, person B says it does, let's have it out. reply drowsspa 4 hours agorootparent> Do not be so open-minded that your brains fall out reply tpush 3 hours agorootparentprevThat's not how the scientific method works, at all. reply giraffe_lady 4 hours agorootparentprevA relevant historical fact here is that the reason the snake oil salesman is a fraud isn't because snake oil is ineffective, but that what he's selling isn't snake oil. reply Dylan16807 4 hours agorootparentIf say it's both with snake oil. And we see both in the study. The charts can't predict anyone and the claim of even having a consistent system falls apart. reply jonwiseman 4 hours agoprevSo, yeah, but an interesting chunk of results: is the inter-rater agreement ACTUALLY random? (Not sure if this is formatted correctly, feel free to comment if you'd do these stats differently) from scipy.stats import binomtest # stats: {experience_level: (rate, num_in_group)} stats = { \"lvl1\": (20.5, 156), \"lvl2\": (22.2, 66), \"lvl3\": (23.3, 50), \"lvl4\": (21.2, 39), \"lvl5\": (20.8, 12), \"lvl6\": (28.3, 5), } for lvl, (rate, num) in stats.items(): num_tests = num * (num - 1) res = binomtest(int(rate * num_tests * 0.01), num_tests, 0.2, alternative=\"greater\") # with multiple comparison correction with bonferroni print(f\"{lvl}: p-value = {res.pvalue:.4f} {'*' if res.pvalueA good astrologer won't say with precision that X is going to happen > Does it work? It's a bit like the weather, I can say this range of things under this archetype will happen on X date at X time. That's pretty much it. If it was like the weather, then it would predict the odds of specific things. Sitting on an archetype is like saying \"it's summer\" when you want to know if it's going to rain. > Anywho, I expect a good roasting and some down d00ts for my interest in t is subject. This line in particular deserves downvotes. reply Eumenes 5 hours agoprevLets do animal sacrifices next. Are the auguries true? We need a data driven approach to analyzing entrails. reply SkyBelow 4 hours agoparentCan't wait to see that IRB proposal. Do you think it would be able to pass at all? Maybe limit it to sacrificing invertebrates? reply toss1 4 hours agoprevNice study! My conjecture on why astrology persists despite not working: it is the refinement of two very human traits, ambiguous statements and confirmation bias. Astrologers can leave just enough ambiguity in their statements so it seems definite but could be interpreted either way, and when actual events happen later on, confirmation bias (often accompanied with a desire to believe and be proven right) kicks in and \"confirms\" the result. Rinse, repeat, ad infinitum. To the degree it seems to provide a benefit by giving people the feeling that the chaotic world is explainable, perhaps it is a good thing, far less good than science and far better than flat-earth/Qanon style conspiracy theory worldviews. Science is a positive good, astrology somewhat harmless (aside from being wasteful & distracting from real science), and the flat-earth/Qanon conspiracy worldviews actively harmful. So, perhaps if astrology can be leveraged to pull people away from the conspiracy worldviews, it could be good? Although, if anything, the motion seems to be in the other direction. reply CuriouslyC 4 hours agoparentAstrology continues to exist because people like to have a cognitive frameworks that give them comfort and a feeling of control over the randomness in the world around them. That is why we still have religion, which is just as bullshit as astrology and way more toxic for society. reply prewett 2 hours agoprevIt must because their signs are all wrong because they didn't account for the precession of the earth's axis... /s https://www.livescience.com/4667-astrological-sign.html reply razodactyl 4 hours agoprevTl;dr: the conclusion is exactly as expected. reply Mathnerd314 5 hours agoprevtl;dr No, it doesn't work - statistically it's identical to random guessing. reply SkyBelow 5 hours agoparentIs it equal to random guessing (which isn't fully random) or closer to true randomness? If the latter, can we use it as a PRNG? \"Now powered by Astrology\" branding, for markets where it would increase sales. reply a-french-anon 4 hours agorootparentDamn, you beat me to it. I was already picturing something like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand but with astrologers in cages instead of lava lamps. reply voidUpdate 5 hours agorootparentprevCan we use spiritual randomness to power our AI products, to maximise marketing crap? reply WaffleIronMaker 4 hours agorootparentKinda? It makes me think of Randonautica: > Randonautica (a portmanteau of \"random\" + \"nautica\") is an app launched on February 22, 2020 founded by Auburn Salcedo and Joshua Lengfelder. It randomly generates coordinates that enable the user to explore their local area and report on their findings. According to its creators, the app is \"an attractor of strange things,\" letting one choose specific coordinates based on a certain theme. It gained controversy after a report of two teenagers coincidentally finding a corpse while using the app. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randonautica reply voidUpdate 4 hours agorootparentThat sounds fun. Reminds me of GeoHashing (https://www.xkcd.com/426/) reply pavlov 5 hours agorootparentprevAstrological predictions on the blockchain seeding an AI model. reply Mathnerd314 4 hours agorootparentprevI don't think they have enough data to tell, but that seems like a logical next step - determine just how random it is and perform all of the statistical tests of randomness. reply KingMob 4 hours agorootparentprevI don't think they examined true randomness, but they did look at inter-astrologer consistency, and that was also no better than chance, which strongly suggests their answers were uniformly distributed (rather than being wrong, but everyone being wrong in the same way). reply Jean-Papoulos 4 hours agorootparentprevIt would be trivially easy to scrape astrology websites and use it to feed a \"true randomness\" service... reply Cthulhu_ 4 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn't, since the planets and stars' movements aren't random reply benterix 4 hours agoparentprevtl;dr: 1) it doesn't work, 2) little correlation with experience, 3) no agreement between the astrologers themselves reply swayvil 4 hours agoprev [–] Astrology is one of those techniques where the uninitiated ran away with the metaphors and turned it into a big LARP. Give it a thousand years and much of our science will look much the same. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
