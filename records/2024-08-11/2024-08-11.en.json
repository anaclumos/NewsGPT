Web specs & browser internals tend to be highly object-oriented, and life is easier when you can model specs closely in your code.

I don’t know for what reason someone would use it outside for Apple environment. reply factotvm 2 hours agorootparentYou can disambiguate two types with the same name from different libraries, e.g. `Factotvm.URL` and `Foundation.URL`. Do you mean something more full-featured? You are not prefixing types with three letters, if that's what you think has to be done. I don't know if it's still the case, but there was an annoyance where you couldn't have a type with the same name as the package. But that is hardly a lack of namespaces. reply refulgentis 1 hour agorootparentprevYou're right but this touches the hot stove. HN majority doesn't like hearing that ladybird et al might just be wandering around, even if the goal is catnip for the bleachers, and we should be skeptical this is the year of multiplatform Swift, because it wasn't last year if you actually tried it. Or the year before last. Or the year before that. Or the year before that year. Or the year before that one. reply afavour 20 minutes agorootparentI’m slightly more ambivalent than you about it. Swift is a nice language and has better ergonomics than C++ and I imagine a Swift codebase might find more contributors than a C++ one (maybe I’m wrong about that!) I also think it’s separate from the dream of “multiplatform Swift”. For that you need a healthy package ecosystem that all works cross platform, Swift doesn’t have that. But a lot of Ladybird is written at a low enough level that it won’t matter so much. reply charrondev 12 minutes agorootparentprevI mean this year we did have the porting of Arc browser to windows. I use it my gaming PC and it is starting to feel like it has a similar level of polish to the MacOS version. https://speakinginswift.substack.com/p/swift-meet-winrt https://speakinginswift.substack.com/p/swift-tooling-windows...

He also built a totally from scratch operating system, and built a very productive and skilled community around it, which branched into building their own web browser as SerenityOS has an 'everything from scratch' policy. How is Serenity not an interesting feat of engineering? You seem to call it a 'toy' because of where the development is at - this is grossly unfair criticism. By your measure, is all software that isn't at a 100% finished state a toy? reply RandomThoughts3 1 hour agorootparentIt’s going to be my last reply because I’m somehow flagged (really HN - I thought we were above that - seems like I hit a nerve with the Serenity OS fans). Neither Serenity nor Libweb are interesting. They are just copy of things we already did decades ago with nothing new to propose and severe NIH. They offer nothing of value above other open source projects which already do what they propose better (call that unfinished if you want). Heck, you can grab a 20 years old copy of Minix and find things which are infinitely more interesting than Serenity. Or Redox which while not trying to push the state of the art in design is written in memory safe language if you want something new. Ladybird and Serenity are famous because of streaming not because of what they offer. It’s influencer culture applied to open source which I despise. But unsurprisingly it’s a magnet for big co money which wants a cheap shot at being in the limelight. reply klohto 45 minutes agorootparentEnlighten us which BigCo gave Ladybird money? reply gkbrk 3 hours agorootparentprevReplying to this from Ladybird, which somehow doesn't exist but is able to both render and post comments to this page. reply askonomm 4 hours agorootparentprevLadybird very much exists.

On the (long) odds that you get all the way to a successful class-action suit, the lawyers get rich, and the class members eventually end up with a free year of credit monitoring (we have seen this over and over again in settlements for high-profile data breaches) reply alex_duf 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is true for any software though, so if we push that reasoning to its extreme, no one should ever use any free and open source software, which I find a little bonkers. reply amelius 2 hours agorootparentExcept browsers are more likely to leak your personal info than, say, a vector drawing program. reply solardev 23 minutes agorootparentprevSounds like a good way to get a $2 coupon off your next Google/Microsoft service after the class action resolves ten years from now. reply ddtaylor 1 hour agorootparentprevI'm fairly certain those big corporations are stealing that same information just paying fines and PR people to manage the backlash. reply RussianCow 1 hour agorootparentprevAre you really planning on suing Google for leaking personal info via Chrome? reply wongarsu 6 hours agoprevAccording to https://servo.org/about/ Servo currently passes ~60% of the web platform tests.

Edit (with Firefox): the above text is from Verso. Logging in works (though the session is not stored across restarts), as does both commenting and editing comments.

It also seems really really fast unlike the current www.reddit. If they remove some annoying ads I might even be convinced to stop using old. reply bee_rider 1 hour agorootparentThe only downside is that new is still being developed. Old is nice because it is shielded from their post-success incompetence. Whatever bad ideas they decide to implement will hit new first. reply jccalhoun 3 hours agorootparentprevIt is so crazy. I normally use \"reddit.com\" but a few weeks ago i followed a link to an article on \"old.reddit.com\" and saw I had notifications. I clicked the item and it was all notifications from days ago. So the read status of notifications on old reddit and current reddit aren't linked? reply CryZe 4 hours agorootparentprevnew.reddit.com seems to be an older layout than just reddit.com for me, one where most stuff still works (like video embeds). reply timeon 3 hours agorootparentAt least it is faster and seems to be less bug-y. reply spankalee 4 hours agorootparentprevMost pages, logged-in and logged-out, seem to be using the Lit version for me. I don't think it contained many visual changes, so you have to look for the presence of web components. reply hypeatei 4 hours agorootparentprevPretty amazing how a company can overengineer a basic feed that displays images and text (and ads). New Reddit is a dumpster fire, can't imagine another rewrite is going to fix it. reply 42lux 4 hours agorootparentYeah, I’ve never thought anyone could build a video player worse than realplayer but they achieved the impossible. reply throwaway894345 4 hours agorootparentprevYeah, one of the weirder things is that if someone blocks you, you are not allowed to reply to any comment in the thread (for example, if someone posts a toplevel comment and doesn’t reply to anything, and you reply to some comment a dozen layers below and have an exchange with some third party, if the toplevel commenter blocks you, you can’t reply to anything including comments left by others in response to your own comment) and you get a generic “internal server error”-type pop up with no information about why the request failed. This is most likely a server “feature” and thus a rewrite of the frontend won’t fix it but it seems like at very least the frontend could display a sane error message (assuming the backend forwards some information about the cause of the error). reply mminer237 2 hours agoparentprevIn my tests, it's pretty unusable atm. Probably half of websites render very wrong and servo crashes nonstop. reply Galanwe 50 minutes agorootparentIt cannot crash its written in Rust. reply IshKebab 39 minutes agorootparentRust can absolutely crash. It crashes (\"panics\" in Rust terminology) in a memory safe way but it's still a crash (please don't try to redefine the word \"crash\" to be more specific than it actually is). And Rust can still have unsafe code so it can crash in memory unsafe ways too (though it is very unlikely unless you're doing things very wrong). reply rhabarba 2 hours agoprevEvery time a new browser appears and is applauded by HN, a NetSurf dev opens a beer... reply tcper 3 hours agoprevHave a read about Servo, it is binding with SpiderMonkey as JS engine. Is there some chance, that servo decomposed from SpiderMonkey? If it is not, I don't think anyone can tell difference between firefox and other browser use Servo. reply culi 3 hours agoparentThere's a lot more to a browser than the JS engine. And in general, we would want all of the browsers JS engines to be essentially the same. I think starting with an existing engine is the most logical approach reply abhinavk 2 hours agorootparentTrue but at this point of time, Firefox and Servo are using the same CSS engine, same JS engine and same compositor and rendering engine. reply fabrice_d 2 hours agorootparentThat still leaves you with at least the layout engine, all the DOM apis, all the networking, multi process model & sandboxing, web extensions support, that are different implementations. reply akira2501 44 minutes agorootparentprev> we would want all of the browsers JS engines to be essentially the same You say until there is a CVE found. reply mariusor 5 hours agoprevI'm happy to see work being done in integrating Servo into custom browser chrome.

[1] https://web.crabnebula.cloud/verso/verso-nightly/releases reply mdaniel 1 hour agoparentI'd hypothesize it's due to https://github.com/versotile-org/verso/blob/07a88a86347c6763... and I thought maybe that was the lowest GH offered since they used an actual number versus \"-latest\" but no, GH does offer 12 https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runne...

Incidentally, Verso is also the name of Lean 4’s DSL for typesetting documentation.[1] We are running out of words in the English language. [1] https://github.com/leanprover/verso reply mroche 3 hours agoparentThere are two simple solutions to this: 1. Translate the word to another language. 2. Get creative and make up an original name. Mixed translations, word-bashing, not-actual-words, there's a lot of options! Okay, so the latter isn't super easy but can be a lot of fun to do! In this case, it seems like a play on the core dependency name than choosing the actual word of \"verso\": servo -> verso. reply 627467 2 hours agoparentprev> we are running out of words in a 1000 years we'll be making this observation across the galactic internet. reply Emma_Goldman 2 hours agoparentprevIt's also the name of the most successful left-wing press in the English-speaking world: https://www.versobooks.com reply ericyd 3 hours agoprevIt might be the head cold I'm recovering from, but it took me about 3 passes to comprehend their tagline: > A web browser that plays old world blues to build new world hope reply onli 3 hours agoparentSounds like a Fallout New Vegas reference to me. Or maybe it is referencing what FNV was referencing? reply NBJack 3 hours agoparentprevI'm healthy at the moment and I'm still not sure I understand. Poetic perhaps, but a bit nonsensical. Old world as in the past? Older technology? Older ideas? Bad ideas? Blues, as in the musical genre? Or the feeling it conveys? Are we riffing on it here? Plays strongly suggests music, but the blues originated from specific cultural roots tied to the end of slavery (which is implied even further by 'old world blues'). New world, as in a better tomorrow, or something more akin to a new world order? Hope I think I get. reply cosmicradiance 1 hour agoprevIf anyone is willing to put an effort in building a new browser, I have just one wish - allow embedding open-source transformers in the browser; available for both the user and websites/extensions. reply TheRealPomax 2 hours agoprevIt'd be nice if people stopped recommending \"yet another new and exciting package manager for Windows\" that you have no idea of whether you can trust it or not. Git, Python, llvm, cmake, and curl all have perfectly normal windows installers available from their own websites, and if you're a programmer who has to, or chooses to work on Window, it's a good bet you already have either most or all of these already installed, making the job of completing your bonus objective probably one, maybe two installs at most. reply beart 1 hour agoparentIdeally, winget would be the way to go, but I haven't had good luck with it. There are a number of limitations and it doesn't feel like a polished and curated repo. It just feels like a wrapper around chocolatey, which has its own problems. Microsoft is the reason alternative package managers exist reply ncruces 1 hour agoparentprevScoop is nice because, like homebrew, it's easy for package creators to create their own “buckets” and distribute packages that way. reply TheRealPomax 1 hour agorootparentI'm sure, but it's also \"yet another package manager\" because everyone has their own favourite package manager. It's a nit, but it's nice when a README.md goes \"you need X, Y, and Z\" and doesn't pretend you need a specific method for that. Tiny phrasing change, zero real world difference of course, but it's a nice little sign that the folks running a project know that you know what you're doing on the OS you're working with (either by choice, or by paycheque =) reply jijojohnxx 3 hours agoprevInteresting perspective! reply 38 1 hour agoprevdoesn't work with windows https://github.com/versotile-org/verso/issues/118 reply ape4 5 hours agoprevTypo dont' -> don't reply revskill 4 hours agoparentActually i prefer the dont', easy to comprehend and spell. reply jeffhuys 4 hours agorootparentWow.

In general, the sites I want to browse use minimal JavaScript, prudently, if at all, just where it is strictly necessary to add little dynamic features. So, I don’t really care about JavaScript performance at all. Optimization sometimes introduces additional complexity, which might open up the possibility of security holes (at least it seems to be the case to me, as a not-security-related programmer. I don’t know anything about security on a technical level, so I’m interested in other perspectives on this from people that actually work in those sorts of fields). I wonder if there’s room for a browser engine that ditches performance and just focuses on correctness and safety. Rendering documents ought to not be computationally intensive, right? Advertisements of blazing fast JavaScript performance make me worry what corners have been cut. reply swiftcoder 1 hour agoparentprevMaybe if Chromium was written in a memory-safe language there would be fewer zero-days? reply fabrice_d 29 minutes agorootparentYes, and that's why Chromium moved to allow Rust code (pretty much like they did for Android). reply mrkramer 9 minutes agorootparentThey said some of the code can be rewritten in Rust but majority of the code cannot. Therefore they are stuck with C++ forever. Scary thing to think about. reply 38 2 hours agoparentprevI agree, no one should ever bother writing a new browser again, too risky. We should just use chrome forever reply hanniabu 1 hour agorootparentWhy not just fork chromium with all the Google analytics/tracking removed? reply devsda 1 hour agorootparentThere's ungoogled chromium for that. Also doing that doesn't solve the standards problem we currently have. Google is able to push through any \"standard\". And those standards \"unwittingly\" help them maintain their search/ad dominance or prevent competitors. For example see manifest v3 or FloC (a.k.a Topics API). Once they gain enough traction and become indispensible, you either implement them or risk losing users. reply samstave 2 hours agoprevSerious Question: With risk of being hated, this is an honest question: I've never sought out another browser than using pretty much any of the big three... Just because I have never had any sort of personal workflow/painpoint/interest in any of these other browsers/engines, that frankly I had never heard of and then another thing pops up every few years with yet another new one that I havent heard of -- but they all seem to have lively communities...

    "originBody": "CHEVY RAY Rust & Game Development Blog Archive Q&A How I Created 175 Fonts Using Rust Posted August 9, 2024 30 minute read rust Table of Contents: Before the Megapack The First Pack The Second Pack Legacy Goals for the Megapack Bigger and Better More Language Support Style Variations Kerning Completeness Better Quality Control Easier Deployment & Maintenance Raising the Bar Studying Font Design Photo References PIFO: My Pixel Font Tool How It Works Crates Used Step 1: Creating Font Sheets Step 2: Contouring Glyphs Gathering the Pixels Detecting Clusters Creating the Edge List Chaining Edges Remove Non-Corner Points Step 3: Kerning Tables Manual Kerning & Alts Automatic Kerning Step 5: Exporting TrueType Files Tile Sheets Packed Atlases Step 6: Quality Testing Step 7: Deployment Creating itch.io Projects Building & Uploading Conclusion In December of 2023 I launched the 175 Pixel Font Megapack, followed shortly by 42 individual packs for each font family. I created my own toolchain for generating, quality testing, and deploying these fonts... in Rust! In this post I'll walk you through the whole process. Check out the Pixel Font Megapack on itch.io! Before the Megapack Before we talk about the new pack, let's talk about the old packs. The First Pack Back in 2016, while I was starting work on Ikenfell, I was strapped for cash. I'd been making fonts for my games for awhile now, including 2 new ones for Ikenfell, and so I polished them up, created a few more, and sold 12 of them together as a pack on itch.io. These were fine. I've improved at font design tremendously since then, and so they're awful for me to look at now, but people liked them and they ended up being used in a bunch of indie games at the time. The Second Pack Since the response was positive, and the supplementary income was helping, I decided to do another pack two years later in 2018. This time, the font quality was bumped up a lot. I spent more time on the fonts, created kerning tables for them so they would render sentences better, and made them available in different pre-baked formats for different engines. I'd also just improved as a font designer. I also spent a lot more time and work promoting these. I also reached out to several indie devs who were making pixel art games at the time and asked if I could use screenshots of their games but replace the fonts with mine, as a way to demonstrate them in action. I combined those with a few mockups of my own of fake games. The amount of people who asked me where they could find some of these fake games... Legacy The pack was very popular and a financial savior for me, and I think these mockups helped a lot. They've been used in hundreds of indie games, even in big games like Nintendo's Cadence of Hyrule, created by local developer Brace Yourself Games. Seeing my fonts in a Zelda game, even if a spin-off, was motivating to say the least. Another one of my favorites was Get in the Car, Loser, by Love Conquers All Games, which made great use of several of the fonts. The writing in this game never fails to crack me up. I was very happy with these results, so it was only a matter of time before I decided to revisit pixel fonts. Goals for the Megapack After Ikenfell released, I was in pretty bad burnout for a long time and did not yet have the energy to work on another game. During that time, I continued to learn and improve my Rust programming skills. I also kept dabbling in pixel fonts, with the intent of eventually putting together another pack. But I knew I'd have to outdo the previous back, and I planned to do so definitively. Bigger and Better The first pack had 12 fonts and the second pack had 40 fonts, and this time I was determined to make a pack of... one hundred fonts! Not only that, but I also wanted to bump up the quality. I wanted more variety, fonts that could be used for sci-fi games, fantasy games, horror games, farming games, cozy games, and so on. I wanted to make the definitive pixel font pack. More Language Support The largest request (and sometimes complaint) with the previous packs is that they only had support for ASCII characters. This was stated clearly on the page, but unfortunately a lot of people don't actually know what ASCII is and conflate it with just plain text. There was no accented characters, meaning language support for the game was very limited. So this time around I chose to extend the latin character set to fully support \"EFIGS\" (English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish). Accented characters also appear in English from time to time, (eg. \"touché!\") so this would still improve support for unlocalized games. The final character set I settled on. I decided not to support any Asian or non-Latin based languages because I am not as familiar with those character sets and not only would I not be able to achieve the quality I wanted, but it would also make the fonts take an order of magnitude longer to create. I would still like to create a pixel font family some day that has support for many, many more languages. Style Variations One thing I noticed with the 40-pack was that people would mix and match the fonts a lot. Games often have a lot of UI, and good UI requires a lot of visual hierarchy. If all the text is the same size and weight, it's hard to make something stand out or recede, and readability suffers. This is more difficult with pixel fonts than regular fonts because they are not vectors and do not scale smoothly. So this time around, I didn't just want a big variety of fonts, I also wanted each font to be a family of styles supporting different sizes and weights. So for example, the Virtue font family comes with a whopping 20 styles! This way, rather than mixing fonts with completely different styles to add variation, developers could have the variation they wanted while remaining stylistically cohesive. Kerning Completeness Kerning was a big time hog when making my previous font packs. Because the tools I was using required every kerning pair to be manually entered, it was incredibly time consuming and also extremely error prone. Look at it this way—if I have just three characters A B C, these are the following potential kerning pairs: AA, AB, AC, BA, BB, BC, CA, CB, and CC. That's 9 total entries! In fact, you can calculate how many entries you (may) need by just squaring the amount of characters you support. My new fonts were going to support 176 characters, meaning I might have to enter as many as 176² = 37,976 kerning pairs... yeah not going to happen. So this time, since I was (spoiler alert) writing my own tool to generate the fonts, I decided to semi-automate this process to take care of a huge majority of the kerning, and do manual entry when the algorithm didn't suffice. Better Quality Control With definitely only a hundred (shh... he doesn't know yet) fonts in the oven, managing them all was going to be a significant task. With the previous font packs, I did it manually. If I found a stray pixel or a bug in the kerning I would fix it, re-export the font, test that the re-export worked and the error was gone, and then re-upload the assets to itch manually. Also, I just couldn't evaluate the overall quality of the fonts easily. So this time, I wanted to have a way to generate big sample texts of the font and visualizations of kerning pairs so that as I was working on the fonts I could preview them, easily spot problems, and see my fixes immediately. Easier Deployment & Maintenance Making kerning and quality control faster and more automated lead to the obvious conclusion that I should also make the entire upload/deployment process automated as well. My goal was to have it so that adding improvements the fonts, fixing errors, and creating new ones in the future would be simple, painless, reliable, and automatic and error-proof as possible. Raising the Bar While my previous fonts were well-received and decent quality, if I wanted to produce something that was much more impressive, I had to sit down and improve. Studying Font Design I've been a pixel artist since I was a wee child, and made a lot of pixel fonts, but I hadn't actually studied typeface design before. Ultimately, I was fairly ignorant when it came to both the history and the nature of traditional typeface design. So while I was working on these fonts, I spent a lot of time studying and learning as much as I could about the craft. A book that helped me a lot was Design School: Type by Richard Poulin. This was a great guide for beginners and acts as a comprehensive dictionary for the huge amount of terminology and conventions that exist in typeface design. Photo References Another thing I did was started taking and saving photos of text I saw out in the world. I found small shop signs, museums, art galleries, festivals, posters for local events, and book covers to be amazing sources of inspiration. Here's a tiny sample of photos from my reference folder: These are not for copying, but rather for studying. Look at some of these shapes, how some of the letters hang below the baseline, how certain letters are really thin while others are wide. One of my biggest takeaways from studying a lot of amazing fonts out in the wild is the realization that most \"fancy\" fonts actually don't go too crazy with all their letters. Usually fanciness is reserved for capital letters, and lowercase letters often get more subtle flair, with the occasional letter that jumps out at you. PIFO: My Pixel Font Tool To achieve these lofty goals, and because I wanted to and nobody could stop me, I wrote my own Rust program for creating pixel fonts: pifo! How It Works I like using my normal pixel art tools to actually design the fonts. When I make a font, I produce a PNG tilesheet and a config file to provide some metrics and settings to guide the tool. I can then feed these files into pifo: pifo --all --output \"Faraway\" --input \"Faraway*\" It then takes the image, chops it up into individual glyph tiles, generates contours for them, automatically calculates kerning pairs between them, and then gathers them all into a font and exports as a TTF file. It also exports the font in several other engine-ready formats. All the work done on individual glyphs is parallelized, making it almost instant for a single font. Running this process on 175 fonts one-by-one takes only a couple of seconds. If these processes were to run in parallel, it would be almost instant again. Crates Used I didn't need too many special crates for this, but the ones I used were very helpful. clap for command line argument parsing image for image decoding and encoding rayon for parallellization serde for data serialization glyph-names which maps char to glyph names ab-glyph for loading and rasterizing fonts crunch for rectangle packing Step 1: Creating Font Sheets Every font sheet has a tilesheet and config file that look like this: TOML version = \"1.0\" # font version baseline = 14 # baseline from the top of a tile line_gap = 0 # gap between vertical lines of text spacing = 3 # width of space character metrics = [] # manually assign metrics for glyphs auto_kerning = true # enable automatic kerning auto_kerning_min = -1 # never kern farther than 1 pixel left manual_kerning = [] # manually kern specific glyph pairs skip_kerning_left = \"\" # don't kern when these glyphs are the L-pair skip_kerning_right = \"\" # don't kern when these glyphs are the R-pair The grid size can change, but it must always be a uniform grid and the characters must always be in those positions. Only 100% white pixels will be processed by the tool, so the checkered background and baseline are merely guides that will be discarded when the sheet is processed. Step 2: Contouring Glyphs Once the sheet is ready, contouring can begin. This is the most complex part of the process, and so I'll go over all the steps of the algorithm here. TrueType glyphs are created out of one or multiple contours, which are basically closed shapes made out of curves. So for example, the letter i would be one contour for the dot, and a second contour for the rest of the shape. Because our fonts are pixel fonts, we need to create a contour for every connected group (or \"cluster\") of pixels. Using this lowercase t as an example, we need the algorithm to turn it from pixels into two contours A and B like so: It doesn't matter where the contour begins and ends, as long as it's a closed loop. Gathering the Pixels Starting with the glyph's image, we first need to separate out all the pixels of the bitmap, because that's all we'll really be operating on. Rather than working with the image directly, I found it easier to write the algorithms by working with collections of Point structs which look like this: Rust code // these have a bunch of derives, methods, and // constructors, but I won't list them all here #[derive] pub struct Point { pub x: i16, pub y: i16, } impl Point { fn new(x: i16, y: i16) -> Self { Self { x, y } } fn right(&self) -> Self { Self::new(self.x + 1, self.y) } fn left(&self) -> Self { Self::new(self.x - 1, self.y) } fn below(&self) -> Self { Self::new(self.x, self.y + 1) } fn above(&self) -> Self { Self::new(self.x, self.y - 1) } fn left_edge(&self) -> (Point, Point) { (Self::new(self.x, self.y + 1), Self::new(self.x, self.y)) } fn right_edge(&self) -> (Point, Point) { ( Self::new(self.x + 1, self.y), Self::new(self.x + 1, self.y + 1), ) } fn top_edge(&self) -> (Point, Point) { (Self::new(self.x, self.y), Self::new(self.x + 1, self.y)) } fn bottom_edge(&self) -> (Point, Point) { ( Self::new(self.x + 1, self.y + 1), Self::new(self.x, self.y + 1), ) } pub fn sign(self) -> Self { Self::new(self.x.signum(), self.y.signum()) } } Given an RgbaImage, we can collect all the white pixels into a HashSet: Rust code const WHITE: Rgba = Rgba([255; 4]); let pixels: HashSet = img .enumerate_pixels() .filter(|(_, _, p)| *p == &WHITE) .map(|(x, y, _)| Point::new(x as i16, y as i16)) .collect(); Detecting Clusters Now we need to group these pixels together into clusters so we can operate on and create a contour for them separately. So for our letter, we can identify that it should have two clusters. To do this we start by choosing a random pixel and \"flood filling\" it, spreading out into every adjacent pixel until there are no more it can spread to, and then that produces a single cluster. Then, we take the remaining pixels and repeat again, continuing this loop until there are no more unvisited pixels. The following algorithm does so: Rust code // generate a list of \"clusters\" of pixels that are connected together let mut clusters: Vec> = Vec::new(); { // to find clusters, we flood-fill pixels in the image, // removing them, until there are none left let mut pixels = pixels.clone(); let mut to_process = Vec::new(); // while there are pixels left while let Some(&p) = pixels.iter().next() { // add the pixel to the process list to_process.push(p); // create a new cluster let mut cluster = HashSet::new(); // while there are pixels to be processed while let Some(p) = to_process.pop() { // remove the pixel and add it to the cluster pixels.remove(&p); cluster.insert(p); // queue processing for all adjacent pixels // that have not yet been processed to_process.extend(p .adjacent() .into_iter() .filter(|p| pixels.contains(p)) ); } clusters.push(cluster); } } Creating the Edge List Now we have our clusters, each which represents one \"shape\" made out of contours. We now need to find the outline of each of them because that's what we'll be creating the contours out of. To do this, we first make a list of all the exposed edges of all pixels, where \"exposed\" means there is no adjacent pixel on that side. Just looking at one cluster, it looks like this: The code to create this list of edges: Rust code let mut edges: Vec = cluster .iter() .map(|p| { [ (!cluster.contains(&p.above())).then(|| p.top_edge()), (!cluster.contains(&p.right())).then(|| p.right_edge()), (!cluster.contains(&p.below())).then(|| p.bottom_edge()), (!cluster.contains(&p.left())).then(|| p.left_edge()), ] }) .flatten() .flatten() .collect(); Chaining Edges The next part is tricky. We need to take that list of edges and build a path out of them by attaching them together. If we imagine each edge as a (tail, head) tuple of points, then we can write an algorithm that attaches all the overlapping heads to all the overlapping tails to create a contiguous path. Rust code // each cluster will generate one or more contours let mut contours: Vec> = Vec::new(); // if we have edges remaining, start a new path while let Some((a, b)) = edges.pop() { // the contour starts with the first edge let mut contour = vec![a, b]; let mut end = b; let mut i = 0; while i = edges.len() { i -= edges.len(); } continue; } // check the portion before the last edge for a chain if let Some((j, (_, b))) = edges[..i] .iter() .cloned() .enumerate() .find(|(_, (a, _))| a == &end) { edges.remove(j); contour.push(b); end = b; i = j; if i >= edges.len() { i -= edges.len(); } continue; } break; } // the end point is the same as the start point contour.pop(); // add it to our contour list contours.push(contour); } This will create the following contour from the cluster: You may have noticed that this code assumes that each cluster can produce multiple contours. This is because if you have a cluster with a hole in the middle, that will in fact be the case: Also notice that whenever we have clusters with holes, the winding of the outside of the cluster is clockwise, but the winding of the holes is counter-clockwise. This is an artifact of how edges are provided in clockwise order, and is actually very lucky because that's exactly how TTF contours work! When you want to describe a hole in a glyph, you create an inner contour and wind it in the opposite direction of the outer contour. Remove Non-Corner Points While this will technically work, we can optimize this a bit more. When multiple edges connect in a line, we don't really need them all, do we? If we remove all non-corner points, we can shrink the file size and also increase rasterization speed. We do this after chaining, right before adding our contour to the list: Rust code // for every a→b→c sequence of points, if the normal of a→b is equal // to the normal of b→c, then we can remove b and link a→c directly let mut i = 1; while i= HashMap::from_iter([ ('A', \"ÀÁÂÃÄÅ\"), ('a', \"àáâãäå\"), ('C', \"Ç\"), ('c', \"ç\"), ('E', \"ÈÉÊË\"), ('e', \"èéêë\"), ('I', \"ÌÍÎÏ\"), ('I', \"ÌÍÎÏ\"), ('i', \"ìíîï\"), ('N', \"Ñ\"), ('n', \"ñ\"), ('O', \"ÒÓÔÕÖ\"), ('o', \"òóôõö\"), ('U', \"ÙÚÛÜ\"), ('u', \"ùúûü\"), ('Y', \"Ÿ\"), ('y', \"ÿ\"), ]); Automatic Kerning But manually entering thousands of kerning values is exactly what I wanted to avoid. Instead, most kerning pairs will be automatically calculated, and the manual system is to override the automatic system when it doesn't suffice. So how do we find a kerning offset for a pair of letters? Let's use LV as an example. To figure out their kerning value, we have to move V to the left pixel-by-pixel until it is as close to L as possible without touching it. So if we move it over one pixel... It's not touching, so a -1 is good so far. What happens if we try moving it again? Nope! Because two pixels are touching (corners touching counts), -2 is too far, so that means our calculated kerning for LV is -1! The code to do this looks like so: Rust code impl Point { fn surrounding(&self) -> [Self; 8] { let Point { x, y } = *self; [ Self::new(x + 1, y), Self::new(x - 1, y), Self::new(x, y + 1), Self::new(x, y - 1), Self::new(x + 1, y + 1), Self::new(x - 1, y - 1), Self::new(x + 1, y - 1), Self::new(x - 1, y + 1), ] } } // calculate the kerning for this glyph and the right-hand glyph pub fn calculate_kerning( left: &BitmapGlyph, right: &BitmapGlyph, min: i16 ) -> Option> { // the start position is 2 pixels after the first letter let mut kern: i16 = 0; let mut offset: i16 = left.max_pixel.x + 2; // if the left letter has no pixels blocking, we don't want // to kern into infinity so we stop at zero while offset > 0 && kern > min { offset -= 1; // translate every pixel in the right-side image by the offset // and then see if that shift would cause any pixels to touch if right .pixels .iter() .map(|p| Point::new(p.x + offset, p.y)) .any(|p| { // after the pixel is translated, check all positions // surrounding it. if any of those positions touch any // pixels on the left glyph, we cannot kern here p.surrounding() .iter() .any(|adj| left.pixels.contains(adj)) }) { break; } // this shift was safe, so increment the kerning kern -= 1; } NonZero::new(kern) } Given our current manually assigned kerning list, we can now extend it with the automatically calculated ones. Rust code // ignore manually assigned kerning let ignore: HashSet = kerning .iter() .map(|k| (k.left, k.right)) .collect(); let skip_left: HashSet = desc .skip_kerning_left .chars() .collect(); let skip_right: HashSet = desc .skip_kerning_right .chars() .collect(); // calculate automatic kerning let min_kern = desc.auto_kerning_min.unwrap_or(i16::MIN); kerning.par_extend( glyphs .par_iter() .filter(|left| !skip_left.contains(&left.chr)) .map(|left| { glyphs .par_iter() .filter(|right| !skip_right.contains(&right.chr)) .map(move |right| (left, right)) }) .flatten() .filter(|(left, right)| !ignore.contains(&(left.chr, right.chr))) .filter_map(|(left, right)| { calculate_kerning(left, right, min_kern) .map(|kern| { KerningPair { left: left.chr, right: right.chr, kern: kern.get(), alts: None, } }) }), ); I won't go over every line of this because it's interacting with several other parts of the codebase, and kind of doing a lot. But basically it respects the ignore settings in the font's TOML file, and also calculates all the kerning pairs in parallel using rayon. With all the kerning calculated, we can now create the TTF files. Step 5: Exporting PIFO doesn't just generate TTF files, it also exports the fonts as tile sheets and packed texture atlases. With each of these, multiple data formats are provided, so you can use whichever you prefer. TrueType Files The OpenType format is pretty involved, and has a huge amount of features that I do not need for these fonts. TTF files are binary files made up of a bunch of blocks of data, called \"tables\", that each contain different information about the font. The font starts with a table directory which provides the memory location for each table so that font parsers can easily jump around to access the information they want. My exporter populates the following tables: Table Description head Global font information hhea Horizontal layout information maxp Memory requirements OS/2 OpenType font requirements hmtx Horizontal metrics cmap Maps characters to glyph index loca Maps index to glyf table location glyf Glyph data (contours) kern Kerning pairs name Strings for font, author, style, copyright, etc. post Required for valid TTF file I won't go over all of it here, but my code to write a table looks like this: Rust code // `hmtx` table data.begin_table(Tag::Hmtx); { // longHorMetric - hMetrics[numberOfHMetrics] for g in &font.glyphs { // advanceWidth - Advance width, in font design units. data.write_u16(px_to_un(g.adv as i16) as u16); // lsb - Glyph left side bearing, in font design units. data.write_i16(px_to_un(g.lsb)); } } data.end_table(); Every table needs to record its position, length, and checksum, so begin_table() and end_table() help do this. The px_to_un() function converts pixels to font units, and looks like this: Rust code let fake_height = 16; let units_per_em = (2048 / fake_height) * fake_height; let scale = units_per_em / fake_height; let px_to_un = |x: i16| x * scale; Normal fonts can be displayed at any size because they're made of smooth curves, but pixel fonts don't have that luxury because pixels are discrete and so you must always render them at multiples of some base size or you'll get a wobbling effect that looks really bad. So I decided that the base size for all my fonts is just 16, meaning that rendering a pixel font at that size will always produce pixels that are exactly 1 px in size. When you want to scale up the text without wobbling, you can just draw text at multiples of 16, so 32, 48, 64, etc. Tile Sheets Fonts are also exported as tile sheets. Unlike the input sheets that group characters of similarity together, these sheets are ordered by their unicode codepoints: Each comes with a data file with font and glyph metrics: JSON { \"cols\": 14, \"rows\": 13, \"tile_w\": 8, \"tile_h\": 17, \"baseline\": 14, \"line_gap\": 0, \"space_w\": 3, \"glyphs\": [ { \"chr\": \"\\u0000\", \"lsb\": 0, \"adv\": 8 }, { \"chr\": \"!\", \"lsb\": 0, \"adv\": 2 }, { \"chr\": \"\\\"\", \"lsb\": 0, \"adv\": 4 }, { \"chr\": \"#\", \"lsb\": 0, \"adv\": 7 }, This data file also contains a kerning table: JSON \"kerning\": [ { \"left\": \"i\", \"right\": \"j\", \"kern\": -3 }, { \"left\": \"i\", \"right\": \"ì\", \"kern\": -1 }, { \"left\": \"j\", \"right\": \"j\", \"kern\": -2 }, To do this, I put this data into the following structs and use serde to serialize them into the various supported formats (JSON, XML, TOML, etc). Rust code #[derive(Debug, Serialize)] struct Sheet { cols: u32, rows: u32, tile_w: u32, tile_h: u32, baseline: i16, line_gap: i16, space_w: i16, #[serde(skip_serializing_if = \"Vec::is_empty\", default)] glyphs: Vec, #[serde(skip_serializing_if = \"Vec::is_empty\", default)] kerning: Vec, } #[derive(Debug, Serialize)] struct Glyph { chr: char, lsb: i16, adv: i16, } #[derive(Debug, Serialize)] struct KerningPair { left: char, right: char, kern: i16, } Packed Atlases Versions with the glyphs tightly packed into a texture atlas are also exported: I use my own rectangle packer crate crunch to do this: Rust code let PackedItems { w, h, mut items } = { let items: Vec> = font .glyphs .iter() .enumerate() .filter(|(_, g)| g.pixels.len() > 0) .map(|(i, g)| { let w = ((g.max_pixel.x - g.min_pixel.x) + 2) as usize; let h = ((g.max_pixel.y - g.min_pixel.y) + 2) as usize; Item::new(i, w, h, Rotation::None) }) .collect(); crunch::pack_into_po2(2048, items).unwrap() }; Because positioning info is lost in a tightly packed atlas, the data files for these have a bit more information to help you render text correctly: JSON { \"size\": 12, \"line_gap\": 1, \"space_w\": 3, \"glyphs\": [ { \"chr\": \"\\u0000\", \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0, \"w\": 7, \"h\": 9, \"off_x\": 0, \"off_y\": -8, \"adv\": 8 }, { \"chr\": \"!\", \"x\": 118, \"y\": 36, \"w\": 1, \"h\": 7, \"off_x\": 0, \"off_y\": -7, \"adv\": 2 }, These are serialized and exported into different formats in the same way as sheets: Rust code #[derive(Debug, Serialize)] struct Atlas { size: u32, line_gap: i16, space_w: i16, #[serde(skip_serializing_if = \"Vec::is_empty\", default)] glyphs: Vec, #[serde(skip_serializing_if = \"Vec::is_empty\", default)] kerning: Vec, } #[derive(Debug, Serialize)] struct Glyph { chr: char, x: usize, y: usize, w: usize, h: usize, off_x: i16, off_y: i16, adv: i16, } #[derive(Debug, Serialize)] struct KerningPair { left: char, right: char, kern: i16, } Step 6: Quality Testing If I wanted to achieve the quality of fonts I desired, I knew there would have to be some kind of system to make quality evaluation quick and easy. Once PIFO was up and running, I added one more feature to it: the ability to generate gigantic sample images. First, I start with displaying all the letters and a few test sentences. The sentences are an excerpt from the short story They're Made out of Meat by Terry Bisson. This is followed by a collection of test words. These words aren't random, and are taken from Text for Proofing Fonts: A farewell to The Quick Brown Fox, a very useful strategy for improving font quality testing. I want all combinations of digits to look nice, so next up I render all possible pairings of those, as well as currency symbols: Then I render a huge row of uppercase, lowercase, and mixed-case kerning pairs: This last one continues for awhile. Finally, I render a bunch of test punctuation: With PIFO immediately generating these sample images as I was working on the fonts, I was able to improve and tweak them very quickly, greatly increasing the overall quality and polish level of nearly 200 fonts! Step 7: Deployment With my original goal of 100 fonts massively overshot, I now had a whopping 175 PIXEL FONTS to find a way to put up online for download. There are many places to sell things online, but I decided to stick to my tried-and-true, itch.io. itch.io is an open marketplace for indie creators Creating itch.io Projects The most tedious part of deployment was having to create an individual itch project for each of the fonts. Luckily, I only had to do this once for each font. Once it was done, uploading and maintaining them could be done completely via command line scripts. Building & Uploading My deployment script has three steps: make sure PIFO itself is compiled build the font assets update each font's itch project with the new assets The first step is simple, I compile PIFO itself in release mode so it is as fast as possible: deploy.bat cd pifo cargo build --release || exit /b %errorlevel% Next, I use PIFO to build the font I want. deploy.bat cd ..\\input ..\\pifo\\target\\release\\pifo --output \"../distro/faraway\" --all --input \"Faraway*\" The --input \"Faraway*\" means that it will find every font that starts with that text and compile/package them all together. So in this example, there is Faraway - Regular, Faraway - Bold, etc. and they all get put together into a single package for the \"Faraway\" font family. Finally, for deployment, I use butler, which is a super handy command-line deployment tool provided by itch for exactly this purpose. butler push ../distro/faraway chevyray/pixel-font-faraway:assets Butler tracks changed files and only updates the parts it needs to, so I don't have to do any file hashing or special versioning to save data. Conclusion Phew, and that's how I shipped 175 pixel fonts on itch.io created using my own Rust tools! I hope this was interesting, informative, or even helpful to people who are learning Rust or are curious about what might go into a project of this scale. I really wanted to start my new site off with a really high quality post, and I thought this would be a great subject. If you'd like to see more content like this, a great way to support me is to buy my pixel fonts on itch.io, or share them around with others!

I found myself thinking about a different copyright corner-case when reading the post and this question: the fact that typefaces aren't copyrightable in the US. Fonts are, as computer programs, but typefaces (and so also fonts that are simple bitmaps) aren't. So this workflow goes from a non-copyrighted source, (the original tilesheet) to a copyrighted output (the TTFs) and also back to a non-copyrighted output too (the output tilesheet/atlas). reply BHSPitMonkey 2 hours agoparentprevIf you like platformers, give Celeste a try.

A link to play Celeste Classic: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145. https://tig.fandom.com/wiki/An_Untitled_Story reply Daub 16 hours agoprevImpressive indeed. Making a complete font set can easily take as long as a year. The tasks include to go from 'A' to 'Z', upper and lower case, plus all the glyphs (brackets, ampersand, exclamation marks etc). Optionally the variations (bold, italic etc) without which a font is of limited use. The thing that separates the men from the boys is the kerning (spacing between the characters) which can absorb as much obsessive compulsion as you can throw at it. From TFA: > My new fonts were going to support 176 characters, meaning I might have to enter as many as 176² = 37,976 kerning pairs... yeah not going to happen. So this time, since I was (spoiler alert) writing my own tool to generate the fonts, I decided to semi-automate this process to take care of a huge majority of the kerning, and do manual entry when algorithm didn't suffice. reply p4bl0 11 hours agoparent> Making a complete font set can easily take as long as a year. The tasks include to go from 'A' to 'Z', upper and lower case, plus all the glyphs (brackets, ampersand, exclamation marks etc). That's when you're limiting the font to purely English usage. If you want to support any other language you have to add more characters, even for languages that also use the latin alphabet (e.g., French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, etc). Then you may want to support Greek and Cyrillic, Japanese, Chinese, … For example, “Noto fonts cover over 77,000 characters, which is around half of the 149,186 characters defined in Unicode 15.0” according to the font's Wikipedia entry. reply inferiorhuman 14 hours agoparentprevMaking a complete font set can easily take as long as a year. Making a font family can easily be a lifelong project. reply chevyray 12 hours agorootparentIt makes me very happy to see people talking about how much work can go into a typeface. Like, these pixel fonts are very quick to make, but fully contoured vector fonts can be tweaked to perfection infinitely, there's always more languages and more diacritics and more weights and styles you could do. Truly a rabbit hole, but when it's done well it's very worthwhile. I have a lot of respect for font makers. reply galangalalgol 51 minutes agorootparentHas anyone tried training a DL model to handwrite things? That seems like a fascinating rabbit hole as well. In addition to all the context sensitive letter differences, you could even label training pieces with the mood of the writer and the flexiness of the nib/quill. If I type an angry emoji after a sentence it gets scribbled harder when drawn. reply amelius 6 hours agorootparentprev> Making a font family can easily be a lifelong project. Donald Knuth made https://www.1001fonts.com/cmu-font.html __and__ designed and implemented an entire typesetting system __and__ did a bunch of other not-so-small things that makes designing a font family seem like a side project. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 2 hours agorootparentTex was the side project. Knuth went on a years long yak shave to write book-making software instead of writing the book because he was unhappy with the fonts in the printer proof. reply czarit 8 hours agoprevVery nice! One question: I was curious why you chose this subset of Scandinavian special characters. There are three extended chars in Swedish (äöå) and Norwegian/Danish (æøå), but your fonts have æ, but not ø, which means you could drop the æ and still support Swedish, or add an ø to also support Norwegian and Danish. Was this an oversight or is there some locale that has just æ and not ø? (and before anyone asks I did not confuse æ with the oe-ligature œ, which is a different glyph used in French, and which the fonts also do support) reply kd5bjo 8 hours agoparent> Was this an oversight or is there some locale that has just æ and not ø? Well, Icelandic uses ö in place of ø, but also requires ð and ý which are not included. Æ is sometimes used in older English texts, though, in words like “encyclopædia” or in plurals of latin-derived words: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_plurals_in_-... reply chevyray 3 hours agoparentprevThis was just an oversight. I actually got very far into the project before I realized that ø was missing from my set. It’s something that I could definitely go through and patch into all the fonts, but I was waiting to see if there was enough demand for the effort. I think supporting two more languages would be very cool though. reply kipari 2 hours agorootparentFrom a Dane that finds multiple of these fonts gorgeous and highly appreciate the elaborate kern pairs: please consider patching the fonts with an ø. ;-) reply swiftcoder 10 hours agoprevFascinating, I didn't previously realise you were converting pixel fonts to vectors when encoding them to TTF. I guess that gives some ability to seamlessly scale them for folks who load them into a competent text renderer as well (i.e. not a game engine that mostly just uses pixel fonts 1:1) reply chevyray 10 hours agoparentIt also just makes them usable in traditional graphics editors like photoshop, indesign, affinity, aseprite, etc. Those tools do not have the concept of a pixel font, so using a TTF with hinting/antialiasing turned off allows you to use them in those apps. reply nitinreddy88 17 hours agoprevI actually liked some of the fonts and simple styling used in the site.

I think it would definitely be possible to speed up a lot of the algorithms with some tricks. Replacing hashmaps with bitmaps and byte-index arrays for character painting and ascii-to-variants seems like a lead, based on what I've read. Of course, that doesn't really matter for this code since it's already fast enough. reply chevyray 12 hours agoparentGlad you brought this up, because it's absolutely true! All the code is not on the site, but I actually allocate and clone a lot of strings and data structures as well. I did optimal code where it was obvious (bitmap copying, easily parallelizable things), and it was SO instant that I didn't even bother trying to optimize the other things. But it could be done! It's easy to forget how fast on-the-ground languages like Rust and C++ and Go are, not to mention when you use their multi-threading primitives and worker queues/etc. reply Vecr 17 hours agoprevInteresting how easy it is to make an operation like this run on multiple cores in Rust. Inserting a single call into a chain of functions can be enough. reply MontagFTB 17 hours agoparentRust is built to be memory- and thread-safe by default. Assuming you follow the prescribed rules of the language, multithreading is “free”. Amdahl’s Law still gets a vote, but at least your app won’t blow up in your face. reply jjtheblunt 16 hours agorootparent> Assuming you follow the prescribed rules of the language, multithreading is “free”. I'm wondering if you're referring to the async await addition from a few years back, to use of Tokio's crate(s), or something else. reply kevincox 16 hours agorootparentI think they are referring to this section: https://chevyray.dev/blog/creating-175-fonts/#automatic-kern... In this case they are not using async but Rayon which provides some easy primitives for splitting tasks into smaller parts that can run in parallel. In this case the par_iter and par_extend calls. reply hypeatei 8 hours agorootparentprevIIRC, async/await in most languages doesn't imply multi threading, it just allows other work to be done on the same thread simultaneously. reply vips7L 16 hours agoparentprevIt's not really unique to Rust. Scala and Java both support this out of the box. reply dwattttt 15 hours agorootparentThe stronger guarantees/performance fall out of the stronger lifetime/ownership model, combined with errors around ambiguous/invalid lifetimes being a compiler error. In other languages those violations are things you have to run a race detector and actually evoke the condition to find, or you abandon fine grained/tracked ownership and use garbage collection. reply vips7L 14 hours agorootparentNone of that matters with this code. There are no lifetimes here and in fact there is no ownership either. Everything is a primitive char. They’re always copied and no mutation occurs. It’s pure computation. You could write this code exactly the same way in those languages. reply dwattttt 12 hours agorootparentTrue. You could write it in C or asm too, and it would be about as simple. But there's still a difference that if they weren't all primitive (and you can't always rely that they will be), you'll know it won't work straight away in Rust, whereas in the others you need to walk every data type involved to make sure ownership is clear (or rely on a garbage collector to save you). reply n_plus_1_acc 5 hours agorootparentprevJava's HashMap for example is not thread-safe, but if you use it from multiple threads, you may or may not experience all kinds of issues. reply vips7L 2 hours agorootparentAgain that only matters if there is mutation. Reads are perfectly safe to happen from any thread. This code is self contained. Rust isn’t a silver bullet here. reply Filligree 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but in Rust it’s far less likely to explode in your face. reply johnisgood 1 hour agorootparentOr in Ada. Ada 202x[1] brings enhancements like the parallel block, making parallelism easier to express, somewhat similar to Rust's approach but still with Ada's emphasis on clarity and safety. [1] https://blog.adacore.com/ada-202x-support-in-gnat (2020) There may be more enhancements that I may not know about or remember, although I did mention Ada's constructs for safe concurrent code before. reply peteforde 15 hours agoprevWhat an amazing accomplishment! Bravo. I find typography resists my attempts to wrap my head around it, because even though I can do basic analysis like serif vs sans serif, I get a sort of brain fog when it comes to telling fonts apart or intuiting which fonts to use in different situations. It's really hard to wrap my head around the idea that one person could make 175 fonts and that they would each be meaningfully different from each other. Like, how does one not accidentally recreate the same font? reply chevyray 12 hours agoparentSometimes I would get pretty far into a new font only to realize it was almost a total copy of another. It happened, I just managed to notice before releasing them lol reply omnimus 12 hours agoparentprevActually it is impossible to recreate the same font from memory. Even if you tried the font would be in some ways different. With pixel fonts where the grid is very coarse its much easier to do but normal fonts with curves you wont make it. Even if you are using same image of a font as a reference. reply kmacdough 7 hours agoprevAwesome work! It's a wonder how much hasn't been done in a world of 8 billion people. A single skilled individual with some free time filling in a gap can be HUGE. Gets me looking for gaps. 8 Billion people seems like a lot, but it cuts down fast. When 1/10 people have the freedom and, 1/100 the resources and time, 1/100 the training and experience, and 1/100 have the drive, and with hundreds of domains each with hubdreds of major unfilled niches... That's 800 people split among tens of thousands of gaps. It pretty quickly gets down to you, the reader, to pick up that keyboard and start tapping away! These are obviously wild-a* numbers. Constraints may be overstated or understated & they're not fully independent. I'm missing others. The point stands: you need only to cut 8 billion by 100 a few times to geteach glyph is a multiple of 8px wide These look to be variable-width fonts. I believe the heights are multiples of 16, but the width will vary by character. reply bryanlarsen 15 hours agorootparentIt appears that the \"tile sheet\" export puts the fonts on a fixed width grid, so that can be used for a fixed width font. They look left-justified in the grid though, and fixed width fonts usually have the glyphs centered in their grid. That could be fixed with some scripting. reply two_handfuls 13 hours agorootparentprevThey are variable-width yes but there is also a monospace variation, those will be constant width. reply Vecr 16 hours agoparentprev16. Or an integer multiple of that like 32 or 64. It's in the Step 5: Exporting section Edit: that's the height, the width is not fixed/I think it varies with the exact font and the kerning. It's probably too big for you anyways. reply bentinata 16 hours agoprevEven though the methods is simple, the way the author visualizing it is really neat. reply worik 16 hours agoprev [–] Nice work I would like microns on the vowles, as we type a lot of Māori words.... reply Daub 14 hours agoparentSame here for diacritics in Vietnamese.

It lets you contribute to OSM in a very simple manner, via simple questions like, \"Is there a marked crosswalk here?\" I'm not affiliated, I just think it's cool. It's very satisfying to complete quests in your local area. [0] https://streetcomplete.app/ reply Freak_NL 8 hours agoparentStreetComplete is fun for casual contributions, but what OSM really needs is good local mappers. You can tell when a place has local mappers updating and monitoring changes in the real world. Even just taking care of the coming and going of shops is really useful. People who visit your area using apps like OsmAnd and OrganicMaps use that data! reply pacbard 2 hours agorootparentLocal mapping is surprisingly difficult. I believe that the commercial products (i.e., Google Maps) are viable only because there are strong incentives for people (e.g., business owners, property owners) to submit edits as they are the main way that people search for them. Without that, you get into a limbo where you have data but it's not the most updated one. By the way, not even government agencies have good geo data, even when they should. I needed up to date address information for work, so I bought a map from my local county assessor's office. In my mind, the assessor should have the most recent data on properties, as their main mission is to collect taxes annually. I was wrong. Their data is about 4 to 5 years wrong, with whole \"new\" subdivisions missing from their inventory. Google Maps kind of has them on the map; I believe that their geolocation data comes from real estate platforms when new houses are on the market. OSM is about 10 years behind in my area. I am submitting edits as I find them. If someone has a better idea on where to find address data, please let me know. reply wcedmisten 55 minutes agorootparentMaybe try the National Address Database? https://www.transportation.gov/gis/national-address-database... reply tacostakohashi 1 hour agorootparentprevThe assessor's mission is all about parcels and tax lots though. For that purpose, it's not 4 to 5 years wrong, it is current, but they don't care what the \"address\" is. Not all parcels have an address, or are on a street. The only addresses they care about are where to send the bill. reply maxerickson 1 hour agorootparentprevOpenStreetMap barely has any users in many areas. It seems likely enough that a modest amount of traction would lead to people noticing out of date information much more quickly. reply hnarn 2 hours agorootparentprev> Even just taking care of the coming and going of shops is really useful. This is exactly why I contribute to OSM and add/remove/fix my favorite restaurants, bars etc. in the city I live in. I feel like I'm doing three nice things at a time: helping local companies, making travel better for tourists, and sticking it to $the_man[1] [1]: whatever corporation is currently responsible for sucking up data on what beer I drink, what pizza I eat, and what clothes I wear, so they can cross-references it with my haircut, circle of friends and lidar-scanned calves measurements from my robo-vacuum while i'm taking a shit to sell me keyrings and usb-cables from china reply xethos 8 hours agorootparentprevI cannot describe [0] my pleasure and satisfaction when, visiting Germany, we found an icecream shop closed. We'd stopped by with the assumption Google Maps would have the correct hours; they did not, and we carried on without icecream. OSM, on the other hand, correctly showed the shop as closed for the day. [0] I can't, but my fiancee used the words \"impossibly smug\" reply netsharc 6 hours agorootparentWhen a huge highway bridge collapsed in Genoa, I checked OSM a few hours later, and someone had already updated the road segment as permanently closed Video has clips of the bridge falling and aftermath: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53628580 reply ygra 4 hours agorootparentGoogle cheats here, though. They were able to show a recently completed bridge as completed simply by the fact that traffic was passing over it. OSM still had it within half an hour of opening, though. reply Freak_NL 3 hours agorootparentThe other way around is where OpenStreetMap is faster though. With Google a road which is closed (or gone) for a longer while means someone has to report it and Google employees verify it. Doing this automatically based on traffic dropping to zero is not really possible, because the algorithm doesn't know why traffic is rerouted or for how long. This can take a while depending on the number of people reporting it to Google. OpenStreetMap mappers can act autonomously much faster (errors are sometimes made, but often picked up and reverted just as fast for high profile stuff). Google actually fucks up royally when a road below the level of a motorway/freeway is closed and formally withdrawn from public use, but still sees some traffic (by people illegally using it and people with legitimate goals like construction workers). There is a road near me where this is the case. Google will happily route cars over a road where one of the two lanes is in use as a soil depot for the nearby housing developments, and gates on both sides block the road. Those gates are shoved aside or bypassed by driving through the grass by a handful of simpletons. A bit of observation during a walk there showed me two cars passing there illegally; a postal worker and a power utility guy. Two types of road users who likely use Google Maps quite a lot, and drive up the virtual traffic there. On OpenStreetMap this road is simply closed and limited to private use (i.e., the construction workers hauling soil), and has been for a number of years now. reply AlpineG 3 hours agorootparentGoogle took about 6 months to accept my edit to an incorrectly named park near me. I took pictures of the signs as proof of course I could not submit them as evidence but a thought someone else would report it. In OSM I could change it in a few minutes and I am not very familiar with the tool. reply dtech 8 hours agorootparentprevI mean, both rely on community contributions for this sort of thing, so it feels weird to be smug about this... It just depends on who decided to put the correct hours in. reply xethos 7 hours agorootparent\"Smug\" was mostly tongue in cheek. More than anything, it was a breath of fresh air seeing OSM, a product so heavily reliant on it's community, beating out one of the most well-funded corporations on our planet. Google has satellite views, they run their own network of vehicles to gather streetview data at a planetary scale, they follow every Android user (with Google Services installed) to know popular locations, new and closed businesses, likely opening hours, travel times, and more. They (at one point) pushed users to update store information, and then (from everything I've heard) charge out the ass for embedding a Google Map view. I am ecstatic that we have a free-as-in-beer, donation and corporate sponsorship funded, open-for-all map that not only can go blow-for-blow with this absolute behenoth, but in this case actually won. So while \"smug\" may be overselling it, \"thrilled\" would not be reply mrln 5 hours agorootparentIs OSM not free-as-in-freedom? reply xethos 5 hours agorootparentAFAIK it is, but I thought I'd stick to claims I was all but certain of when posting from mobile and (because of that) not fact-checking Bit of an ironic one to leave out though, considering my preferences with most of the software I use and enjoy. reply mathstuf 5 hours agorootparentprev\"Smug\" is what I would give the Google Maps response that I submitted when we came across a store closed due to wrong hours (in Seattle). I sent a picture of the hours plate and the response was \"nah, we think Google Maps is correct here\". I stopped submitting error corrections to Google after that. reply kaba0 4 hours agorootparentprevGoogle has been atrocious all across Europe ever since Covid. They used to have (maybe still do?) this local guide thingy, but this empathetic contribution doesn’t feel good for a for profit company. reply michaelt 2 hours agorootparentAt one point Google developed a spam problem with map contributions, IIRC. Some assholes worked out it was pretty profitable to (for example) create a '24 hour emergency locksmith' pins all over the country, with no real physical presence, then pass the business on to a real locksmith a few towns over, while taking a cut. Once people find it's profitable to provide fake user contributions and you have to start policing them, I imagine the value of user contributions drops significantly... reply ygra 4 hours agorootparentprevBut surveying shops coming and going works really well with StreetComplete as well (check the places overlay). Besides, the app is such a wonderful gateway drug to OSM that even if the only benefit at the end of the day from most mappers were road surfaces and building levels, there's still a few people who become good mappers beyond StreetComplete. I started with SC in March 2021. By now nearly no quests remain in my village, nearly every building has proper building and roof colours, I have far more changesets by now with JOSM and I strive for at least one changeset every day. I won't touch bus routes, though. They're scary. reply andrepd 7 hours agorootparentprevRe: shops/businesses, it would be nice if we could find somehow a way of having businesses themselves update their details: just basic stuff like opening hours and contacts. Not sure what's the solution for this though. One half of the solution certainly is just a convenient (web) UI for this, minimal friction just go to this website, enter your info, and click okay. But the other half is even making businesses aware that this is a thing. Mailing flyers with a QR code? x) reply SideburnsOfDoom 6 hours agorootparentAbsolutely. In Theory a business could make an OSM account and just go and update their own details on www.openstreetmap.org. From my point of view this is easy. But as we have seen by the experience of how bad restaurant websites are, this is a significant barrier for these businesses. I'm not knocking them: I couldn't run a restaurant; it's just different skills and experience. It's on the software people to make the software easy enough for restaurant people to use. reply SideburnsOfDoom 8 hours agorootparentprevI do this local mapping, and I also use StreetComplete. I find it's not one of the other, it's \"Why not both?\" e.g. new coffee shop opened down the road? I'll take a picture of it on my phone, go home and open https://www.openstreetmap.org/, click \"edit\" and add it, along with info from the phone photo (Shop name, Address, phone number, and a website if I can find one). The next time I'm nearby, StreetComplete will prompt me for other key info such as opening hours. They compliment each other. On the one hand, the full OSM experience is much richer than StreetComplete. On the other hand, StreetComplete is a gateway drug to it, and also a useful accessory to it. reply linker3000 5 hours agorootparentThis is how I work. Having a dog means that I can record updates and additions as I walk varied routes around the area. Updating the map later using its Web interface is very satisfying and much more worthy than doomscrolling through social media (which I don't really do anyway). reply eisa01 10 hours agoparentprevAnd until there's an iOS version [1], you could try EveryDoor - especially great for POIs [1] https://github.com/orgs/streetcomplete/projects/1 [2] https://every-door.app reply raybb 9 hours agorootparentFor folks not too familiar with OSM, POI are points of interest, usually shops, parks, water access, restroom, etc. Just one point and a few labels. Much easier to map on the go than sidewalks or buildings that require more precision. reply IndySun 2 hours agoparentprevI use GoMap!!. It's comprehensive and a little clunky to use. I had not heard of streetcomplete. A quick suggests it is similar but a welcome alt. reply deng 9 hours agoparentprevYes, I can also confirm that it's a great way to lose weight, as it gives long walks a sense of purpose. ;-) reply weightedreply 3 hours agoparentprevThanks for sharing! I'm glad there is an FDroid version. I think I'll enjoy this while on walks. It's like gamification for map stewardship. I remember when OpenStreetMap was new. I added a short missing footpath in my neighborhood at the time. It was a shortcut between homes. Today that same path even displays a very slight 1° turn. Amazing. reply bartread 7 hours agoparentprevSadly does not seem to be available in iOS App Store in the UK or I would love to. reply eddyg 5 hours agorootparentTry https://every-door.app/ reply bartread 5 hours agorootparentExcellent, thank you! reply jcynix 7 hours agoparentprev> consider installing the StreetComplete mobile app [...] I'll second that and I'd add the tip to install its companion app StreetMeasure too in order to measure things like the width of a street or the length of other things. When on holidays or a weekend trip visiting places I often use StreetComplete to add missing data while walking around with my wife. And recently in the South of France I had to answer questions about the width of rather small streets in an old town center where my guesses wheren't very good. Then StreetComplete suggested that I use StreetMeasure and I got much better estimates. reply ygra 4 hours agorootparentI carry a laser distance meter for that sort of things. Also wall/hedge/fence heights, etc. Besides, you can just ... not answer certain quests if you're unsure of the answer (or need to use estimation – there's tagging for estimated widths, but it's not used by StreetComplete). But I also found it handy to figure out the sizes of common paving stones, which makes sidewalks rather easy to measure without actually measuring :) reply m4rtink 7 hours agoparentprevCan really recommend StreetComplete - really fun to use & using it right now on a day trip to improve a less mapped area. :) reply yonatan8070 2 hours agoparentprevTurns out I have new mini-hobby now, thanks! reply PontifexMinimus 6 hours agoparentprevGoogle Maps used to have geolocated pictures taken by users (IIRC this was called Panoramio). If OSM had an app that allowed you to take photos and they'd be automatically uploaded with location, that'd be great. reply ygra 4 hours agorootparentMapillary or Kartaview are the typical choices here to add free street-level imagery which can then be used for OSM purposes as well. What also works is Wikimedia Commons. There's a good mobile app. You can take pictures of a POI, upload them and later associate them with that object in OSM (or via Wikidata). reply nurgasemetey 9 hours agoparentprevIs it normal that website gives 403 Forbidden? reply ainonsense44 3 hours agorootparentNo reply deng 10 hours agoprevThe amount of data OSM has nowadays is a treasure. It's just a shame that there's no well done generic web frontend that would make all this data accessible in a way that could rival Google Maps. The official openstreetmap.org web site just provides bare functionality with an almost unusable search, and otherwise focuses on editing OSM data. Probably the best generic \"frontend\" for OSM is Organic Maps, which however is confined to Android and iOS. I think if there would be a web version of Organic Maps, this could greatly accelerate OSM adoption. reply aembleton 7 hours agoparentI think mapy [1] is the best frontend I've seen for OSM. Its search still isn't as good as Google Maps though. They also have iOS [2] and Android [3] apps. I can't speak for the iOS app, but the Android one lets you download offline maps in a very space efficient way, similar to Organic Maps. 1. https://en.mapy.cz/zakladni?x=-2.2989613&y=53.1629710&z=8 2. https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/mapy-cz-maps-navigation/id4114... 3. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.seznam.mapy... reply afavour 6 hours agorootparentI feel like an ass just for saying it but I downloaded the iOS app at the map style is so… busy. Granted I’m in NYC so there’s a lot going on but it’s showing me every single bus stop (there are literally seven in a one block radius) and building outlines even when zoomed out. It’s very visually overwhelming. This is something Google and Apple Maps really nail, I hope OSM can too at some point. reply jwagenet 3 hours agorootparentIMO the default OSM tileset is terrible and the mapy set seems to be the same/similar. I guess it’s meant to show a lot of information, but the colors and patterns are noisy, the icons are too detailed, too many or too few things show up on the wrong layers. It’s been this way forever. reply beej71 5 hours agorootparentprevI get what you're asking here, but I think it's important to note that OSM's primary value is in its data, not in a human-consumable map. So if I could respectfully amend your request, I'd say I hope some third party can really nail this at some point. Organic Maps is pretty good, but I still need Google maps for a number of things. But even if that doesn't ever happen, the free OSM data is invaluable in a large number of GIS contexts.

I think it’s in the projects interest for that default to be as good as it can be, rather than rely on third parties. reply jwagenet 3 hours agorootparentprevNeither mapy nor the default tileset should have maximal information. Perhaps you can argue google is primarily for navigation and default OSM is not, but that doesn’t mean it should have all the OSM data represented at each layer. reply lol768 4 hours agoparentprevIt's all a bit of a licensing nightmare as well, if you want to embed the maps. If you want actual FOSS, you need to be aware of which libraries to avoid (i.e. don't touch anything Mapbox with a bargepole anymore - to be honest, their anti-union, anti-open agenda put me off a few years ago regardless of the license change, which is a shame because they used to do really good work). reply openrisk 7 hours agoparentprevIndeed, discovering all the goodness people have built on top of OSM is not particularly easy, especially for non-technical users.

And I try to get to build specialized maps with https://mapcomplete.org reply deng 9 hours agorootparentQwant Maps is discontinued, sadly. Features I would want most from a web frontend for OSM: * Smarter search in the local area that is currently focused, with possibility to search for generic terms like \"atm\", \"bus stop\", \"bakery\", etc. * Display of shops/restaurants/markets/etc with additional information like opening hours (which are available in OSM, I've added a ton of it through StreetComplete and often wondered why I even bother as no one will ever see them). I can easily live without reviews, they are easily gamed and would need a ton of moderation. * Public transport information. There's currently work ongoing in Organic Maps to support this. * Navigation, yes, to some degree. I think this area is actually already quite well covered through services like Komoot, for instance. For car navigation, you probably will never beat Google Maps because of the available current traffic information there. reply karussell 8 hours agorootparentMay I recommend GraphHopper Maps? A bit routing focussed but soonish also for POIs: https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-maps/pull/394 Also addresses in the current view are more important when you search.

It's a real shame that DDG chose to drop it for a much worse alternative. OSM has been an absolute necessity when out hiking in the sticks, and knowing that someone has done work to map this trail out without expectations from me. It's also led to many useful derived maps like public toilets and parking and accessibility. I've always made it a point to try and contribute back whenever I can. reply circularfoyers 11 hours agoparentI believe they did it because OSM in most places is very outdated or even non existent for businesses, which was probably one of the top uses of it in a search engine. Having contributed quite a lot to OSM, I can say though that it was generally a lot better for hiking tracks than Google maps. reply hk__2 10 hours agorootparentAgreed. For up-to-date info on businesses I rely on Google Maps, but for hiking it’s totally useless compared to OSM. I still buy some \"official\" paper maps of the area I hike in because I’ve had bad surprises with OSM, mostly because some mappers sometimes invent some paths based on outdated, blurry aerial imagery, with no real experience of the area.

Interestingly, through OSM and even Apple Maps you see just how difficult it is to build a mapping dataset. One story I heard was that the Chinese government intentionally makes its published maps inaccurate by basically offsetting it by a few meters. I'm not sure if this is still current. I'm not sure of the reasoning. It's not like it would stop an invasion if the highway was a few meters from where you thoguht it was. Anyway, to counter that humans basically had to adjust the published maps by overlaying them onto satellite photos to remove the error. AI helps with this but it's still labor intensive. IN addition to being labor-intensive, there are so many disparate data sources that you need to match up. Much of that data conflicts. The likes of Yelp and even Foursquare exist primarily by selling location data. Even something like listing the opening hours of a business is incredibly labor intensive. Google has (had?) a system where an AI would call the business to ask their hours of operation. I think they had to modify it to say it was an automated call. Oh you want directions? I guess you need accurate direction data for roads. You probably need to know where bike paths are. Different locales can define a bike path differently. In some places bikes can share the road with cars. In others they can't. You want to integrate public transit? Well, every place is going to have a weird API. It's a good example because something that seems so simple involves a ton of labor and integrating thousands of data sources.

Even in my densely-populated area with tons of OSM contributors a lot of POIs are still outdated because restaurant and store owners care only about their website/Instagram/FB or Google Maps and don’t know about OSM.

The problem with OSM is that they cannot reasonably include other data with a license that also requires attribution at the usage site. That little »© OpenStreetMap contributors« in the corner would balloon into 600 different entries. Unless they all are fine with not being mentioned, but they typically do that not for free. There are a number of exceptions. A few CC-BY datasets can be used in OSM because the owner is fine with an entry on a Wiki page is sufficient attribution; Bing and Esri allow their aerial images to be used and only require the changeset to mention the source; etc. But each of those is a separate agreement. reply K2h 5 hours agoprevOn ios i have been a beta tester and use the free program go map!!

Before Firefox, there was Mozilla, which had a BeOS port (called Bezilla). Bezilla was bloated and slow. So the BeOS community tried to make a stripped version of Mozilla with only the browser (minus all the bloat). This project became an inspiration to do the same for Mozilla, and that product became Firebug (or something similar - edit phoenix, then firebird), which due to trademark conflicts got renamed to Firefox that we all know today. So in a round-a-bout way, we have come full circle after 20 years, Firefox is finally ported to the platform that inspired its creation. Kind of poetic. We should write a 3-5-3 Haiku about this journey. reply simcop2387 6 hours agoparentIt wasn't Firebug, that was a developer tool extension. It was first Phoenix which hit trademark issues, and then Firebird which hit trademark issues, which then became Firefox. reply guessbest 1 hour agorootparentMaybe it hit trademark issues, but the reason I remember from slashdot was that phoenix was already a semi-popular open source project in the debian repository, so firefox had to be named from phoenix to mozilla-phoenix. But firefox at the time still named phoenix just ran so much better on windows than linux, it was funny. reply simcop2387 56 minutes agorootparentBoth Phoenix and Firebird were over the naming and trademark clashes: For firebird, https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/mozilla-holds-fire-i... and https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/mozillas-fir... in this case it was AOL Time Warner that owned the Firebird trademark for the database. 2) For Phoenix, https://web.archive.org/web/20070914035447/http://www.ibphoe... the main reporting on it seems to be lost but wikipedia still backs it up reply Foobar8568 4 hours agorootparentprevFrom what I remember, Firebird was more related to the database open source project which was a fork of InterBase, so at that time it was relatively well known due to its roots with IB. reply pjmlp 6 hours agoparentprevWith a fraction of the userbase it had 20 years ago, thanks to everyone that keeps shipping Chrome with their applications, testing only with Chrome developer tools, and so on.

They shipped a series of \"M\" numbered (ie milestone) releases, which preview what we today think about as normal dynamic HTML but at the time it commonly just crashes the entire browser. Like, a colleague was working on code that would reach into the DOM and just tweak the CSS for a bunch of items, delete other items, move things around, and maybe 40% of the time it would work as intended, and 60% of the time, boom, dead browser, segmentation fault. React, where it's just normal for Javascript to rewrite the entire page in response to a keystroke, would have been completely unthinkable, there's no chance you could fill out an entire form before the browser crashed if you do that. reply pjmlp 3 minutes agorootparentReact only became possible due to JavaScript JITs being made available, almost a decade later.

I thought people mostly use Haiku inside VMs like VirtualBox so network connection goes through an emulated fiber. I dream of Haiku being ported to Raspberry Pi and I even was sadly surprised it isn't - to me the primary value of Raspberry Pi seems it being an uniform standard hardware platform, this sounds like a great enabler for alternative OSes as lack of need to support all sorts of different hardware makes the thing a lot easier. reply llm_trw 7 hours agorootparentThe raspberry pie is a very odd computer which is hard to develop for. There are much better targets that are both simpler to develop for, cheaper, and easily available. reply rcarmo 5 hours agorootparentAnd we never really got any of them working, so I would contest that. Many years ago, I asked about Pi 2 support on the Haiku forums and there was a lot of ill will towards Broadcom closed binaries. I pointed at the Plan9 port and a couple more examples and nothing happened. I tried the same thing several times with the Pi 3 and the Pi 4, and someone more vocally pointed towards RISC-V. Some four years later, there is a somewhat working RISC-V port, but in the meantime there is still no working ARM port of any real use. On the whole, I was not overly impressed with the Haiku OS community where it regards exploring widely popular platforms that, despite having some challenges, would provide them with a larger audience. It's their call, but as an original BeOS user (and who can actually spot the Be Book from my couch as I'm typing this) and someone who's spent the past two years delving into the Rockchip ecosystem, I'm quite saddened by the way things went.

Because I was a big computer nerd at the time, huffing all the OS/OS fumes I could get my grubby little hands on. Windows 3 had already won the game -- and that was when non-computer-nerds were asking their computer-nerd friends for advice and getting PCs hand-built by the same. When win95 came out, the non-computer-nerds forgot that the command line existed. When win98 came out, even computer-nerds were losing interest in the command line. Win2k was (imho) the best windows operating system ever released. It was extremely stable and usable, supported everything but apple software and a few bits and bobs that nobody but us nerds cared about, and it took serious effort to buy a computer that didn't have it installed by default. So a year after win2k is released, your selling points are \"basically usable\" ( vs \"highly compatible\"), \"free/[nerd-shibboleth]\" (vs \"hidden in the cost of a computer\"), and \"easy to install\" (vs \"already installed\"). I think it's hyperbole to suggest that BeOS being open source would have dramatically changed the course of computer history. If anything, I think it's worth considering what would have happened to the already-paltry Linux Desktop experience if BeOS absorbed developer attention. reply mook 47 minutes agorootparentWhile I agree that Win2k was good, I don't think it was quite that popular; The computers you could normally get were still Win98/Me until WinXP.

It's typically only the most toxic that you’d use such equipment to not be exposed at all (but then we tend to avoid those anyways). You start to recognize the smell of ethers like diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (which I love the smell of). Sulfides are obvious (smell terrible). I made a mistake a couple times smelling things I shouldn’t. Once was diazomethane gas - a potent akylating agent and explosive. I instinctively put the roundbottom flask to my nose to smell, but realized after how dumb it was. No idea if i heavily alkylated my nasal passage epithelial cells or not, but no side effects. The other time was a brominated aryl compound similar to tear gas. That was amazingly painful and felt like getting wasabi up my nose despite there being almost nothing left in the flask. One time which wasn't intention was smelling CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate, a reagent used to add a protecting group to nitrogens). I didn't intentionall smell it, but measured it outside the fume hood in a syringe. It smells pretty awful, but what I realize is that the molecule must bind to your nasal passages (proteins have lots of nitrogens) because I could smell it for the next 24 hours.

It's a low boiling point oxygenated hydrocarbon solvent, so it smells like you'd expect - think things like rubbing alcohol, ethanol (vodka), paint thinner (the ones that have alcohols in them). Diethyl ether smells very \"heavy\", for lack of a better word, and pungent. It's almost overpowering, and can become unpleasant after a while. Tetrahydrofuran (which is just diethyl ether with both ends of the ethyl groups bonded to form a ring) has a \"lighter\" smell, isn't overpowering and smells \"clean\" to me. It's still a oxygenated solvent, so it's not pleasant like the smell of flowers or spices, but to me it's more similar to ethanol which is relatively pleasant. reply Aloha 1 hour agorootparentSorta like fresh naphtha with the volatiles still in it, and everclear combined?

As someone that has built and managed clinical laboratories for human samples, I find this article from consumer reports extremely misleading. The describe results as a percentage of a theoretically acceptable level. For example, for cadmium, they are saying an acceptable level is 4.1 ug/day . Then they seem to imply that \"TJ The Dark Chocolate Lover's Chocolate 85% Cacao\" has 229% of the 4.1ug/day if a consumer ate a 30g piece. They never actually spell out what they mean or what the actual results they found were, or what the limit of detection of the methodology was or the error range of their tests. I guess they are saying that that chocolate has 9.3ug of cadmium in a 30g sample but it's impossible to say from what they wrote. The FDA states that the maximum daily consumption of cadmium should be limited to 0.21-0.36ug per kg of body mass. For an avg american male that would mean a threshold of 17.64-30.24ug/day. A typical salad containing 250g of romaine lettuce has 2-14ug of cadmium in it. Lettuce and cereal grains are the most common sources of cadmium in american diets.

Then there are[2] multiple orders’ of magnitude worth of chasm that are considered[3] varying degrees of OK if you’re a particle physics experimentalist or radiochemist, nuclear reactor technician, or—worst of all—astronaut. At the high end of that, it starts to matter if you’ve received the dose all at once and in which place of your body and which kind of radiation it was. (I mean the units are supposed to take the last two points into account always, but here those correction factors can start to matter.) Finally, there are a couple of orders of magnitude where you inevitably and gruesomely die at varying speeds, and after that nobody lived long enough to report. The chasm is where you get single-percentage-point increases in multi-decade incidence of cancer and such, which is what you probably care about. (Don’t get me wrong, that can amount to a lot of dead people in the wrong circumstances, not to mention infertility.) Fortunately for humanity but unfortunately for your particular question, AFAIK we don’t have enough data to tell with any degree of certainty just how bad any particular point of that chasm is, and there’s no straightforward way to acquire that data. As far as dramatic death, though, tens of nanograms of polonium inside your body (which is an especially nasty thing to have there) will absolutely kill you dead. That's on the order of 0.1 quadrillion atoms. Of course, those atoms are exceptionally easy to detect, comparatively speaking. As another point of reference, lethal doses of nerve agents are on the order of a milligram and up. [1] https://xkcd.com/radiation/ [2] https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/01/f46/doe-ioni...

So therefore you get people calling out (for example) ceramics containing CdS glazes, which haven't been shown to harm anyone using them (the finished ceramics, not the glazes themselves). But of course, even for definitively \"toxic\" things, one must differentiate between exposure channels. I wouldn't care if I handled a piece of Greenrockite [1], but I wouldn't want to breathe the stuff in powdered form.

You don't want your dry cleaner dumping used methylene chloride in the river, but it's commonly used in decaffeinating coffee.

I mean, yes, exposure \"channels\" are absolutely important, but its the (false) assumption that one \"safe channel\" lowers the general risk of the other channels being an issue. Your particular example mentions powder - what happens to the substance after it is crushed in a landfill? Or involved in a high speed collision, exposed to high heat, uv rays, microwaved, etc. Potential harm should include the risk posed by all channels as a function how likely they are to be in that state. If the likelyhood is at 100% over any \"reasonable\" period of time, then you don't get to ignore the effects of that \"channel\". Worse, if any of the channels are difficult to detect, then the risk should be compounded - I know about wood dust and can both easily see it and am amply aware when it is an issue and can take precautions. I'm not sure I can even identify the material you mention nor would be able to distinguish it from just \"normal\" dust. reply hvs 18 hours agorootparentprevOn the plus side, it's a step up from the general public's: \"X is bad because it contains chemicals!\" reply Dylan16807 20 hours agorootparentprevThe comment you replied to does not say or imply anything about toxicity. reply timr 20 hours agorootparentI wasn't criticizing the parent.

To improve bioavailability of a compound, attempting to add on either a methyl or acetyl group may help. Depending on the compound, skipping this step may cause the compound to be relatively inert.

I’m sure there were delays and issues on EE’s end, as it always goes with hardware, but it’s still EE’s design, parts sourcing, and manufacturing run that DEFCON just took over last minute? I don’t know the terms of their contract, but that wouldn’t fly in a typical contractor setup. You can’t just cut out the contractors labor costs after the fact. I’d be more inclined to give DEFCON the benefit of the doubt if they canceled the entire project earlier on and engaged a different contractor to build an entirely different badge from scratch. Given that dimitri wasn’t even paid for the firmware(!), my guess is this was low budget. For something of DEFCON’s scale, this can’t really be a “for fun” hacker project if you want to guarantee results. The “for fun” part is ensuring the attendees can all have a good time hacking on the badge, not the people doing the labor. reply tptacek 21 hours agoparentOn the contrary, if you have a signed master and SOW for a project, you absolutely cannot just bill over or outside of the SOW because of \"contractors labor costs\". The whole point of contracts is to agree to costs up front and eliminate these kinds of on-the-fly disputes. reply dredmorbius 15 hours agorootparentSOW: Statement of work.reply jhaand 4 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on the contract. I will never just do a single SOW contract and risk it all. I will do an hourly contract and maybe give a discount if a certain amount of money is spent because things get tough. The client will get an estimation but in this day and age, prices will vary in a few months. Entropic Engineering should not have gone through with this project on this timescale of 6 months with a new chip. Defcon badge team doesn't know how to properly outsource electronics, collaborate and do risk management. reply bjornsing 20 hours agorootparentprevBut as I understand it EE did not bill outside or over the SOW. They just sent updated cost estimates indicating that they wanted to. reply tptacek 20 hours agorootparentAll we have to go on are the statements, but DEF CON's statement is falsifiable and direct: After going overbudget by more than 60%, [and] several bad-faith charges Which, again, pattern matches to a pretty common mode in which consulting projects blow up: you give an optimistic estimate, learn partway into the project that you were hopelessly off, and then try to invoice your way through it. reply bjornsing 10 hours agorootparentEE’s statement is about as falsifiable and direct I would say: Once a month, we billed for our work and submitted an updated estimated per badge final cost - committing as costs built to discount our work as necessary in order to hit DEFCON’s per unit cost targets. In June, after 5 months of late night work, badges were fully designed, prototypes were working, and mass production was ongoing with the manufacturers we contracted on behalf of DEFCON. We billed DEFCON for our most recent work, discounting our labor by 25% in order to meet the agreed upon targets. Unfortunately, we were instead met with a work stoppage request and informed we would no longer be paid for services already rendered. Easiest way for me to reconcile these is by assuming that DEF CON’s statement about going 60% over budget is referring to the estimated per badge final cost, not actual invoices. But yea, it’s hard to know what happened here just based on these statements. reply aestetix 19 hours agorootparentprevI would be very interested to know what DefCon's budget for the badges is, and how much latitude was built in for things like chip shortages, rush shipping, etc. A big project like this, especially during major geopolitical strive, could have all sorts of unforseen complications. DefCon has been around the block a few times and should know how to handle things. But without details, it's impossible to know for sure. reply joezydeco 18 hours agorootparentThis one seemed a bit riskier, using the new Raspberry Pi microcontroller that's not even for sale yet. Granted, the parts were probably donated, but getting the timelines right must have been a concern. reply 5ci3nc3 18 hours agorootparentprevI'd like to know why badges are being used at all. It's DefCon- isn't there a more creative way to handle security? reply tptacek 18 hours agorootparentPeople love these stupid badges. That's why they get made. reply borski 15 hours agorootparentprevEvery other year they build a hackable “smart badge,” and people love to hack on those things. Are they necessary? No. They’re toys. But they’re fun. reply llm_trw 13 hours agorootparentprevIt's not defcon's job to figure out how EE should charge for their projects. reply Aeolun 17 hours agorootparentprev60% over budget sounds sort of within the realm of reasonable? Most projects that go over budget reach 100-200%. If you agree to get monthly invoices instead of one fixed cost project, then you are implicitly agreeing that costs are variable. reply kelnos 14 hours agorootparentThat's the thing that's weird to me. If DEFCON had a hard cost limit that they were unwilling to go over, structuring the contract with monthly invoicing based on materials and ongoing labor costs makes no sense. It would seem to me that the only sane way to do this would be to make it a fixed-cost $X contract, and the only monthly (or otherwise periodic) part of it would be to split payments by milestone or by some other rubric. reply mafuyu 20 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. I’m honestly not familiar with how they’re structured for hardware contracts like this. I was imagining some sort of cost plus structure. No point in speculating on the details of a contract dispute where we don’t have the contract, I suppose. I was under the mistaken understanding that EE was not paid out at all. Rereading their statement, they say they were partially paid, so I think I was overly harsh. This is firmly in “boring, messy contract dispute” territory now, I’d say. :) reply thelittleone 12 hours agorootparentprevIts not uncommon for a contract and SOW to include an hourly rate for approved out of scope items. reply tptacek 12 hours agorootparentYes. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31526196 I'm guessing that's not what they did, though, since DEF CON comes right out and says they submitted bad-faith invoices. That's a factual, falsifiable claim, and a commercially damaging, actionable claim if it's false. reply firesteelrain 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat kind of contract was it? If it’s cost plus you sure can reply minkles 20 hours agorootparentprevClearly you've never worked on a government project!

Blanket statements about billing for government and non-government contracts are not accurate. reply ipaddr 6 hours agorootparentWhy not share some facts. A blanket statement about blanket statements is something a bot would do. reply mlyle 20 hours agoparentprevDEF CON's response reeks of petty; characterizing dmitry as a \"subcontractor\" rather than a volunteer for spin purposes, and the choice to remove Entropic's logo from the case based on this budget dispute. reply echoangle 19 hours agorootparentI think the point of calling Dmitry a subcontractor was to make clear that dmitry worked for/with EE, not DEF CON. reply mjw1007 19 hours agorootparentBut surely DEF CON know that isn't true, because Dmitry evidently provided them with the firmware after the \"stop work\" order to EE (otherwise it couldn't have included the easter egg). reply echoangle 18 hours agorootparentThat’s a good point. From reading DEF CONs statement again, I could imagine that they would claim they issued the stop work order and then got delivery of the current state, which then included the Easter egg. That’s the only way I can come up with where this makes sense. It’s also not clear to me if DEF CON really got the firmware from dmitry or if he gave the firmware to EE which then delivered it together with everything else to DEF CON. reply Aeolun 17 hours agorootparentIf he was working on the firmware until the moment of his flight to Defcon, then clearly they were happy to continue taking his time and effort for free. This also seems to be implied by Entropic, which say they did work on the badge after DEF CON stopped paying them for it. reply rasz 16 hours agoparentprev>You can’t just cut out the contractors labor costs after the fact. Its not after the fact, thats exactly what Stop-Work Order was for. reply bjornsing 10 hours agorootparentEE claims that DEF CON does not want to pay up until the stop-work order though. So it seems to be at least a bit “after the fact”. reply mmastrac 23 hours agoprevThere's basically three sides to the story now, for reference: Entropic statement: https://www.entropicengineering.com/defcon-32-statement dmitrygr statement: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41207469 dmitrygr being removed: https://x.com/dmitrygr/status/1822124650547257637 reply simpaticoder 22 hours agoparentThank you. This stood out to me: \"They expressed that they specifically wanted to work with us as a woman-owned, queer- and POC-driven engineering firm to develop an electronic badge with a gaming element for this year’s conference.\" I would have expected the core criteria to be ability to execute on time. Choosing an engineering firm based on the race, gender, or sexual orientation of the owner is foolish, and DEF CON is ultimately to blame for introducing superfluous criteria and missing the core criteria. reply jhaand 4 hours agorootparentDEFCON did not do proper estimation, risk analysis and due diligence with ordering these badges. Also if the cat design and other things were done by the Defcon orga and the electronics by EE, then this already sounds like a complicated mess. If I look at the Defcon30 badge from 2022. It's the same thing. A small random engineering shop is selected and gets the order. And you get a nice little badge that can do stuff. For the Dutch hacker camps we look a bit more long term and the engineers and designers have been part of the core team since 2017. And for 2025 we're already well underway. https://badge.team reply zavec 40 minutes agorootparentI'm definitely going to have to look into these Dutch events, not only did Defcon feel like much less value for money this year (and all the badge drama) but the Netherlands is way easier for me to get to as well. reply jhaand 6 minutes agorootparentThe Dutch event is WHY2025. https://why2025.org There's a nice overview website with all the events around The Netherlands. https://hackeropuit.nl/ reply cj 22 hours agorootparentprevThat sentence seems like the most irrelevant part of all of what I’ve read. They could have easily rephrased that sentence to simply say “They expressed interest in working with us” and the point they’re making is the same. reply echoangle 21 hours agorootparentIsn’t the implication of the sentence that they were chosen specifically for those properties and wouldn’t have been chosen otherwise? reply superb_dev 21 hours agorootparentThe implication is that they were chosen because of that, but not that this was the only qualification. It could easily be that multiple teams looked qualified during bidding for the job and that this was the distinguishing factor. reply simpaticoder 20 hours agorootparentnext [3 more] [flagged] Dylan16807 19 hours agorootparent> No other qualification was mentioned.

Now, the fact that OP noted it as interesting is not completely without merit.

Most people I see reacting emotionally appear to be opposed to even mentioning that. reply firesteelrain 4 hours agorootparentTo those sympathetic to awarding contracts to those with that societal lean. It’s irrelevant to their ability to perform a contract for DEFCON. If that was never mentioned it would have never been a point at all. If it was meant to be a point then it can make people think that those with that societal lean are poor performers. It’s not helping their cause. reply ipaddr 5 hours agorootparentprevThis makes DEF CON look foolish and past it's prime. You would think technical requirements would be the only criteria used but I guess they wanted this project to make political gains with a certain community instead of just making badges. reply mindslight 2 hours agorootparentprevIn 2024, that statement doesn't really indicate much of anything. Traditionally, interfacing with the business world involved retaining an underemployed white guy who would wax poetic about the virtues of playing golf [0] or owning a boat.

[0] the boring version without moving obstacles, PVC pipes, or fiberglass dinosaurs - further adding insult to injury reply foundry27 19 hours agorootparentprevIt’s concerning to me that this has been downvoted so heavily. Obviously as a private group DEF CON’s organizers have every right to contract with whatever companies they want to. In the same way, obviously the private individuals paying DEF CON’s organizers have every right to criticize them when they treat their contractors so poorly. However , I think it’s short-sighted and self-defeating to suggest that they shouldn’t ALSO have the right to criticize their choice of companies they work with when it impacts the quality of what they’re paying for. This is not a sexist, anti-POC, or anti-trans criticism. Deciding on contractors for the reasons they claimed they did would be illegal in the public sector under France’s anti-discrimination laws, under Germany’s Grundgesetz, under Japan’s GPA, under the UK’s Equality Act in many cases, etc. reply the__alchemist 5 hours agorootparentIn the US Federal contract system, these preferences are formalized; has been for decades. It's a heavily-exploited game by those who play by its rules. Basic classes are \"Service disabled veteran owned\" \"minority owned\" \"women owned\" etc. I think \"veteran owned\" counts a bit too. reply akira2501 18 hours agorootparentprevThere are _much_ better ways to help the causes of Women, People of Color, or People of Different Sexual Orientations then making it a criteria of who you happen to create small one time contracts with. reply lnxg33k1 15 hours agorootparentprev>> Obviously as a private group DEF CON’s organizers have every right to contract with whatever companies they want to.

Has there been anything in all this that would suggest anyone was in danger at the conference? This kind of comment about safety is pretty standard among very progressive communities anytime anyone disagrees with them. reply cdchn 18 hours agorootparent>Has there been anything in all this that would suggest anyone was in danger at the conference? Depends on how much you danger you consider someone making unwanted physical contact and restraining your movements. reply wang_li 17 hours agorootparentI don't consider you trespassing and the people who have the authority to remove you removing you as danger. Additionally, it's arguable he gave permission when they told him to leave or they'd remove him and he told them to remove him. reply cdchn 2 hours agorootparentI'd consider a bunch of untrained goons giving me the bum's rush a danger regardless of the circumstances. reply sergiotapia 22 hours agoparentprevtldr: entropic made some mistakes because they're a small team with a very tight deadline. defcon shit the bed and refused to pay them over those problems. and dmitry forgot about an easter egg and was OK with being removed from speaking, but wanted security to pull him off stage for his clout. I still think DEFCON should've done better. their brand is in the shitter over what $20k? reply ryandrake 22 hours agorootparentReading both accounts of the story, it sounds like a small company bit off more than it could chew, couldn’t manage cost and schedule, and when it got to the drop-dead date, even though they say it was basically done (how many times did the client hear that one), the client pulled the plug and tried to salvage it some other way. Y’all need project managers, at least someone with a plan! jeez. reply michaelt 20 hours agorootparent> Y’all need project managers, at least someone with a plan! jeez. Or do what every other event does, and don't make your badges so complicated they need a project manager Every other event has badges that look like they cost substantially less than $1. I'm not saying they have to go that cheap - but when you're hiring a project manager to coordinate the multiple teams, schedule challenges, and providers biting off more than they can chew? Maybe scale things back a bit. reply firesteelrain 20 hours agorootparentThey tried last year with the injection molded plastic part that you could mod and didn’t get enough of them shipped in time. To your point on $1 badges, they gave paper out and people complained (and still complain) for a long time. They felt they spent $300-400 plus travel expenses so they have this idea they should get a special badge. It has an entire culture around it. Me and a partner designed an insert that fit into that injection molded part and it had games. You could even connect via RS232 if you had the right board and it would print out DEFCON in ASCII then it had whole menu of games. We sold this add on for $20 at cost to recoup our costs. Sold about 100+ of these add ons. DEFCON definitely bit off more than they could chew. We designed our add on around a cheap STM32 series chip and wrote the code ourselves in C. It didn’t have an emulator like this as this is like an entire gaming platform that DEFCON created. But ours was more like DOS level game add on that took us a couple months to make and have produced. We made the stickers ourselves and cut acrylic ourselves. reply Dylan16807 19 hours agorootparentprevIf you take this situation and make the circuit boards not be the badge, it doesn't really change the situation much. There's a little bit less pressure if the badge is separate, but I'm sure an emergency backup badge could have been arranged. If you're saying not to have a cool gizmo at all, I think that's too harsh of a lesson. reply kelnos 14 hours agorootparentprevFrom what I understand, the DEFCON badges are a fun thing they like to do every year. I don't see this as a problem; what is a problem is deciding to try to create something so complicated in under eight months. I get that it might be a heavy lift for them to start planning and engaging companies to work on the DEFCON '24 badge before DEFCON '23 had even happened, but this particular badge warrants a year-plus of lead time. reply tptacek 12 hours agorootparentIf that's the case, a competent vendor should not have signed contracts committing themselves to deliver it. reply jhaand 4 hours agorootparentIt could even be that EE was not the first engineering firm contacted by Defcon. But they were the ones that said yes to this product. reply dfox 20 hours agorootparentprevI suspect that the comment implies the absence of project manager on the Entropic side of the deal. As for the cost of the badge, sourcing even sub-$1 badge is still a project. And especially when your target audience is somewhat skilled at counterfeiting such things. reply echoangle 1 hour agorootparentIs the badge the actual thing that lets you enter? Why don’t they just have digital tickets that get scanned at the entrance like everyone else? Does the badge need to be hard to counterfeit? reply bawolff 14 hours agorootparentprevI mean, its defcon's money, if they want to spend it on fancy badges, that is there right. If someone offers to do something, knowing full well what the requirements are, but can't, that is not defcon's fault but the people who agreed to do the badges. reply A4ET8a8uTh0 21 hours agorootparentprevI think I agree with the assessment. Especially the part about PM hits close to home. It seems how a lot of projects I was involved lately lacked an actual project manager. Is the problem that it is a hard job to do right? reply theshrike79 21 hours agorootparentThe thing is that people on here think project managers are evil incarnate and just useless middle management. It requires a very specific skill set to be able to lead a technical project and cut through the bullshit on BOTH SIDES: the client asking for features and the team building the product. Clients always either ask for stuff they don't really need or have vague requirements that crystallise only 3 days after the deadline. \"Of course when we said it needs to do foo, it also MUST do bar, doh!\" And teams tend to overestimate their ability to deliver and underestimate the work needed to get to the finish. (Infinite coast problem). reply q7xvh97o2pDhNrh 21 hours agorootparentThere's also several more classes of B.S., for what it's worth. An exaggerated/anonymized version of a recent one I got, from an otherwise-really-strong senior engineer: \"Of course when I said we would put a button there, it also meant we MUST build an entire UI framework from scratch, with full test coverage for the entire thing!\" ...actually, that's not even that exaggerated. Shipping software at big companies can be unreasonably difficult, sometimes. reply hnthrowaway0315 16 hours agorootparentprevGood project managers are rare. They need to have some real experiences working on some projects and then some managing projects. It's rarer than good engineering managers IMO. reply fragmede 21 hours agorootparentprevIt's actually really hard to do well. Moreover, it suffers from \"how hard could it really be\" syndrome, especially when working with developers who think they're smarter than everybody. It's the kind of job that a software developer approches from first principals and does a terrible job at, because starting from first principals ignores all of humanity's experience and practice managing projects, and projects have existed since before the Great Pyramids in Egypt. We have better tools today, but it takes a skilled practitioner to wield them well. Yes I'm talking about Jira and I hate sitting down and pointing things too, but managing a large complex project with a large number of humans is real actual work and a full time job in and of itself. sometimes even more than one person can handle. places that I've seen are successful are able to recognize that, and don't treat it as dead weight. reply viccis 22 hours agorootparentprev>dmitry forgot about an easter egg Ah yes, classic \"insert an unauthorized coin wallet soliciting money from badge owners\" easter egg. Timeless prank, how could anyone be mad at such a normal and anodyne \"easter egg\"? lmao DEFCON's \"brand\" isn't in any danger. edit: And now he's pulling the classic hacker move of (checks notes) enforcing strict software IP ownership rights?

It seems perfectly in line with the ‘shareware’ and ‘buy me a cup of coffee’ spirit that characterized the early years. reply bawolff 14 hours agorootparentGenerally you dont make secret shareware out of software you make for other people. Just imagine what would happen if you created a shareware scene in the software of some company you work for. You would get fired (and possibly sued) so fast it would make your head spin. reply Rebelgecko 16 minutes agorootparentMy understanding is that Dmitry was a volunteer.

Doing it as counterplay to a lack of credit is a great hack. reply josephg 20 hours agorootparentprevHe wasn’t employed by anyone, and didn’t get paid by anyone for his work. (Defcon is wrong about this in their statement, and admitted as such in the comment thread). When I write code that nobody is paying for, you better believe I’ll write it how I damn well please. If you aren’t paying, you aren’t the customer. And you don’t get to control the output of my work. The wallet address soliciting donations is for the hardware company, not on his own behalf. But even if it was on his own behalf, would you still be mad? Since when is it a crime to be proud of the code you’ve written, for free, to bring joy to an hacker conference? That deserves mad credit in my book. reply bawolff 14 hours agorootparent> When I write code that nobody is paying for, you better believe I’ll write it how I damn well please. You're under no obligation to write code. You are under an obligation not to sneak an advert into someone else's conference via essentially fraudulent means. Just because nobody is paying you, doesn't mean you have carte blanche to do whatever you want. I dont think this is a controversial opinion. If someone created a piece of open source software but hid a trojan or cryptominer in it people would find it objectionable. You could quibble about where the line is, but i think everyone agrees that just because something is free does not give you the absolute right to do whatever you want. reply ipaddr 5 hours agorootparentYou can't hide something in open source code for those who audit what they use. You can for those who just install without reviewing. reply josephg 9 hours agorootparentprevIts not an ad. It was a request for donations to a company that put themselves out to the tune of $100k to make the badges happen. And then had credit and publicity stripped from them during defcon - even though that was part of the deal! Apparently they aren't even mentioned in the program, and their company logo was taken off the cases for the badges. We aren't talking about client work here.

Secretly putting an ad into software that you know will be distributed to many people is the oldest scumbag move in the scumbag book. All sympathy ended there, and that was weeks before he trespassed. reply kelnos 14 hours agorootparentCharacterizing it as an \"ad\" feels a bit dishonest, as if it was an ad for some random product completely unrelated to the conference or the badges themselves. It was a shout-out to the company that made the badges! And that after DEFCON promised to give that company credit on the badge case, and then reneged on that promise. Even if Entropic shat the bed so badly that DEFCON's takeover of badge production was actually warranted (I'm super skeptical of this claim), the badges still consisted nearly entirely of Entropic's & Dmitry's work. DEFCON's removal of credit from the badge case was deeply unethical. reply josephg 18 hours agorootparentprevEh. When I was young, I played a demo of Doom that came with a magazine. When you finish the demo level, the game show an ad that said if I ponied up money, I could play the whole game. I fail to see the problem. And in this case it wasn’t an ad. It was a page saying you could donate to the hardware company if you want, who were out of pocket $100k for making the hardware.

You can't let someone rock up to the stage uninvited. This would open the door to all kinds of issues. And the original question of how the situation could have been handled better is the most interesting one. The rest is a game of he said/she said, which hn commenters tend to enjoy arguing about but is ultimately not very instructive. With hindsight it is clear that the situation had been brewing for some time, and the conflict had been escalating slowly. Perhaps due to the pressure and stress (and time pressure) of organising an event like that nobody managed to have enough distance to deescalate it, which culminated in someone being escorted off stage by security, not a good experience for anyone. Most likely once the invitation to talk had been rescinded the dice were thrown. It would have been hard for the speaker not to be offended, and unfair on him to expect him to take it quietly and move on without reacting. Someone should have been aware of that and worked with him to control the impact of this on his own reputation. reply ibash 15 hours agorootparentprevHe was given a 30 minute notice that he was disinvited. That’s pretty egregious. Especially since they were okay with him giving the talk as long as he apologized. And he offered to say “I didn’t mean to offend anyone”. So for a misunderstanding and mistake to drag him off the stage is stupid and ridiculous. > What should they have done better? They didn't have the option of doing better with Dmitry, right?

Did you mean “what could they have done better once he was at the stage?” reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentI got locked in a hotel room by an actual goon who demanded a line-item veto of my slides (clients! what you'll do to keep clients happy!), and ask Mike Lynn how he feels about the response to his talk.

They made the software for the badge of your entire conference, for free, and then you won’t let them talk about it because what you got for free, wasn’t what you expected/wanted? That’s just dumb on so many levels I don’t even know where to begin. It’s like playing, no, selling someone elses mod and complaining it’s not up to the standards of a finished game. reply tptacek 17 hours agorootparentThey absolutely do get to do that. Absolutely, and without qualification. It's their stage. There's a whole long history of this with DC/BH. reply kelnos 14 hours agorootparentI don't think GP meant \"don't get to\" as in it's not their legal right to do so (which of course it is). I think they meant that it's a profoundly shitty thing to do to someone, and DEFCON should rightly be criticized for disinviting him in the first place. I think an easter egg that includes a monetary solicitation is (at best) in poor taste, regardless of the circumstances. But canceling his talk 30 minutes prior to its start time for that? Nope, not cool. DEFCON's behavior in disinviting him was much much worse than his action that triggered it. reply bawolff 14 hours agorootparentprev> They made the software for the badge of your entire conference, for free, and then you won’t let them talk about it because what you got for free, wasn’t what you expected/wanted? You are saying this like it is unreasonable, but it seems entirely reasonable to me. Just because you do something for free does not entitile you to a conference talk about it. If you wanted to be paid for it (and make no mistake, a conference talk is a form of compensation. In many conferences companies pay huge sums of money to have a platform) then they should have got a contract. reply josephg 20 hours agorootparentprevIt was a huge mistake to uninvite him from the session. It sounds like defcon was mad at EE for going over budget - which honestly is fair even though they didn’t handle it well. And thought (wrongly) that Dmitry was a salty subcontractor of theirs. Their actions make some sense in that context. Not great, but eh. But Dmitry has totally owned them in messaging - by forcing them to physically eject him (making a scene), and getting out ahead of the story. It’s great drama. He’s positioned defcon to look like an evil corporate buffoon hating on a hacker who was just donating his time. At this point, defcon should take the L and apologise, and let him have a session talking about the code. That would be a very satisfying end to the drama for attendees. (Even if it does encourage more drama in future years.) Either way, I agree - I’m sure attendance will go up next year too. People love this stuff. reply garaetjjte 5 hours agorootparentIt's not that letting him do the talk would be any better for defcon, given that he literally said he will present these \"easter eggs\". >PS: there are a few easter eggs in the stock badge firmware, try to find them or come to the badge talk at DEFCON to see for yourself ;) reply tptacek 20 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds to me like they were mad at Dmitry for including an \"easter egg\" in their badge firmware that solicited donations to a Bitcoin address. reply Dylan16807 19 hours agorootparentIt was definitely an easter egg. A secret screen that gives credit to someone that worked on a thing and otherwise wouldn't get credit is the textbook example of an easter egg. It probably shouldn't have had the Bitcoin address, but it doesn't sound like that would have been treated much differently. reply tptacek 19 hours agorootparentI think you're going to find that firms who contract embedded designs have viewpoints about \"easter eggs\" that would be surprising, even off-putting, to message board communities that savor them like single malts. Generally, when firms arrange to deliver hardware/software to their own customers sourced from vendors, they want a clear understanding of what the software actually does. reply josephg 18 hours agorootparentYep. But again, it’s really not clear in this case if DEFCON was paying their vendor (EE) for software at all. I can see how it was ambiguous from their side given Dimitri was friends with the hardware design company. But from the POV of Dimitri and EE, DEFCON was paying for hardware and a separate 3rd party (Dimitri) volunteered to write the software. It’s very spicy to attack people in your community who volunteer their time. And unpaid programmers doing cheeky things with code because they want to is the heart of DEFCON. I can see where DEFCON is coming from with the calls they made here. But it’s a mistake to treat Dimitri as if he were a vendor.

(I'm thinking about civil and criminal liability.) reply metadat 21 hours agorootparentIt's a private event on private property. There is no inherent right to be there, especially up on stage without invitation (TFA mentions this was what happened). reply neilv 21 hours agorootparentI'm wondering how the organizers of an event cover all the bases sufficiently on something like that. I'm asking out of curiosity about how that actually works, in practice, not what arguments we could imagine. (For example: Say, someone rushes up on stage during a rock music concert. Was removal covered in the fine print terms of the ticket? Are the security personnel deputized by local law enforcement? Are there special ordinances applying to security at some kinds of events? Do the event organizers fall back on the claim that they felt safety was threatened? Do the event organizers think any risk of penalties or lawsuit is less than the cost of disrupting the event? Does setting precedent for response also factor into the calculus? How is insurance and venue contracts involved? Etc. There's a some related history, involving the Hell's Angels at a concert, but I don't know how practice has evolved since then.) reply NegativeK 20 hours agorootparentHell no they're not deputized. America relevant: It's similar to security anywhere, including \"loss prevention\" at a grocery store. They can tell you to leave, and if you don't, they can physically remove you from the property. That's pretty well established. It also applies to kicking someone out of your house that doesn't have a right to be there. If they hurt you inappropriately (there's a wide range between a trespasser bruising their fist on a guard's face and a guard holding someone down and pummeling them for no reason), they've committed a crime and might lose a civil lawsuit. Some places won't let guards touch trespassers. Other places lean on discretion and the training they've given to the guard, the cameras they have spammed everywhere, etc. The removal is usually covered in something like \"we have the right to kick you out at any time, even if you paid.\" That doesn't cover all bases, but it covers a lot. If you never signed a contract with a venue, the removal is covered by the fact that you have zero intrinsic right to be there. For more examples, you can look at casinos in Vegas trespassing people. If you act out of line or gamble in a way they don't like (like successfully counting cards at blackjack,) they'll boot you. They might spread your name to other casinos if they really don't like you. And if you enter one again, it's criminal trespass. They can do it for anything that isn't legally protected. reply digi59404 16 hours agorootparentThis isn’t 100% true. Security in Nevada and California are licensed and have what’s known as “powers to arrest”. They can not grab you and physically remove you. This is called battery and it’s illegal. You can actually be charged with a crime as a security officer for this. Along with fined and lose your license. What actually happens is them physically restraining you is a form of citizens arrest. They then hold you and call police to take you. The issue with trespassing is it can only be charged if the individual continually refuses to leave. This means the moment they choose to leave, you must let them. If in the act of being arrested they fight or assault people. They can be arrested for that. If they are violating the peace or committing another crime, they can be arrested for that. However if it’s SOLELY trespassing. The moment they agree to leave; you need to let them leave. The casinos do have police officers inside them and some security officers ARE deputized. A security officer can have powers to arrest as a security officer and powers to arrest as a police officer. They are entirely different things and have different levels of responsibility and liability. reply lukan 20 hours agorootparentprevI only know german law from a short time as a security, but I assume it is quite similar: Cops do not want to be called for every bouncer action. The owner (or the one renting the property) has legal rights and set the rules. You break the rules, by beeing somewhere you are not supposed to be - any staff member can act as security to physically remove you. They may not beat you, though. Or otherwise act escalating. But forcefully leading (or carrying) out someone breaking the house rules (by using minimum of violence) is legal and standard procesure on every big event. reply kelnos 14 hours agorootparentprev> Say, someone rushes up on stage during a rock music concert. Was removal covered in the fine print terms of the ticket? Certainly, and usually in broad terms, like \"event security may remove any person from the premises for any reason they believe is necessary to ensure the security and safety of the event\". Once designated agents of the owners of the venue have told you to leave, you are illegally trespassing if you stay. reply tptacek 22 hours agoprevI believe DEF CON on this, because the other side of the story --- that they vindictively withheld payment from Entropic and later harassed the firmware developer --- just doesn't make any sense. We are probably talking about rounding error sums of money for the conference organizers themselves. reply InsideOutSanta 22 hours agoparentI think the issue is that they got used to pulling a rabbit out of a hat with their badges. The budget they have for them is apparently ridiculously low, and it seems like sheer luck that it somehow worked out in the past. At some point, defcon must have confused luck with skill. Meanwhile, others paid the price for that by working \"for exposure.\" This year, it blew up in everybody's faces. Whose fault is it? Defcon, for having unrealistic budgets?

When your project blows up, the professional thing to do is to resolve the problem with the client before billing another hour over the SOW. The common, crazy thing to do instead is optimistic invoicing: the client must share our priors, we're all reasonable people, so we'll just implicitly revise the SOW to match our learnings on this project and proceed, prioritizing what we believe would be a successful delivery of the project over everything else. That rarely works.

DEFCON’s Badge Team remained confident that they could meet and mitigate this risk. > Once a month, we billed for our work and submitted an updated estimated per badge final cost - committing as costs built to discount our work as necessary in order to hit DEFCON’s per unit cost targets. > In June, after 5 months of late night work, badges were fully designed, prototypes were working, and mass production was ongoing with the manufacturers we contracted on behalf of DEFCON. We billed DEFCON for our most recent work, discounting our labor by 25% in order to meet the agreed upon targets. Unfortunately, we were instead met with a work stoppage request and informed we would no longer be paid for services already rendered. https://www.entropicengineering.com/defcon-32-statement It feels to me like DEFCON is relying on being able to say \"well, we're DEFCON\" when defending themselves, and people like you are just blindly trusting their word. How many times have big organizations like this screwed their suppliers? And yet DEFCON is \"clearly\" innocent? You must be joking.

Isn't that a falsifiable statement that contradicts Defcon? reply Aeolun 17 hours agorootparentThey also said they didn’t take into account anything outside the board, because only Defcon had access to that data. It’s perfectly possible for Entropic to be calculating to a $100k total cost (for the board), while Defcon is calculating the cost for everything (case/lanyard, etc.), and gets to $160k for the entire project, then says they’re 60% over budget. I imagine Entropic was discounting their bills to say within the 100K, while Defcon already felt they were over. (Numbers made up) reply numpad0 12 hours agorootparentInjection molds for that nice clear case can't be cheap too. Has four parts, clips, undercuts, and not tiny. They're not making that shell for under $100k total at any volume. reply jdnsndn 10 hours agorootparentI didn't see the case, so this is speculation based in my knowledge with injection molding. A fairly simple mold costs 5-10k, a complex mold 10-20k. Since this is a limited production run, I would argue that they didn't need the highest tolerances. Thus my guess would be ~$50k for the molds and ~$5 for the parts. reply numpad0 10 hours agorootparentI was mistaken about parts count, it's just front and back.

This doesn't really add up to me. Ultimately we'll never know for sure. Personally I'm inclined to believe Entropic more on this one (though I'm sure neither party is blame-free, regardless of where the bulk of fault lies), but I can see why you'd be more inclined to trust DEFCON's response.

There's no particular ceremony to \"stop work\". reply mvdtnz 18 hours agorootparentprevEntropic's statements have been really vague but I don't think they \"discounted\" anything. They couldn't charge their full labour cost because they had a signed SOW. So they may have put in more hours than estimated and weren't able to bill their usual hourly rate, but that's why we have SOWs - to protect the clients in the case of overages.

And: > We billed DEFCON for our most recent work, discounting our labor by 25% in order to meet the agreed upon targets. So it sounds like they were billing with an expected total of $200k, not anything higher.

The badge manufacturing issue and subsequent non-payment due to contract dispute. 2. The firmware author (not hired by the manufacturer) put in unauthorized 'easter egg' code that asks for money via crypto. I am not familiar with 1 so I can't comment on a contract dispute. But 2 is definitely over the line, and this is coming from me who is supportive of some usage of cryptocurrency. You don't put in unexpected monetization mechanisms into your volunteer work, without asking the charity organization for permission. Asking for money secretly is way different than putting in a harmless Easter egg. At that point, it's not a harmless easter egg anymore. Maybe the money is for the manufacturer. In that case, do what a normal person would do and raise the issue on a social channel (eg. Twitter, Thread, blog). reply kelnos 13 hours agoparent> Maybe the money is for the manufacturer. Yes, it was for the manufacturer, not for the firmware author himself. I agree that he shouldn't have put in the donation solicitation, but I think DEFCON's response to kick him out of his talk was an overreaction. Especially considering what prompted the easter egg was DEFCON removing the Entropic's badge credit from the badge case that they were promised. Even if DEFCON's statement about the manufacturing/cost issues with the badge (your point 1) was entirely true, the final badge that ended up in attendees' hands was still almost completely Entropic's and Dmitry's work, and they deserve credit for putting together something of that complexity in such a short time frame. No one is coming out of this looking perfectly rosy, regardless of the truth behind things. The donation link was over the line, but DEFCON's change to the badge case was completely unethical, and disinviting Dmitry from the badge talk over an inappropriate easter egg was a dirty thing to do. reply xyst 19 hours agoprevI have read all accounts and points of view. Defcon clearly dropped the ball here. Whoever was managing this badge creation team should never be allowed near defcon again.

Not super familiar with Nevada law. (Obviously doing crowd control, providing information, and front line emergency response is absolutely fine, although tbh even that they should probably have guard cards in most jurisdictions for liability reasons.

Given this complexity and confusion, short of conducting a full court trial with months of document subpoenas and depositions under oath, IMHO, confidently believing you've arrived at a complete, objective understanding of who is right or wrong is as likely to be incorrect as it is correct. And, at this point, this probably holds true for most of the actual participants too. I base this on decades of experience untangling screwed up business transactions and communications. No matter how thorough, credible and complete a certain retelling seems, I've often discovered there is another layer (sometimes even unknown to many of those involved) which changes enough to shift whatever I initially believed.

Dmitry and Entropic had already been working on a GB emulator and were thrilled to be able to contribute our work to a project directly for and by the community. [0] Despite the project being \"impossible,\" EE made some sort of agreement to complete the work and deliver within time and budget. EE, not DC, made the decision to work with Dmitry. > I am not a subcontractor of anyone. I was doing this in my own free time for fun so attendees have a fun badge. There exist no contracts between me and anyone. It was an evenings-and-weekends project for me [1] This work by Dmitry was unpaid, presumed: uninvoiced and not under contract directly with DF, and is not an agent of ES. > While we as a company did not ask Dmitry to program the easter egg, the outpouring of support and community for EE has been appreciated and inspiring. [0] EE did not request the Easter egg be included by Dmitry. As a free agent (not under contract) Dmitry is free to do as they wish. Dmitry's involvement with DF was an invitation to participate on a panel. Given the discovery of the Easter egg, DF withdrew the invitation. Without any explicit agreement, it is irrelevant as to why DF would withdraw their invitation as it is presumed DF can withdraw any such privileges at anytime for any reason, though a reason was given in the case. > At this point, all work had been completed except our physically attending the overseas production run and providing ongoing troubleshooting/debugging. In fact, the day we received this surprising news, we were actively working on the SD card debug that became a central concern earlier this week. [0] This sounds consistent with DF's claim that the product was still in pre-production and all services had not yet fully been rendered, therefore, the original agreement may already have been breached at this point. What is \"owed,\" is likely no longer stipulated under the main clauses of the contract. > EE has tried multiple times over the past months to negotiate fair compensation for work completed prior to June 7th, but attempts at resolution have been unsuccessful. [0] > Once a month, we billed for our work and submitted an updated estimated per badge final cost - committing as costs built to discount our work as necessary in order to hit DEFCON’s per unit cost targets. [0] > Once the manufacturing was fully completed, we were offered a one-time “take it or leave it” amount worth well under half of what we were owed pre-stoppage. Given that what we were owed was already discounted by 25% in order to hit agreed upon cost targets, this has had a huge impact on our small team. [0] > We have also continued to pour lots of time, effort, and love into the project post-stoppage. I want to be clear that we never expected to be paid for this post-stoppage work, but simply did it as a labor of love for the community. [0] This is contract dispute. What EE is \"owed\" is defined (or should be defined) in the agreement. What is \"invoiced,\" despite any \"discount\", does not, on its own, constitute what is owed by DF. Unbilled and discounted labor significantly complicates this, especially if it was not itemized as such on the invoices sent to DF. Parts and materials, which come with invoices attached, should be paid per the agreement. > Any claims that DEF CON did not pay Entropic Engineering for its hardware or firmware development are false.[OP source] My assumption is the agreement was for a fixed-cost fixed-timeline per-badge payment and the targets were not met, despite EE trying their best. The claims made by both sides are verifiable by receipts and, should it come to that, can be arbitrated either by a court of law or the court of PR (public relations, ie, the internet). Regarding Dmitry's experience and the Easter egg, for better or worse, DF can make whatever decision they please at their conference. The Easter egg was antagonistic towards DF and is significantly unrelated to the payment dispute with EE. The Easter egg being a \"prank\" or \"difficult to find\" or \"not technically owned by DF,\" is also unrelated (although the code seems to be part of services rendered to DF by the agreement with EE [0]). > We were clear as early as our first conversation in January that the risk in trying to push to mass production of this size and on this timeline was immense, even advocating for a DEFCON 2025 release of this particular badge. DEFCON’s Badge Team remained confident that they could meet and mitigate this risk. [0] EE' admissions illustrates that DF's decision to push forward with this vendor was ill-advised. Given their experience, it would have been charitable to not put EE in this position. Arguably, DF did mitigate their risk (financial and reputational risk) by issuing a stop order and seeing the product to completion by other means; attendees did get their badges after all. By admission, EE also recognized the risk themselves and continuing their attempt to render the agreement under the circumstances was also ill-advised. Their risk (to reputation) was also managed by providing free labor. This is unrelated to the payment dispute as both parties chose, and were not forced, to continue to engage under the terms of their agreement until such time the agreement was made null. The only dispute is in regards to the original agreement, which should be rendered whole by the terms of the contract that were completed and satisfied by EE.

Upgrading from v1 to v2 was not too difficult and v2 is a significant upgrade with lots of useful features, massively improved codegen experience and support for tokio async were the big gamechangers for me. Writing all the app business logic in Rust and using Dart as the front-end works out really well.

The fear that if Google drops it, it will die are legitimate. reply neonsunset 26 minutes agorootparentprev> Why conflate Google's customer facing products with their OSS technology contributions?

Could you expand on this a bit? My impression was that Flutter and React had relatively similar approaches to components, but I haven't had much experience with Flutter yet, so I'm interested to hear your experiences! reply tmpfs 9 hours agorootparentAt a basic level Flutter renders the entire widget tree and caches components that don't need to re-render rather than applying a diff of changes to the DOM. But it's really the Flutter/Dart API and widgets that make it much easier to work with, if I need to load some data asynchronously I use a `FutureBuilder`, if I need a stream of events I can use `StreamBuilder` etc. Compared to Reacts state, hooks, memo, effects etc. you end up with code that is far easier to reason about what is rendering when and why. Oh and the real killer feature is Flutters hot reload experience, it's easily the best DX I've seen for GUI work. As another comment mentioned it really is like night and day. I recommend giving it a try. reply MrJohz 6 hours agorootparentI don't quite understand the point about rendering, unless you mean it in the Angular sense (i.e. on every state update, the whole app gets rendered, and elements are updated to the new state during that render). But I can imagine that the API can be easier. I think React handles state fairly well, but as soon as that state needs to interact with things outside the React world (http requests, continuously updating data, etc) then the current abstractions don't quite feel right. reply beanjuiceII 4 hours agorootparentreact and flutter are pretty much the same thing, i do both for a living i am not sure what this person is going on about reply nu11ptr 6 hours agorootparentprevReact = one small piece of a very large required ecosystem (HTML + CSS + Javascript + NPM + React + Vite + ???) Flutter = a UI framework for mobile/desktop/web (Flutter + Dart) On top of the purpose built nature, nearly everything is a Widget, even layout/styling making it pretty easy to grok very quickly. reply amelius 6 hours agorootparentI personally prefer using many smaller components over using a large opinionated framework. But I'm not a big fan of React, so this could be better and worth a try. reply tensor 3 hours agorootparentIt's less a \"large opinionated framework\" and more \"fewer components overall. There is no HTML/CSS for example, it goes direct from Dart (equivalent to JS) to the Widget rendering system.\" Dart has its own build tools and package system that work well. You can still pull in dart libraries as you need them. Dart is also a much better language than JS. I can't tell you how many days I've lost to react/JS build tooling issues. A single problem can easily eat an entire day. With flutter/dart I haven't had a single issue like that. reply synergy20 5 hours agorootparentprevflutter does a so so job on desktop and it's web version is wasm based. the job market for dart flutter is a drop while react is the lake. react with electron, react native, react itself together are still the only ones production ready cross platform GUI with widest adoption reply mdhb 3 hours agorootparentcomments about job markets aside… The first and the third paragraphs really haven’t been true for some time now. Flutter is absolutely production ready as a cross platform GUI. reply satvikpendem 9 hours agorootparentprevThey do have similar approaches, I'm not sure what the above commenter is saying as both work basically the same (with React class components at least). Flutter doesn't have hooks but they're addressing that via macros next year, and anyway today there are packages like flutter_hooks and ReArch that enable hook-like functionality in Flutter today. reply mdhb 10 hours agorootparentprevI’m too lazy right now to get into all of the specifics but just wanted to drop a quick note to say that I’ve been doing web development since 1997 and the difference between React and Flutter is like day and night. It’s genuinely hard for me to overstate the general quality of life improvements both from the developer experience and the overall quality of the apps I can produce in any given time frame. A big part of the reason for that is Dart is itself hands down the nicest language I’ve ever worked with. The team behind it got real serious when it comes to tooling and language design and everytime I have to go back to TypeScript I feel like I’m trying to run with a 50kg backpack on. reply satvikpendem 9 hours agoparentprevBut, Flutter and React work the same way where UI is a function of state. In fact, Flutter started off imperatively but after React was released, they changed it to be declarative, and now Android via Jetpack Compose is changing to be declarative, all on the same general principle. I also use packages like flutter_hooks or ReArch which make encapsulating state much easier, I couldn't stand using initState and not forgetting to dispose for each piece of functionality. reply fzyzcjy 12 hours agoparentprevYou are welcome, and happy to hear it works for you! reply nu11ptr 6 hours agoparentprev> I know Flutter/Dart doesn't get much love here on HN but in my opinion I think it's much easier to reason about than a system like React which I think is the wrong level of abstraction compared to Flutter's render the entire widget tree approach. Yeah I really like Flutter/Dart. I had less an issue with React itself than I did the whole HTML/CSS/Javascript ecosystem and tooling. Flutter is a breath of fresh air in that it is a purpose built ecosystem for UIs. You load the SDK and are ready to go with features like hot reload out of the box. No need for gamut of tools and to figure out how they all work together. Also, no need for HTML + CSS! I think the only reason it isn't more popular is because we have such a huge # of frontend devs already trained on HTML/CSS/JS, as Flutter is a lot simpler out of the gate, and much easier for traditional GUI paradigm people IMO. reply samstave 2 hours agoparentprevJust want to say, your site is very aesthetically pleasing.

The work fzyzcjy and the community have put into calling Rust code from Dart seamlessly is such an asset to Flutter apps. I remade the popular image compression app ImageOptim in Flutter over a weekend because webp wasn't supported. After a little pain in the initial setup, I was able to call mature Rust image libraries using flutter_rust_bridge and a small wrapper[0]. It even handled all the parallelism for me. The app ended up being more capable and faster than ImageOptim, largely just because of the Rust integration. Thank you fzyzcjy!

When I initially develop flutter_rust_bridge, my personal usage scenario is quite similar to yours: using Rust for some high performance algorithms. reply danielvaughn 4 hours agoprevNice, I really enjoyed Flutter's approach to building UI, but I didn't really care for Dart all that much. In theory shouldn't it be possible to create a programming language specifically for UI? Something that can be interfaced with from any major programming language. Kinda like protobuf with its IDL format, but instead of defining data, it's declaring user interfaces. Is that a crazy or stupid idea? QT and XAML come to mind, but I believe QT is closed source (might be wrong about that), and XAML seems to have been dead in the water for a long time now (also might be wrong about that). reply Tmpod 30 minutes agoparentQt has some commercial license only components, but the majority is open-source. In fact, the KDE Free Qt Foundation ensures that the framework is always available under GPL+LGPLv3.[0] Anyway, there are some languages specifically desgined for making UIs. Qt has one of those, QML[1]. It's a \"simple\" language made precisely for UI development, that can be wired to C++, allowing you to write business logic in a general language, while keeping UI focused. More interestingly, though, is Slint[2]. The language (and company behind it) was made by ex-QML devs which sought to improve the design, avoiding some pitfalls that QML ended up running into. It's core is written in Rust, but there are bindings for C++, JS and now Python too. They also have a focus on embedded devices, which ends up translating to always having good performance and memory footprint in mind, which is neat.

I’m currently using Tauri for a project myself and was wondering if anyone has any pros/cons between the two? reply bobajeff 4 hours agoparentFrom what I can tell. I've not used Tauri and it's been years since I've tried flutter. Tauri currently has poor support for mobile and Linux (because of the state of WebkitGtk). Flutter uses Dart which is not widely used for anything else. Harder to learn as there is no MDN, w3schools or standard spec for it. Also Flutter Web has issues due to it's use of Canvas over the DOM. IMO, electron is still the way to go for cross platform apps. reply fzyzcjy 11 hours agoparentprevThank you! I heard some people saying that, for apps using JavaScript, Tauri is replacing Electron and is popular nowadays, since Electron is very widely used. It seems Tauri cannot let Rust communicate with JavaScript very seamlessly yet, e.g. https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/command/ seems to have mainly basic features. oneshtein mentioned below that Tauri does not support mobile as first class citizen yet as well. Looking forward to seeing Tauri's bridge to improve and supporting mobile better in the future! reply bubblebeard 10 hours agorootparentThanks for the info! I will keep an eye on this for future projects, keen to try it out. I’m currently working on a project being converted from Electron to Rust/Tauri.

I'd say it's very good, easy to build in on widget by widget basis, very easy to check and rest when running builds. reply nu11ptr 6 hours agoprevI use Flutter for my desktop UI and Rust for my backend. However, I chose to separate the two using gRPC instead of the bridge. This allows me to be agnostic of language on both sides and I suspect gives me a cleaner interface for mocking the backend from my frontend. It also makes it easy to place the UI and backend on different machines giving a true client/server architecture. The con is likely that the interface is probably more verbose, however. reply nevi-me 6 hours agoparentDo you run a gRPC service on the desktop where the UI runs, and connect the 2 via localhost? reply duped 3 hours agorootparentIf you do this please don't use localhost, the socket domain for IPC is AF_UNIX not AF_INET. Even Windows supports it. reply nu11ptr 2 hours agorootparentThen I would need two different mechanisms. Local and remote are both satisfied by TCP sockets, so this is easier. reply nu11ptr 4 hours agorootparentprevAs one option, yes, the other option is to run them on different machines. App isn't done yet but the idea is that you are presented an option to either connect locally (if localhost detected) or remotely via auth on UI startup. reply mdhb 5 hours agorootparentprevNot op but I’m developing an application with this exact approach as we speak, although my backend code is in Dart also. You can also do gRPC over Unix domain sockets too if you’re sticking with desktop but overall I really like this approach as it makes it trivial for me to move from desktop app to web app with only some minor config changes. reply sbt567 14 hours agoprevWell done! I've heard only good things about rust_flutter_bridge. Some questions though (more like flutter question), how bloated flutter is (i.e. final app size) compared to mobile native (Java, Swift?) for simple app? And how's the UI performance looks like? reply fzyzcjy 12 hours agoparentFor app size, it depends on your specific scenario, because e.g. Flutter automatically removes library code that is not used. I remembered (but the memory is blur) simple app has something like ~5MB. Btw remember to split .so file per abi. For UI performance, I personally find it quite good, and Flutter(Dart) is compiled to assembly code via AOT (instead of e.g. JIT or interpreted), which theoretically speaking is also fast. For both, I would suggest to make a demo for your specific case to have more accurate results. Also I guess ask/discuss on the Flutter community may help. reply burakemir 14 hours agoprevInteresting! IIUC this is done using source-to-source translation? It is a bit hard to understand from the docs what technical approach is. The docs are clearly aimed at users and I find them impressive, well done. I'd be interested in knowing the approach and how it compares to wasm based Rust web frameworks before diving more deeply into it. One advantage of combining Rust with Flutter seems to be that Flutter is a whole framework already and one would be able to share code and data structures between server and client side. A comparison with other ways Rust reply fzyzcjy 12 hours agoparentThanks!

Sadly, it's not a first class citizen in Tauri 2.0 as promised. I tried both Flutter and Tauri.

In my opinion, obviously. reply mdhb 9 hours agorootparentprevIf you’re doing some super intensive data processing or have specialist use cases then yeah, sure feel free to write that part in Rust, C or whatever you like. That’s literally what this package is about. Unlocking that use case for you although Dart also has bindings for Go, Java, Kotlin, C, and Swift so you can take your pick. But the reality is that Dart compiles down to native code on all platforms and is not going to be slower in any way that actually matters or is noticeable to users in the vast vast vast majority of scenarios and the productivity hit you take from moving to Rust or C from Dart is also an order of magnitude slower. reply webprofusion 9 hours agoprevCool, but the point of having stuff in Rust is to ideally have everything in Rust, or you're by definition not getting all the safety benefits of Rust. reply jenadine 9 hours agoparentDart is also safe. reply ramon156 4 hours agoparentprevWhile dart is definitely not like rust, dart is a very safe language.

The only safety rust brings to the table is memory safety, which most languages achieve with a runtime and a garbage collector, which have a performance tradeoff. reply wongarsu 6 hours agorootparentIn three most narrow definition of safety I agree. But that's a very narrow definition. Rust does offer a lot more: - no undefined behavior - many classes of concurrency bugs prevented by the type system - standard library and much of the ecosystem makes invalid states unrepresentable. E.g. a String is always valid UTF8 Those are things that are true to varying degrees for other languages. Dart does pretty well imho. But for example Java and C# offer memory safety but have very unsafe concurrency reply pjmlp 5 hours agorootparentRust's concurrency is only safe in the very specific use case of threads trying to access common resources on the same memory space. It does nothing to prevent data races between processes, or concurrency errors between threads accessing resources that are external to the process. Scenarios quite relevant in distributed systems. reply CryZe 6 hours agorootparentprevYou definitely also get a lot more thread safety out of Rust than most languages. reply jurschreuder 12 hours agoprev [–] Isn't Flutter basically a way to use the C++ render engine from Chrome, with a \"scripting\" language most similar to Kotlin and Swift?

This is what projects like Tauri (in Rust) and Wails (in Go) are doing[0][1]. Utilizing Webview to develop applications, but they still don't support mobile, Tauri mobile is in beta. Basically Tauri and Wails are on one side (HTML/CSS) trying to approach cross platform by supporting mobile platforms, while Flutter and Kotlin Compose Multiplatform started from the other side. So it depends on your needs, web-first or mobile-first, and what platforms matter to you.

    "originBody": "Home Ribbonfarm Studio Substack For New Readers Now Reading About Books ribbonfarm constructions in magical thinking The Gervais Principle, Or The Office According to “The Office” October 7, 2009 By Venkatesh Rao My neighbor introduced me to The Office back in 2005. Since then, I’ve watched every episode of both the British and American versions. I’ve watched the show obsessively because I’ve been unable to figure out what makes it so devastatingly effective, and elevates it so far above the likes of Dilbert and Office Space. Series HomePart IPart IIPart IIIPart IVPart VPart VIebook Until now, that is. Now, after four years, I’ve finally figured the show out. The Office is not a random series of cynical gags aimed at momentarily alleviating the existential despair of low-level grunts. It is a fully realized theory of management that falsifies 83.8% of the business section of the bookstore. The theory begins with Hugh MacLeod’s well-known cartoon, Company Hierarchy (below), and its cornerstone is something I will call The Gervais Principle, which supersedes both the Peter Principle and its successor, The Dilbert Principle. Outside of the comic aisle, the only major and significant works consistent with the Gervais Principle are The Organization Man and Images of Organization. I’ll need to lay just a little bit of groundwork (lest you think this whole post is a riff based on cartoons) before I can get to the principle and my interpretation of The Office. I’ll be basing this entire article on the American version of the show, which is more fully developed than the original British version, though the original is perhaps more satisfyingly bleak. Keep in mind that this is an interpretation of The Office as management science; the truth in the art. Literary/artistic critics don’t really seem to get it. I’ll have some passing comments to offer on the comedy and art of it all, but this is primarily about the truths revealed by the show, pursued with Dwight-like earnestness. From The Whyte School to The Gervais Principle Hugh MacLeod’s cartoon is a pitch-perfect symbol of an unorthodox school of management based on the axiom that organizations don’t suffer pathologies; they are intrinsically pathological constructs. Idealized organizations are not perfect. They are perfectly pathological. So while most most management literature is about striving relentlessly towards an ideal by executing organization theories completely, this school, which I’ll call the Whyte school, would recommend that you do the bare minimum organizing to prevent chaos, and then stop. Let a natural, if declawed, individualist Darwinism operate beyond that point. The result is the MacLeod hierarchy. It may be horrible, but like democracy, it is the best you can do. The Sociopath (capitalized) layer comprises the Darwinian/Protestant Ethic will-to-power types who drive an organization to function despite itself. The Clueless layer is what Whyte called the “Organization Man,” but the archetype inhabiting the middle has evolved a good deal since Whyte wrote his book (in the fifties). The Losers are not social losers (as in the opposite of “cool”), but people who have struck bad bargains economically – giving up capitalist striving for steady paychecks. I am not making this connection up. Consider this passage from OM: Of all organization men, the true executive is the one who remains most suspicious of The Organization. If there is one thing that characterizes him, it is a fierce desire to control his own destiny and, deep down, he resents yielding that control to The Organization, no matter how velvety its grip… he wants to dominate, not be dominated…Many people from the great reaches of middle management can become true believers in The Organization…But the most able are not vouchsafed this solace. Back then, Whyte was extremely pessimistic. He saw signs that in the struggle for dominance between the Sociopaths (whom he admired as the ones actually making the organization effective despite itself) and the middle-management Organization Man, the latter was winning. He was wrong, but not in the way you’d think. The Sociopaths defeated the Organization Men and turned them into The Clueless not by reforming the organization, but by creating a meta-culture of Darwinism in the economy: one based on job-hopping, mergers, acquisitions, layoffs, cataclysmic reorganizations, outsourcing, unforgiving start-up ecosystems, and brutal corporate raiding. In this terrifying meta-world of the Titans, the Organization Man became the Clueless Man. Today, any time an organization grows too brittle, bureaucratic and disconnected from reality, it is simply killed, torn apart and cannibalized, rather than reformed. The result is the modern creative-destructive life cycle of the firm, which I’ll call the MacLeod Life Cycle. A Sociopath with an idea recruits just enough Losers to kick off the cycle. As it grows it requires a Clueless layer to turn it into a controlled reaction rather than a runaway explosion. Eventually, as value hits diminishing returns, both the Sociopaths and Losers make their exits, and the Clueless start to dominate. Finally, the hollow brittle shell collapses on itself and anything of value is recycled by the sociopaths according to meta-firm logic. MacLeod’s Loser layer had me puzzled for a long time, because I was interpreting it in cultural terms: the kind of person you call a “loser.” While some may be losers in that sense too, they are primarily losers in the economic sense: those who have, for various reasons, made (or been forced to make) a bad economic bargain. They’ve given up some potential for long-term economic liberty (as capitalists) for short-term economic stability. Traded freedom for a paycheck in short. They actually produce, but are not compensated in proportion to the value they create (since their compensation is set by Sociopaths operating under conditions of serious moral hazard). They mortgage their lives away, and hope to die before their money runs out. The good news is that Losers have two ways out, which we’ll get to later: turning Sociopath or turning into bare-minimum performers. The Losers destined for cluelessness do not have a choice. Based on the MacLeod lifecycle, we can also separate the three layers based on the timing of their entry and exit into organizations. The Sociopaths enter and exit organizations at will, at any stage, and do whatever it takes to come out on top. The contribute creativity in early stages of a organization’s life, neurotic leadership in the middle stages, and cold-bloodedness in the later stages, where they drive decisions like mergers, acquisitions and layoffs that others are too scared or too compassionate to drive. They are also the ones capable of equally impersonally exploiting a young idea for growth in the beginning, killing one good idea to concentrate resources on another at maturity, and milking an end-of-life idea through harvest-and-exit market strategies. The Losers like to feel good about their lives. They are the happiness seekers, rather than will-to-power players, and enter and exit reactively, in response to the meta-Darwinian trends in the economy. But they have no more loyalty to the firm than the Sociopaths. They do have a loyalty to individual people, and a commitment to finding fulfillment through work when they can, and coasting when they cannot. The Clueless are the ones who lack the competence to circulate freely through the economy (unlike Sociopaths and Losers), and build up a perverse sense of loyalty to the firm, even when events make it abundantly clear that the firm is not loyal to them. To sustain themselves, they must be capable of fashioning elaborate delusions based on idealized notions of the firm — the perfectly pathological entities we mentioned. Unless squeezed out by forces they cannot resist, they hang on as long as possible, long after both Sociopaths and Losers have left (in Douglas Adams’ vicious history of our planet, humanity was founded by a spaceship full of the Clueless, sent here by scheming Sociopaths). When cast adrift in the open ocean, they are the ones most likely to be utterly destroyed. Which brings us to our main idea. How both the pyramid and its lifecycle are animated. The dynamics are governed by the Newton’s Law of organizations: the Gervais Principle. The Gervais Principle and Its Consequences The Gervais Principle is this: Sociopaths, in their own best interests, knowingly promote over-performing losers into middle-management, groom under-performing losers into sociopaths, and leave the average bare-minimum-effort losers to fend for themselves. The Gervais principle differs from the Peter Principle, which it superficially resembles. The Peter Principle states that all people are promoted to the level of their incompetence. It is based on the assumption that future promotions are based on past performance. The Peter Principle is wrong for the simple reason that executives aren’t that stupid, and because there isn’t that much room in an upward-narrowing pyramid. They know what it takes for a promotion candidate to perform at the to level. So if they are promoting people beyond their competence anyway, under conditions of opportunity scarcity, there must be a good reason. Scott Adams, seeing a different flaw in the Peter Principle, proposed the Dilbert Principle: that companies tend to systematically promote their least-competent employees to middle management to limit the damage they can do. This again is untrue. The Gervais principle predicts the exact opposite: that the most competent ones will be promoted to middle management. Michael Scott was a star salesman before he become a Clueless middle manager. The least competent employees (but not all of them — only certain enlightened incompetents) will be promoted not to middle management, but fast-tracked through to senior management. To the Sociopath level. And in case you are wondering, the unenlightened under-performers get fired. Let me illustrate the logic and implications of the principle with examples from the show. The Career of the Clueless In Season Three, the Dunder-Mifflin executives decide to merge the Stamford and Scranton branches, laying off much of the latter, including Michael Scott. His counterpart, the Sociopath Stamford branch manager, whose promotion is the premise of the re-org, opportunistically leverages his impending promotion into an executive position at a competitor, leaving the c0mpany in disarray. The Dunder-Mifflin executives, forced to deal with the fallout, cynically play out the now-illogical re-org anyway, shutting down Stamford and leaving Michael with the merged branch instead. The executives (David Wallace and Jan Levinson-Gould) are completely aware of Michael’s utter incompetence. Their calculations are obvious: giving Michael the expanded branch allows them to claim short-term success and buy time to maneuver out of having to personally suffer longer-term consequences. Jim’s remark on the drama is revealing. Comparing Michael to his exiting sociopath peer he says: “Whatever you say about Michael, he would never have done something like this,” a testament to Michael’s determinedly deluded loyalty to the company that will never be loyal to him. We can safely assume that Michael’s previous promotion to regional manager occurred under similar circumstances of callous short-term calculations by sociopaths. So why is promoting over-performing Losers logical? The simple reason is that if you over-perform at the Loser level, it is clear that you are an idiot. You’ve already made a bad bargain, and now you’re delivering more value than you need to, making your bargain even worse. Unless you very quickly demonstrate that you know your own value by successfully negotiating more money and/or power, you are marked out as an exploitable clueless Loser. At one point, Darryl, angling for a raise, learns to his astonishment that the raise he is asking for would make his salary higher than Michael’s. Michael hasn’t negotiated a better deal in 14 years. Darryl — a minimum-effort Loser with strains of Sociopath — doesn’t miss a step. He convinces and coaches Michael into asking for his own raise, so he can get his. A Loser who can be suckered into bad bargains is set to become one of the Clueless. That’s why they are promoted: they are worth even more as Clueless pawns in the middle than as direct producers at the bottom, where the average, rationally-disengaged Loser will do. At the bottom, the overperformers can merely add a predictable amount of value. In the middle they can be used by the Sociopaths to escape the consequences of high-risk machinations like re-orgs. The Career of the Sociopath The example of the “fast-track the under-performing” part of the principle is Ryan, the intern. He tests himself quickly and rapidly learns and accepts that he is incompetent as a salesman. But he is a born pragmatist with the drive, ambition, daring and lack of principles to make it to the top. So rather than waste time trying to get good at sales, he slips into a wait-watch-grab opportunist mode. But he isn’t checked out; he is engaged, but in an experimental way, probing for his opening. The difference between him and the average checked-out Loser is illustrated in one brilliant scene early in his career. He suggests, during a group stacking effort in the warehouse, that they form a bucket brigade to work more efficiently. The minimum-effort Loser Stanley tells him coldly, “this here is a run-out-the-clock situation.” The line could apply to Stanley’s entire life. Stanley’s response shows both his intelligence and clear-eyed self-awareness of his Loser bargain with the company. He therefore acts according to a mix of self-preservation and minimum-effort coasting instincts. The same is true of everybody else in the Loser layer with the exception of the over-performers: Dwight and Andy (and in his earlier incarnation as a salesperson, Michael). The future Sociopath must be an under-performer at the bottom. Like the average Loser, he recognizes that the bargain is a really bad one. Unlike the risk-averse loser though, he does not try to make the best of a bad situation by doing enough to get by. He has no intention of just getting by. He very quickly figures out — through experiments and fast failures — that the Loser game is not worth becoming good at. He then severely under-performs in order to free up energy to concentrate on maneuvering an upward exit. He knows his under-performance is not sustainable, but he has no intention of becoming a lifetime-Loser employee anyway. He takes the calculated risk that he’ll find a way up before he is fired for incompetence. Ryan’s character displays this path brilliantly. When Michael’s boss and dominatrix-lover Jan suffers a psychotic meltdown, her boss, the uber-sociopath David Wallace, has no great hopes of a good outcome. Setting up yet another band-aid move, he calls up Michael for an interview to take up Jan’s spot. But when the rest of the office learns of Michael’s impending interview (during Michael’s farcical attempts at using a Survivor style contest to choose his successor, which predictably, only Dwight takes seriously), the true Sociopaths act. Jim and his Sociopath girlfriend Karen instantly call up David and announce their candidacies for the same position. Unknown to them, Ryan, the intern-turned-rookie, has also spotted the opportunity. The outcome is spectacular: Ryan gets the job, Michael loses, Karen is promoted to manager of the Utica branch, and Jim — who still has not yet completely embraced his inner Sociopath — returns to Scranton. We learn later — as the Gervais principle would predict — that David Wallace never seriously considered Michael more than a temporary last resort. Much later, in a deposition during Jan’s lawsuit against the company, he reveals that Michael was never a serious candidate. The Career of the Loser The career of the Loser is the easiest to understand. Having made a bad bargain, and not marked for either Clueless or Sociopath trajectories, he or she must make the best of a bad situation. The most rational thing to do is slack off and do the minimum necessary. Doing more would be a Clueless thing to do. Doing less would take the high-energy machinations of the Sociopath, since it sets up self-imposed up-or-out time pressure. So the Loser — really not a loser at all if you think about it — pays his dues, does not ask for much, and finds meaning in his life elsewhere. For Stanley it is crossword puzzles. For Angela it is a colorless Martha-Stewartish religious life. For Kevin, it is his rock band. For Kelly, it is mindless airhead pop-culture distractions. Pam has her painting ambitions. Meredith is an alcoholic slut. Oscar, the ironic-token gay character, has his intellectual posturing. Creed, a walking freak-show, marches to the beat of his own obscure different drum (he is the most rationally checked-out of all the losers). If you leave out the clear marked-for-Clueless characters, Dwight and Andy, you are left with the two most interesting characters in the show: the will-he-won’t-he Sociopath-in-the-making, Jim, and the strange Toby. Toby is a curious case — intellectually a Sociopath, but without the energy or ambition to be an active sociopath. More about these two later. The Emergence of the MacLeod Hierarchy Dastardly as all this sounds, it is actually pretty efficient, given the inevitability of the MacLeod hierarchy and life cycle. The Sociopaths know that the only way to make an organization capable of survival is to buffer the intense chemistry between the producer-Losers and the leader-Sociopaths with enough Clueless padding in the middle to mitigate the risks of business. Without it, the company would explode like a nuclear bomb, rather than generate power steadily like a reactor. On the other hand, the business wouldn’t survive very long without enough people actually thinking in cold, calculating ways. The average-performing , mostly-disengaged Losers can create diminishing-margins profitability, but not sustainable performance or growth. You need a steady supply of Sociopaths for that, and you cannot waste time moving them slowly up the ranks, especially since the standard promotion/development path is primarily designed to maneuver the Clueless into position wherever they are needed. The Sociopaths must be freed up as much as possible to actually run the business, with or without official titles. So Ryan floats directly to the top, where he does what is expected of him — lead a bold strategic gamble by building an online sales channel operation. As with any big strategic move, the operation has its risks, and fails. And here we find that Ryan is still not quite experienced enough as a sociopath. He foolishly goes the Enron route, attempting to cook the books to avoid failure, and is found out and arrested. A true master Sociopath like David Wallace would instead have spotted the impending failure, promoted a Michael to take over (who would obviously be so gratified at being given a new white-elephant title that he would not have seen disaster looming), and have him take the blame for the inevitable failure. Completely legal and efficient. The Organization as Psychic Prison Which brings us to the other major management book that is consistent with the Gervais Principle, Images of Organization, Gareth Morgan’s magisterial study of the metaphors through which we understand organizations. Of the eight systemic metaphors in the book, the one that is most relevant here is the metaphor of an organization as a psychic prison. The image is derived from Plato’s allegory of the cave, which I won’t get into here. Suffice it to say that it divides people into those who get how the world really works (the Sociopaths and the self-aware slacker Losers) and those who don’t (the over-performer Losers and the Clueless in the middle). This is where Gervais has broken new ground, primarily because as an artist, he is interested in the subjective experience of being Clueless (most sitcoms are about Losers). For your everyday Sociopath, it is sufficient to label someone clueless and manipulate them. What Gervais managed to create is a very compelling portrait of the Clueless, a work of art with real business value. Here is the ultimate explanation of Michael Scott’s (and David Brent’s) careers: they are put into a position of having to explain their own apparent, unexpected and unexamined success. It is easy to explain failure. Random success is harder. Remember, they are promoted primarily as passive pawns to either allow the Sociopaths to escape the risks of their actions, or to make way for the Sociopaths to move up faster. They are presented with an interesting bit of cognitive dissonance: being nominally given greater power, but in reality being safely shunted away from the pathways of power. They must choose to either construct false narratives or decline apparent opportunities. The Clueless resolve this dissonance by choosing to believe in the reality of the organization. Not everybody is capable of this level of suspension of disbelief. Both Ricky Gervais (David Brent) and Steve Carrel (Michael Scott) play the brilliantly drawn characters perfectly. The most visible sign of their capacity for self-delusion is their complete inability to generate an original thought. They quote movie lines, lyrics and perform terrible impersonations (at one point Michael goes, “You talking to me?” a line he attributes, in a masterful display of confusion, to “Al Pacino, Raging Bull“). For much of what he needs to say, he gropes for empty business phrases, deploying them with staggering incompetence. When Michael talks, he is attempting, like a child, to copy the flawless Powertalk spoken by sociopaths like Jan and David Wallace. He is oblivious to the fact that the Sociopaths use Powertalk as a coded language with which to simultaneously sustain the (necessary) delusions of the Clueless and communicate with each other. It is not just the Sociopaths who conspire to sustain Michael’s delusions. So do the checked-out Losers, sometimes out of kindness, and sometimes out of self-interest. In one particularly perfect summing up, Oscar describes the impending “Dundies” award ceremony (a veritable monument to the consensual enablement of Michael’s delusions) as “The Dundies are kind of like a kid’s birthday party. And you go, and there’s really nothing for you to do there, but the kid’s having a really good time, so you… You’re kind of there. That’s… That’s kind of what it’s like.” But Michael isn’t entirely a puppet. Buried under layers of denial is a clear understanding of his own, hopeless, powerless life, which makes him marginally more clued-in than say, Dwight. His response is frenetic and desperate manipulation of the drama of false validation that has been set up for his benefit. Some of this is with the knowing consent of his enablers. Like experienced improv-comics, within limits, the rest of the office follows the rule of agreement in the Theater of Michael (in a brilliant piece of meta-commentary, in one episode we get to see Michael at his own impossibly bad worst in his real improv class, where he ruins every single sketch). But Michael’s grand narrative requires constant, exhausting work to keep up. He must amplify and rope in even the most minor piece of validation into the service of his script. When, in a moment of weakness, Jim shares a genuine confidence with him, Michael is so thrilled that he turns the moment into a deep imaginary friendship, practically becoming a stalker, even mimicking Jim’s hairstyle. At the other end, he over-represses even the slightest potential dent to his self-image. His is a thin-skinnedness gone crazy. Reality is sealed away with psychotic urgency, but to do so, he must first scout it out with equal urgency. And so, when Jim (in the first true Sociopath move of his career) engineers a private meeting with the visiting David Wallace to carve out a promotion, Michael tries to crash the meeting. When politely turned away, he instantly switches scripts and pretends he is too busy and that he is the one who can’t attend. And then he sneaks into the meeting room anyway, first with various excuses, and finally by hiding in a Trojan-Horse cheese cart. This sort of ability to work hard to sustain the theater of his own delusions, half-aware that he is doing so, is what makes Michael a genuine candidate for promotion to the ranks of the Clueless. Dwight is interesting precisely because he lacks Michael’s capacity for this pathological meta-cognition, and the ability to offer semi-believable scripts that others can at least help bolster. Dwight is not talented enough at Cluelessness to ever be promoted. Is There More? You bet. We haven’t even scratched the surface. Dwight, Jim, and Toby each deserve an entire essay. Michael and Ryan probably deserve one each as well, in addition to my quick sketches here. And there are other principles, lemmas and sundry theoretical constructs. But I’ll hold off. Maybe there aren’t as many Office watchers among this blog’s readers as I imagine. You guys tell me if you want more. I’ll conclude with one thought: Gervais deserves Nobel prizes in both literature and economics.

Follow him on Twitter Comments otoburb says October 7, 2009 at 10:48 pm Need more. This is really deep (seriously). Love it. Thanks! Part of my problem has been that I was flagged for the sociopath track (in general terms), but slowly have come to the realization that this seems more and more like the clueless track instead. If you don’t feel comfortable making the cold, ruthless decisions, I’m just kidding myself that I could be an effective sociopath; which only really leaves the C or L layers :) mansoor says October 7, 2009 at 11:18 pm absolutely BRILLIANT! more more and then some more please! Venkat says October 8, 2009 at 8:44 am Thanks Mansoor! @otoburb Figuring out which of the 3 tracks you are on, a priori, is non-trivial I think. No real person reaches asymptotic perfection in any of the 3 directions, so there is always some doubt… worth exploring in a future post if I have better things to say. Dan says October 8, 2009 at 9:22 am I feel the same– like we just got started here. I want to keep reading. This is one of my all time favorite ribbonfarm pieces. Diane F says October 8, 2009 at 10:32 am I’ve never seen “the Office” but I understand everything you have said about the organization. Over time, we seem to bob back and forth between mostly 2 layers; every time ambition and the illusion of entrepreneurship deludes us into trying until a harsh reminder of just how clueless we are hurls us back into the loser strata. There, comfort , relative success and the interests of sociopaths, tug us again along the upward track. The glass ceiling is for those of us without the dominant sociopath gene. Thank you for explaining that intense sense of futility so many of us experience. ” If you were going to be somebody, you would have been somebody by now”- Robert Deniro, Taxi Driver Venkat says October 8, 2009 at 7:08 pm The inter-level oscillation is interesting. Perhaps those who get into that mode are turning work into a Sisyphean project. Or maybe the sociopaths are merely the lucky Sisyphus types whose rocks miraculously stayed on top of the hill :) Dominant sociopath gene is one necessary condition probably. Another is possible sheer willingness to work very hard once you are on the path. It is the latter that I sometimes doubt I have. Anyway, keep the comments coming… am going off for a short vacation, so will be mostly off the grid, but I’ll be catching up with the conversation and responding once I get back in a few days. Venkat RG says October 9, 2009 at 1:17 am Brutal and brilliant statement: “They… hope to die before their money runs out.” Using terms from your previous post, they hope to shrink time as they are unable to expand money. Intrapreneurship offers sociopath roles for some of the (lucky?) clueless. I think there is a strangely different phenomenon operating in large, stable and long-lived bureacracies: a set of sociopathic clueless controlling the clueless sociopaths, who have succeeded in building too large a clueless layer that has collectively seized control in a non-obvious manner, using labyrinths of obscure processes. SG says November 14, 2009 at 2:29 pm RG, you are closer to the mark than might be apparent at first glance. I think that what you have described is probably the empirical incarnation of the 3rd stage of the life cycle described above. I for one can say from experience in a wallowing organization that this is exactly how it plays out before someone comes along and realizes “hey, we can acquire this firm’s core value, fire 85% of the (clueless) employees, and come out on top” which constitutes phase 4… denny says October 9, 2009 at 2:43 am Absolutely brilliant job of opening up the subject of pathological organization for discussion! I have only watched a few episodes of the shows, but I live in the real world and have lots and lots of corroborating evidence that you are on the right track from that. Xianhang Zhang says October 9, 2009 at 9:41 pm I wonder what you think about this Netflix internal memo: http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664?src=embed . Is this a cynical ploy from sociopaths dressed up in shiny new clothing? A potentially new way of doing business? An exception that proves the rule? Intrinsically flawed and doomed to failure in the long run? Or something else entirely? Venkat says October 15, 2009 at 4:32 am My general thought is that any information that can be codified and systematized like the Netflix PPT cannot be part of the information advantage of the sociopath layer. By definition, they figure out where the rules end and learn to operate in the undefined regions beyond. Bharadwaj says October 9, 2009 at 10:33 pm Delicious.! My first thought : I need to get in touch with my inner sociopath. This should go into the book you are writing. Loved it. Manju says October 12, 2009 at 2:56 am Venkat, This was gripping! I don’t think I still understand the nuances of S, C & L…but at some level it does make sense and you can identify shades of those theories to be prevalent everywhere! I have no idea where I belong, it could be C or L and definitely not S!! Cold-blooded, ruthless etc are such strong ‘expletives’ that it shudders me!! An aside; here’s a small one from poet Mukesh Anand, who recently published his book. I forget the entire poem, but this is the mukhda! NaaDe se aTke hai.N pajame jaise log bas baatei.N pakaate rehte hai.N pajame jaise log Joe says October 13, 2009 at 4:11 pm Great article, but the first few paragraphs were so stilted with “clueless” banter that I almost stopped reading. Your writing really took off when you got to the meat of the article, and stopped introducing the article. “The Office is not a random series of cynical gags aimed at momentarily alleviating the existential despair of low-level grunts. It is a fully-realized theory of management that falsifies 83.8% of the business section of the bookstore. ” “The Office is not simple gags attempting to alleviate the despair of low-level grunts. It’s a complete management theory falsifying 83.8% of business books.” Here’s another example: “I may be misremembering the exact line.” — I don’t think misremembering is a word, or at best it is an awkward mouthful. The word exact is redundant. “I may be misquoting the line.” — If you’re quoting we know it is meant to be exact, and if you’re incorrect ‘misquote’ is the appropriate word. — End Grammar Nazi — Great article. If I didn’t like it I wouldn’t leave a comment at all. Wing Commander says October 14, 2009 at 6:31 am I say this last sentence lands you squarely at the top of the Sociopath pyramid, on the Clueless, Loser & Sociopath scale. Gerald Fnord says October 13, 2009 at 7:29 pm So, how do we do better? This question is _not_ a right-wing snark, it is an honest question. The only thing I can come up with is: people tolerate being led by sociopaths, or by sociopaths and thee clueless, because they fell they can’t do better, or are very afraid of doing worse. Idolising Continental Europe is, in its own way, as idiotic as Marketolatry, but even so I can’t shake the conviction that we in the States and in Britain, faced with an inadequate dole, are much more afraid of poverty, and so will put up with a lot more than is good for us. Derek M says October 13, 2009 at 11:24 pm He’s not making an argument for a right, wrong, better or worse. It is a commentary on the organizational makeup in our capitalistic society. And may I add a bloody brilliant one. I as a “loser” stuck there because of economic conditions can wholeheartedly relate. I can easily pick out which co-workers full into which categorize, which is sadly dominated by as many clueless and losers as predicted. Please more. BillS says October 14, 2009 at 1:43 pm “So, how do we do better?” Thinking a more fair and loving socio-economic structure is possible and worth working hard to imagine and thus to create lands you smack in the clueless zone. Yeswecanitalitarianism is it? this is widely considered the most efficient capital distribution structure in history, i remind you. btw, this is a cartoon-based universe he’s created, but quite amusing for this old lefty to read. short answer, tune-in, turn-on and drop-out! denny says October 15, 2009 at 2:24 am “Yeswecanitalitarianism” lol – yes we can do better, but first, you have to wake up to how bad we are doing. Fink says October 13, 2009 at 11:22 pm Brilliant… Hope there’s more coming Management says October 14, 2009 at 12:02 am A slice of jesus toast. James says October 14, 2009 at 12:08 am Great article but seriously the American version is garbage. Bonobo says October 14, 2009 at 12:36 am Ahhh, rehashing my entire life before my eyes in one article from good to bad and back again. All the work, companies, dim bulbs and sociopaths roll back through memory. We choose a train with a positive path, jumping off before derailment to avoid being a loser in a trailer park at age 70. Making decisions on a moving train always involves careful calculations, though, since you don’t want to land on your head or in a deep chasm, and god forbid you have to jump off at night. The trick: Holding onto the cash when you bail. The Sociopath “squirrels” his cash away before or upon triggering his exit strategy. The Clueless believe in the latest Oprah Business Book and “my next raise”. The Corporate Loser slogs along with an independent view which may be the most free person of the group if he works steadily to gain financial independence outside the corporation. Are you owned … or not? Champeen says October 14, 2009 at 12:41 am Give us more – – this is thoughtful, reasoned commentary. tinner says October 14, 2009 at 1:58 am Absolutely brilliant. Love The Office although apart from deep investigation of each character – you might as well just enjoy it on a shallow level of similarities between the show and real life. I do prefer your way Venkat – this is astonishing interpretation – thanks. nabot says October 14, 2009 at 2:11 am I’ve been watching the show from the start and been a bare-minimum loser for a couple years now. This essay was truelly insightfull. You’ve just put words on a lot of “feelings”. Thanks a lot. Need more. Kevin Smith says October 14, 2009 at 2:31 am This describes the situation of physicians in the Ontario health “care” system over the past twenty years [and the evolution of the medical profession in Ontario] very accurately. Quite amazing! This is a good academic piece, and needs to be expanded upon. Thanks to Yves Smith at nakedcapitalism for pointing us to this. sardaukar says October 14, 2009 at 2:49 am Great article, keep them coming. ryan says October 14, 2009 at 2:53 am I believe it was Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull, not Al Pacino. None says October 14, 2009 at 12:11 pm Rao knows that, it is Michael who got it wrong on the show. It is a direct quote from the character on the show. Read it again: (at one point Michael goes, “You talking to me?” a line he attributes, in a masterful display of confusion, to “Al Pacino, Raging Bull“). -jhl- says October 14, 2009 at 12:23 pm it was DeNiro in “taxi driver” http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075314/quotes#qt0252592 None says October 14, 2009 at 12:59 pm …and Michael (the character) incorrectly said “You talking to me?” “Al Pacino, Raging Bull” showing off his ignorance (wrong movie, wrong actor in wrong movie). Derik Pereira says October 14, 2009 at 3:52 am This is an amazing writeup. I would buy you a whole pot of coffee, even though I usually make my own using a generic store brand. In fact, after reviewing your other write ups, I may give you a case of coffee. All the same, it seems that here (in the US) we generally have coffee machines that take ground coffee beans. When I was in West Africa working on a project this spring I found it somewhat impossible to find ground coffee. In fact, I had to search high and low to buy a coffee machine. Either way, I took a pound of ground coffee with me and was able to watch the African sun rise every morning while drinking a pot of coffee every day. More recently (years in my case), I have lost any and all interest in watching TV. For reasons I do not seem to know. In fact, I feel somewhat “sick” when I am exposed to TV (visual and sound). Obviously, I do not live in a cave and have been secularly “blessed” with a spouse unit and kids who watch TV. So, sometimes I do hear some interesting things that I make some subjective (in my mind) judgements and the level of intellectual content of such TV. Maybe, there is much to learn on a “watch” TV once more before I leave the planet. Finally, I believe you think on some levels that I think. The difference is that you seem to organize and write on levels that I have not been able to reach. It does appear that if I had reached your level (of writing), I may indeed have had some interesting things for other people to read (or hear since I seem to hear when I read). All the same, I do have some interesting things that I have in my mind (that strangely is the only (maybe) place that no earthly thing will never (maybe) be able to infiltrate). There is a book that Marvin Minsky wrote a few years ago called “Society of the Mind”. Now, that is a cool book. My first Marvin book was in college in the 70s and dealt with Artificial Intelligence. I am not sure whether you have run into him or his books and public thoughts. Finally, finally it seems that you have bridged your working in the “rocket science” and non-working (your writing) in the “people-science” domains. It seems that for me it took 50 years to get there. I look forward to an interesting journey with your future work! Thanks for sharing your some of your mind … Venkat says October 15, 2009 at 4:36 am Yup, I’ve read ‘society of mind’ (or most of it anyway). African sunrise with coffee. Sounds strangely appealing. Sunrise I mean. citizen doe says October 14, 2009 at 4:00 am Please, sir, I’d like some more. OwenFinn says October 14, 2009 at 4:31 am Thank you for this — truly brilliant. Dave H says October 14, 2009 at 4:32 am Brilliant. I’ll never forget the night I stumbled upon the office. It was an early show and I wasn’t sure at first if it was parody or earnest. Horribly I’m inclined to see the system you accurately model as a fairly good one. Unions and socialism seem to be just a power shift toward the losers, with seniority the ultimate expression of losers in charge. I’m one of the fortunate few who’ve successfully made an independant niche outside that system, as a sole proprietor support business owner. Mark says October 14, 2009 at 5:49 am Perhaps unions and socialism ultimately follow the same structure — what greater sociopathic gamble is there than to overturn the whole of society in order to come out on top? And, from a sociopathic point of view, how better to deal with the threat of rivals than to create a society based on the idea that Darwinist capitalism has been vanquished (though true sociopaths, I suppose, would never really believe this, their ascent might be delayed). Potential threats can then be portrayed not as challengers to the leaders, but as traitors to the people, which is perhaps more difficult in companies. Scott says October 14, 2009 at 4:57 am Wonderful article! I really hope you go more in depth into this. Definately will be subscribing! Chev says October 14, 2009 at 5:43 am Excellent analysis. For those of us in the corporate world, also allows us to turn the focus inward – where do we sit on this pyramid? -CC BigBadBank says October 14, 2009 at 6:02 am Great stuff. Bill G says October 14, 2009 at 6:13 am I realize that “data” is not the plural of “anecdote” but I am moved to comment here because this brilliant article entirely explains my career trajectory. As a younger man I was an over-performing, well-liked loser who was promoted into the ranks of the clueless. Eventually I realized I had made a colossally bad bargain and left my organization to become a contented minimum-effort loser in an organization small enough that sociopathy is pointless–there are no promotions to be had. My nascent ambition held in check by a ceiling that’s pressing down on my head, my economic concerns relieved by achieving a 30% raise when I switched jobs, I find meaning and satisfaction in life through my family, friends and hobbies. It is perhaps interesting that my escape from cluelessness coincides closely with the birth of my children. Maybe there’s hope for me yet. IMO this economic hypothesis deserves a book-length treatment. But for everyone’s sake get it marketed as humor and not as a “business” book; as Jon Stewart knows, that’s how you rise above the noise and get taken seriously. Venkat says October 15, 2009 at 4:39 am There is something in the thought about children that seems to require probing… can’t quite put my finger on it though. rycamor says November 14, 2009 at 10:02 am Having children forces you to grow up, for one thing. Sometimes that forces you to make a more cold-blooded bargain with your career in favor of your family. In other words, stop chasing rainbows and realize that life is more than career. Vidar Andersen says October 14, 2009 at 6:27 am I love it! Please give us more. I’ll buy you a coffee! :) Mike says October 14, 2009 at 6:35 am Great post! I’ll drop a few coins in the tip jar when I get home from work. Lil'D says October 14, 2009 at 6:37 am Wow. I’m going to reread this but it gave me a feeling like being able to see after years of wandering around in the dark. Josh says October 14, 2009 at 6:39 am Very well written. Please do expand further as you have time, it’s proven to be a very enlightening read. Wing Commander says October 14, 2009 at 6:41 am I’ll chime in with the majority and agree this analysis very precisely describes the organizations in which I’ve worked over the years. Some were retail, some were media some were higher ed. All of them have similarities. What I find most brilliant is that you identified the over-achieving loser. They aren’t sociopaths the way I would have thought because they get to a certain level and just stay there for a long period of time, and are absolutely necessary for the day to day operations of a department. I’ve occasionally volunteered to be temporarily assigned to positions like that and regretted it after the fact. No, I will not be an over-achieving loser, rather I will cut it right down the middle from here on out. Vinnie says October 14, 2009 at 6:41 am Extremely interesting, please do go on! Robert says October 14, 2009 at 6:48 am Very nice. However, I think you miss the point regarding overperforming losers. Many losers realize full well the reality of reorgs, mergers, and layoffs, and know that those who don’t overperform are destined for the trash heap, sooner or later. Sure, corporate loyalty is not absolute, but it is probabilistic. Somebody who works harder is more likely to be retained (assuming they don’t pose a threat to their management). Workers who aren’t sociopathic but want to maximize their employability may wish to remain out of management (to avoid having to fire others or decide their income) and remain overperforming losers to maximize their chance of keeping a job. In tough economic times when jobs are lean only somebody truly clueless, financially independent, or irreplaceable can afford to not overperform (in an effort to become irreplacable). That’s the nature of a rat race. Kelly says October 14, 2009 at 1:20 pm That’s the nature of the clueless rat race ;) The true loser would not work to overperform… just to perform enough not to get fired. Doug says October 14, 2009 at 1:45 pm Robert, You missed the point, over performing losers are the big losers. Either they want to be management, and clueless, or they are leaving money on the table. You are assuming that the Sociopath notices performance. They do not. Losers are pawns. They are taken off the board or added as needed. They are just lines on a spread sheet or human capital. Spend them, save them, or throw them away, just like real capital. From the post “They actually produce, but are not compensated in proportion to the value they create.” By becoming a bare minimum performer you maximize your personal economic benefit. Being an over performer gives money to the sociopaths. You have bought into the over performer myth given to you by the sociopaths. Does that make you clueless? Venkat says October 15, 2009 at 4:42 am This response seems to keep coming up. One part of the answer is that anyone who is actively optimizing at the level of the economy is probably a sociopath. The second is that there has to be an obvious statistical fallacy here. Everybody CAN’T overperform… expectations are set by the best or average (mean/median) and half the people have to underperform the median, right? Pas B says November 6, 2009 at 9:13 am This thought is still nebulous in my mind, but perhaps you might consider the oft turned phrase “race to the bottom” and what this theory might mean when applied to the organization, particularly how it influences the definition of minimal acceptable performance. Does the minimum level keep rising because we keep underbidding each other? (More work for less pay, in an effort to secure our positions. Still the minimum effort losers, but bidding for a decreasing number of positions and/or in an increasing population. Ethan Fischer says November 6, 2009 at 2:19 pm I think the fundamental flaw in the original poster’s argument is the same one that Doug pointed out: sociopaths don’t care about performance. Or at least they don’t care about the performance which the loser is thinking about. Given their mobility between companies, what they really care about is that they look good and have an opportunity to move up. This suggests that the metric we should look at when evaluating performance is not how productive the employee is, but how productive they are perceived to be. This guarantees an average, since all losers will be compared against their peers. Steve says May 14, 2010 at 11:26 am “effort to become irreplaceable” … key word there is “effort” … no one is ever irreplaceable in the business world. Gabri says October 18, 2010 at 8:24 pm even more “The cemeteries of the world are full of indispensable (irreplaceable) men.” — Charles de Gaulle jim says October 14, 2009 at 7:02 am You should offer one on one coaching for us loosers. Seriously. Dan DeLuca says October 14, 2009 at 7:05 am I (foolishly) went to a top-tier business school and (again foolishly) worked for well over a decade at two of the largest banks in the world, as well as a few other organizations, and this is seriously one of the best things I have ever read on management. I wish I had read this 20 years ago! Joe says January 11, 2011 at 2:35 pm I feel the same way. I have been in management as a professional and I never could figure out why work was not rewarded, and why I suspected that top managment was sociopathic in every organization. This is brilliant… Barbie says October 14, 2009 at 7:05 am Need more. Much more!!!! Thanks. John says October 14, 2009 at 7:09 am Fantastically engaging and true. Everyone has played the “which Office character are you?” game, but this takes it to a new level! Nice — and yes, I want more. Dustin says October 14, 2009 at 7:18 am I want more! Lemme hear about Toby & Jim!!! Dave H says October 14, 2009 at 7:22 am To my thinking the interesting thought experiment is “where from here”. I accept your model as predictive and functional, it speaks to my inner cynic, now where from here? How can we/you/I use these insights to improve the model, make better predictions, creat better parody? Regards Stephen says October 14, 2009 at 7:26 am Brilliant. Love it, more, much more….please ! Jay Davis says October 14, 2009 at 7:36 am Excellent, insightful commentary. If you are willing to do the work required, I can only imagine everyone who has read this will implore you to continue your work into the other characters. Matthew T. Grant says October 14, 2009 at 7:48 am Very well written and compelling take on organizational behavior. Also very sympathetic and illuminating view of MacLeod’s otherwise two-dimensional misanthropy. Finally, really like the idea of “capacity for pathological meta-cognition.” room34 says October 14, 2009 at 7:51 am Excellent, insightful essay. So much of both office culture and “The Office” culture make more sense to me in this context. I look forward to future installments! Jrp says October 14, 2009 at 7:59 am Fantastic work, would definitely read more. There is a missing (perhaps irrelevant) element in the equation: you forgot about us contractors. We are transient bare-minimum losers, who either move from place to place with the money, or choose the contract-to-hire route with (real or feigned) Clueless ambition. The transient among us drift from company to company like happy flies in a kennel’s back yard. The money varies wildly, but the freedom makes up for it. Furthermore, the majority of us have one or more tiny business on the side, or are saving up for one risky venture or another. The other day I attended a meeting to “honor” (patronize) a division manager who has been with the company for twenty years. They gave her a pin. She was beaming with pride. The other contractors and I boggled… if we stay with one company for twenty years, we figure they owe us a house each. A pin? Really? M. Pape says October 14, 2009 at 8:09 am Great article! I’m going back through my work history, picking out each of the three types. I’d love to read what you might say about Toby, since your teaser was so effective. Zach Aysan says October 14, 2009 at 8:56 am Bought you a coffee dude. Let me know when the next one is up please! :D Just says October 14, 2009 at 10:26 am Excellent post. I am going to guess that if you do not know what archetype you are most like, then you are probably the Clueless. First, I’d love to see the follow up articles Second, one glaring omission is a discussion on the Michael Scott Paper company break when Michael’s ability to maintain the illusion of loyalty broke as well as Idis’s character as the ultimate soicipath. In the negotiations with Wallace Michael Scott gave a glimmer of understanding the sociopath world when he called out Wallace on the BOD meeting. Matt says October 14, 2009 at 10:40 am Brilliant. I would call it depressingly brilliant but as a self-aware loser I always understood at an instinctive level what you so eloquently describe. Throw in a few case studies and you could expand this into a book. s says October 14, 2009 at 10:50 am This is absolutely brilliant! mother says October 14, 2009 at 11:06 am I really enjoyed the article. Except for the part about wishing to die before running out of money. ;) Please write about more of the characters. Travis Cooper says October 14, 2009 at 11:14 am You are dead on. Great to see others forming the same opinions, but you’ve done such a great job articulating what so many of us already know. Reza says October 14, 2009 at 11:15 am Don’t leave me hanging like that!! That was the most interesting piece of management writing I’ve ever read. You have to write more on “The Office”, if not just for the sake of furthering my cause as a wanna-be sociopath. Vivek says October 14, 2009 at 11:39 am I’ve known this for a very long time (I’ve been working at a big company for the past 6 years) but I have never seen it so clearly and precisely described. I just cant tell you how much this post resonated with my own ideas and what I see on a daily basis. And your command of the english language is just unbelievable. Okay I’ll stop gushing now. Please do follow up with another piece. Vivek says October 14, 2009 at 11:43 am Great work. Bought you a coffee too. (Since I’ve gushed enough in my previous comment, I wont here :)… Aaron Swartz says October 14, 2009 at 12:15 pm Just incredible — let me know if you post more. Dylan says October 14, 2009 at 12:30 pm Wow. That was amazing. I will be signing up for email updates on thsi one, something i have never done before on any blog. GC Seeker says October 14, 2009 at 12:48 pm There is also one more type, namely green-card-loser. Ie one who sticks around so that he gets a green card at some point and then leave to become a financially independent sociopath. One idea that you could write up is how performance reviews, “awards” etc are used to reinforce the farce of the “meritocracy” that the HR division fosters. Former Gannettoid says October 14, 2009 at 12:55 pm The organization I previously worked for backs up everything you wrote. Brilliant. Chris H says October 14, 2009 at 1:07 pm I loved this analysis and would definitely want to see more. There was a job I was working around a year ago that had many people that reminded me of Office characters, but this analysis has helped illuminate some of what were just vague notions of familiarity. I would love to see you expound on the characters individually. Anonymous Coward says October 14, 2009 at 1:08 pm You the man! Great stuff. Dave says October 14, 2009 at 1:16 pm That was amazing. Please more, I’d read an entire series. I’ve also never been so happy to consider myself a coasting loser! Dan says October 14, 2009 at 1:23 pm This has been one of the most interesting and enlightening reads I have encountered in a long time. Please continue! I am curious as to your insights on Jim, as he is quite puzzling. Nate says October 14, 2009 at 1:43 pm Oh yeah…keep this going. I thought we were just getting started when I got to the end. Dave H says October 14, 2009 at 1:48 pm Definitely possible that the system lampooned here is the best it gets. Certainly seems better than more controlled systems where unions and federal law impose their sensibilities. Hate to think we can’t do just a bit better though….. I’m a sociapathic wannabe who checked out early and got lucky as an independant. Cyber Fonic says October 14, 2009 at 2:03 pm Awesome ! I haven’t watched any of “The Office” but your writing about is simple the most enlightened. So much so that I’ll probably want to watch the show now. Anyway! PLEASE write more about it, the stuff, so far, has given me a totally different perspective on the machinations of organisations that I have worked for in the past. Could have really benefited from this article many years ago. Cheers, wineshtain says October 14, 2009 at 2:32 pm I sure hope you’re watching Mad Men (and will analyse it too :) Thanks Meg says October 14, 2009 at 2:43 pm This was a fantastic article and I applaud your ability to so eloquently convey such a unique and interesting theory! It has been my experience that losers find the greatest success working in goverment because it is so beholden to preserving the rights of its employees and upholding certain standards (IE you cant pay caseworkers so little that they qualify for foodstamps!) You virtually have a free pass to do the absolute minimum so long as you are adhering to the code of conduct! The clueless exist but most realize how long it takes to get absolutely nowhere by following the career ladder. The Sociopaths are also present but, fortunately, they need not resort to “cold calculation” to further their sucess b/c the organization has been so thoroughly established it affords little room for innovative ideas. For the losers, success comes simply from embacing the ability to maximize your income while preserving your benefits by maneuvering between various divisions and departments. Thus far, its worked like a charm for a loser like myself! Please, please do another installment! As a fan of the Office, I enjoyed this article on an entertaiment level, as a Sociologist on an academic level and as a participant in the business world, a personal level. You’re correct in that Jim is not so difficult to figure out but what is the deal with Toby?! Venkat says October 15, 2009 at 7:49 pm Interesting that you bring up government. All this logic is upended in the world of government, and another Brit show, Yes Minister/Yes Prime Minister provides a lot of the reasons why. In government, the sociopaths are in the middle, the clueless at the top, and the losers (as before) at the bottom. But that’s another line of thought entirely. Toby: coming up. Heather says October 14, 2009 at 2:54 pm This is fantastic! I just finished watching all of the episodes of the Office and I couldn’t quite place why when I was a student I didn’t quite enjoy it, but I respond to it much more now that I’m a working stiff. Obviously, this is due to my new life in the corporate world. Thanks for this! Chris says October 14, 2009 at 3:04 pm I want more! Put on a podcast and interview the writers and/or Gervaise himself and/or others who study similar patterns. Best- Helga says October 14, 2009 at 3:47 pm This is *absolutely* worth a coffee. :-) Keep it coming! cyanbane says October 14, 2009 at 4:45 pm Brilliant. A Coffee on me for sure. Keen says October 14, 2009 at 5:52 pm As a working stiff sociopath you should buy me a coffee for reviewing your treatise, unless I’m clueless in which case I think you must be using some kind of polite suggestion to befriend me in which case you should buy the coffee, unless I’m a loser in which case I have less than you and so coffee should be on you. PrettySneakySis says October 14, 2009 at 8:36 pm I have been lying awake at night, trying to figure out why I work so hard and feel like a hamster on a wheel. You helped me to arrive at the answer – I am an over-performing loser. I need to become more like Stanley/Kevin and less like Andy. So it’s back to the Sudoku and my cover band! And less time at the office. Thank you! I think you saved me from reaching for the quick solution of anti-depressants. P.S. Coffee’s on me – enjoy! Emlyn says October 14, 2009 at 10:02 pm Brilliant model, love it. (Underperforming loser here) One niggle: You say the clueless layer is there to separate the sociopaths from the losers, because “Without it, the company would explode like a nuclear bomb, rather than generate power steadily like a reactor”. This is kind of a vague reason. I suggest that Marx can help here; straighforwardly, the sociopaths are alienating the losers from their production. That’s the entire point of the enterprise, after all. The sociopaths are rounding up a lot of other people, getting them to do stuff, and taking the majority of the results for themselves. So, the clueless buffer is a great invention in this light. Imagine how crappy it must have been for the early sociopaths, before they figured that out? Other than that, fabulous. cutley26 says October 14, 2009 at 10:20 pm Excellent work, I think that I have spent far too much time on each end of the loser spectrum. Although I have been pro-actively making plans to jump to sociopath. I definitely vote for more profiles. Thanks. jodie odie says October 14, 2009 at 10:38 pm thanks. your writing made my day. Jason Berberich says October 15, 2009 at 7:42 am Great insights. I’ve never seen anyone dissect The Office from your angle, and I find it really thought-provoking. I hope you do dive deeper into each of the characters you listed. There’s a ton of material wrapped up in each one. CR says October 15, 2009 at 9:18 am Who is John Galt? Jarratt says October 15, 2009 at 9:22 am You could probably write a blog solely on the topic of analyzing the sociopathic and clueless nature of corporations and large organizations in general. It’s been said a lot, but this was a really amazing read. Bravo. fogus says October 15, 2009 at 10:20 am Great essay. I’ve been keeping a dictionary over the years of the inhabitants of an IT ecology, but I might just rename it to “A Parade of Losers”. Keep it up please. http://fogus.me/static/it-ecology/ -m dave says October 15, 2009 at 1:01 pm Hello; Thank you for enlightening the experience we all had but didn’t sit down and recognize. I guess something good comes from TV. I have one question: wouldn’t the sociopaths on their own form a pyramid when they get to such lofty heights? There are those destined for CEO/president and those just relegated to sociopath loser / sociopath clueless status in the command and control dimension. Perhaps they flit from company to company if they think they can’t get the head job? If the sociopath’s layer was a microcosm of your pyramid, then wouldn’t every level be the same- each one a mini-pyramid? I guess that is what you are saying, but then the drawing and the description differ. Venkat says October 15, 2009 at 8:13 pm I’d conjecture that a company comprising solely of sociopaths is called a law firm or management consulting firm :) Dan G. says October 15, 2009 at 1:44 pm I once attended a lecture by famous French logician Jean-Yves Girard, who is famous for his idiosyncratic, often rude remarks. He said that there are two kinds of logicians: bureaucrats and small-time crooks. This can be easily and accurately extended to all academics and matches with your clueless/sociopathic dychotomy in the office setting. I am currently an academic, but I worked for several years for a multinational corporation as well, so I have a personal acquaintance with both systems. A similar split I guess you have in churches as well, with the ultimately sociopathic guru/messiah controlling the self-deluded true believers. It is a fairly universal yin-yang-like division. Your third category though doesn’t make sense. There are no ‘losers’ as a category. Your ‘losers’ are either sociopathic or clueless in nature. They are at the bottom of the pyramid, but being at the bottom of the pyramid is contingent on all sorts of circumstances and not only on predisposition. The difference is that the sociopathic-loser (and I use ‘loser’ to mean simply ‘at the bottom of the pyramid’ not a predisposition) has a tendency for a high-risk high-reward strategy whereas the clueless-loser will prefer a low-risk low-reward approach. This is why you eventually end up with more sociopaths at the very top and more clueless in the middle; but you will find plenty of sociopaths in the middle (on their way up or on their way down depending on whether their gambles pay off or not) and perhaps even some clueless at the top. The sociopath is the archetypal Man whereas the clueless is the archetypal Woman. This is why you will find more men/sociopaths who are geniuses but also more who are idiots; more who are billionaires but also more who are destitute; more who are artists but also more who are criminals. This stratification is all simply a consequence of a preference for risk/reward versus safety. I also disagree in part with the connotation of the ‘sociopath’ and ‘clueless’ labels. People who show integrity and dedication for their work, interest in the object of their activity rather than the social framework in which their work happens automatically fall under the ‘clueless’ label in your taxonomy. I think this is more than a little silly. I’d like something more neutral. For ‘sociopaths’ I would use ‘players’ because for them the activity they pursue is simply a means to a socially motivated game with an external payoff (money, power). For ‘clueless’ I would use ‘believer’, because they think the object of what they do matters, so the payoff is intrinsic and not gamelike. This belief can be delusion, of course, but not necessarily. It is a commentary on the state of things in the modern workplace that belief is equated with self-delusion, and perhaps rightly so. But it is not universal, I think. In my work, as an academic (teaching and research) I have belief in the intrinsic importance of what I do, I choose not to be a careeristic ‘player’ although I easily could be, I choose to have integrity and I find massive satisfaction in what I do. I’d like to believe that there are also companies where the ‘believers’ are not actually deluded. Google? Honda? I don’t really know. I would further argue that the player/believer split is the primordial one and it leads to a preference for high risk/low risk behaviour. Both players and believers will seek satisfaction in their activity, and the only way they can derive satisfaction leads to high-risk behaviour for the player. Because the ultimate payoff for the player is not the money or the power but the buzz — this is why the Warren Buffetts of the world are still in the game. And because the buzz, like any addiction, grows less intense in time because of tolerance, and because a bigger buzz ultimately requires a higher risk. On the other hand, the believer finds satisfaction in the actual activity that they pursue. Risk is not just avoided but simply unnecessary. The result of the activity is the payoff. And that activity is not a game. Venkat says October 15, 2009 at 7:46 pm It is pretty clear that we differ at the level of basic philosophical commitments. I do think the ‘clueless’ is a primitive independent type, but we disagree at a much more basic level, so there isn’t much point debating that! Your gendered male/female thing is very tempting and has tempted me before. I am skeptical of the position though, but am not going to touch that can of worms with a 10-foot pole. I like the Girard typology of logicians though :) Dan G. says October 16, 2009 at 12:36 am If you mean ‘debating’ in the usual American sense, i.e. picking nits and gotchas then there never is any point in debating anything. But if by ‘debating’ you mean trying to seek which one of us is right on what points, then of course we must debate. I am reading through the comments posted by your readers and I am frightened by the reaction. A substantial number of them believe now that sociopathic behaviour is the ticket out of loserdom. This is not only morally reprehensible but also false. It doesn’t take a great deal of insight to see that at the bottom of society we find a great deal of sociopaths (players in my terminology) whose scheming didn’t work out. So if you are not going to debate me on this point, if you are very convinced that loserdom is a predestination and a predisposition, then at least let me send a message to all the wannabe sociopath/players out there (who happen to read this comment). There is more room for happiness and satisfaction in being a believer (‘clueless’) than a player (‘sociopath’). Life for those who find value in what they are doing and get satisfaction out of it can be happy, fulfilled and peaceful. All they need to do is find their true interest and vocation — their true belief, not a delusion. The life of the player-sociopath is bound to be a constant war; and because it is a competition, satisfaction and success are not under their own self-control. It is contingent on the failure of the other player-sociopaths with whom they need to compete. It is ultimately foolish to make your own hapiness contingent on the payoff of a zero-sum game. I will grant one exception. I will forgive and understand the loser-believer/clueless who is terminally disappointed by seeking their true calling and failing, who is made jaded by life in a society that is so corrupt that there is no more room for the believer other than as an object of exploitation. This is the context in which The Office happens. But, as I said, it is not and must be not universal. From the point of view of society as a whole, praising sociopathy is a disaster. A society of believers will always thrive and progress; it will be the Utopia. A society of players will stagnate and self-distruct; it will be a Mad-Max style, pre-Hobbesian Dystopia. It is a ‘tragedy of the commons’ type of game played out on a societal scale. So, my dear reader, please don’t give up hope. If you are still a believer, be strong and stay a believer even though for now you are a bottom-of-the-heap loser and the player-sociopaths are wriggling their ways to the top of the heap. Don’t play the game. Vivek says November 2, 2009 at 10:19 pm Dan your central thesis seems to be that the “believer” can and should create happiness by inventing that concept in his own thinking. And your saying thats good enough? Everyone wants to earn enough money to be able to look after himself and his family for life. To be able to do that I dont think you can go any other way except for being a sociopath or player. Creating a happiness based on all the concepts of “hard work” and the “purity of work” while your family isnt cared for is false in any given context. Wake up! JB says November 6, 2009 at 9:09 am Crap, Sneaky Sis stole my line. I too would like to buy a coffee to both of you. I feel like I am at a tennis match agreeing with alternating sides of debate. It is clear that Dan G. is a proud believer and Vivek seems to identify more with the sociopath. A sociopathic life will certainly lead to more excitement/buzz and the opportunity for excess of money. I think a believer would be happier and more self-actualized. Dan G says November 18, 2009 at 2:41 am Vivek, my central thesis is different: Sometimes you can be lucky enough to find yourself in a career where being a believer does not mean being clueless but clued-in, and loserdom comes on the tails of incompetence rather than as a result of calculation. It is true that there is always a vulnerability to player/sociopath infiltration, and it is perhaps as a result of a proliferation of the player/sociopath type that some believers remain stuck in a lost reality (the clueless) and some other believers understand and accept what is going on and withdraw into self-imposed loserdom. The typology you describe is valid in a /corrupt/ organisation and you seem to believe quite strongly that an organisation must be corrupt somehow by definition. That is not the case. I experienced both kinds in my career so no need to try to argue that is not possible. It is. I guess you are stuck in a rather corrupt organisation now (huge corporations tend to be so, indeed) hence the inability to contemplate anything different. James T Kirk says November 20, 2009 at 12:50 pm I think you misunderstood Dan. You seem to assume that everybody hates their job and needs to delude themselves into believing otherwise – that’s false. Brian says December 6, 2009 at 6:17 pm The male/female = sociopath/clueless parallel is bogus. Female powertalk is full of “we are all working together” while male powertalk is full of “I lead/you follow” or “you lead/I follow.” Both assume a style of organization, and reinforce that style. Googler says July 7, 2010 at 2:16 am If you think that people who work at Google aren’t deluded then you need to take a good hard look at what makes Google successful and why their employees work so hard for that company… I will give you a hint: there is no such thing as a free lunch. PrettySneakySis says October 15, 2009 at 2:39 pm Dan G., of the last post: Can I buy you a coffe too? :) Jeremy says October 15, 2009 at 3:52 pm You should connect with the General Counsel of Manpower. See this post on his blog: http://manpowerblogs.com/toth/2009/10/15/mandatory-training-tonight-24/ David Klemke says October 15, 2009 at 8:34 pm As someone who’s just identified himself as a sociopath thanks to your insightful writings I would hope that you’d continue to write more on this subject. There’s nothing like being lightly entertained whilst being educated :) Andy says October 16, 2009 at 2:26 am Are you familiar with the work of Barry Oshry? He uses a systems approach to organizations, and describes the dynamics between (and challenges of) the three types, which he labels Tops, Middles, and Bottoms. I first ran across him in an article in Fast Company ( http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/10/camp.html?page=0%2C0 ) and in a number of books, particularly Seeing Systems ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1576754553/ref=s9_simz_gw_s0_p14_t1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=1RTVR101RX6BA59BBPXT&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=470938631&pf_rd_i=507846 ) Guillaume Theoret says October 16, 2009 at 7:06 am I would love to read any extra articles you’d write on Dwight, Jim, Toby, Michael or Ryan, though I think I’d be especially interested in the Toby article. This was great, thanks! Phil says October 16, 2009 at 10:12 am The Office (UK) is pretty much a one-trick-pony. Funny though it is, it relies on an unnatural and unreal reaction to Brent’s behavior. In real life, people react differently to the way they do in The Office – they are more polite and might laugh politely at his “jokes”. In The Office, the reaction is deadpan, adding to the cringe and embarrassment. Ted says October 16, 2009 at 11:23 am Very clever essay, as long as it’s kept in mind 2 things. First, the Office is like all humor, it relies on exaggeration to make things funny. Thus, your essay has to be read in this context also – as it’s based on exaggeration, it is itself exaggerated. Secondly, it’s important to keep in mind that of all the people described in the essay, the only truly competent ones are the sociopaths at the top, and the low-performing losers at the bottom. Thus, you should be seeing a lot of lateral moving of these types – which you do in real life. The low-performing losers have no control if the org lives or dies, as a result when orgs die, they get dumped on the job market. However, unlike the high-performaing losers or the clueless, I think you will find the low-performing losers are the ones that almost immediately get replacement jobs – and it’s a lot more common than you think for a low-performing loser in a collapsing org to successfully transition to a sociopath role in another org. A couple errors in the thesis, though. First, in real life there’s a lot less promoting within orgs than your implying here. Sociopaths have found that promoting people creates a lot of unintended side-effects. It’s a lot more common today for sociopaths to either simply fire the ambitious losers, or stick them in dead-end environments that cause them to quit. I’ve personally had both types of terminations happen to me, and getting fired from the one job, and quitting the other, were the best things to happen to me – both times they applied jumper cables to my career that was otherwise stalled. Years later I realized in those situations that the sociopaths running those orgs were fully aware of what they were doing, and in actuality were trying to help me. It may seem odd to be helping an employee by firing them, but I’ve played the sociopath role in orgs and I now know it to be true – as you say, the pyramid narrows at the top, and if I have a young, ambitious, intelligent employee, and absolutely no room for them higher-up in the org, I know that they will get a better deal elsewhere. If I can push them out of the nest, they will benefit – and I’ve done it and seen it happen. Another error your making is that of implication – your implying that financial compensation tracks the pyramid. In reality it does not – there’s low-paid sociopaths running orgs out there, and highly-paid low-performing losers. Lastly, many large orgs are very familiar with what you call the MacLeod Lifecycle of the firm, and have structured themselves to avoid it. This is why, for example, the CocaCola company has so many different flavors of soft drinks they sell besides Coke. They know that in the last analysis they have no real control over changes in taste preference among the public, and that outside influences they have no control over can cause the public to shift to a different preferred taste – so they maintain these underperforming lines in case that happens. Nobody predicted the shift to plain water, for example. Jason says November 5, 2009 at 10:31 am Most logical response so far. I totally agree with you. Randy says October 16, 2009 at 11:55 am I think you really have an innovative business book here. You should change the labels for the three groups. And I think you really have more than three groups. But the dilemma and different ways of coping with it is a brilliant insight. Keep up the good owrk. Alex says October 16, 2009 at 11:59 am Brilliant. Please write more. Maybe something about business “self-help” books (In Search of Excellence, 7 Habits, etc.) and other materials aimed at furthering the illusions of the Clueless. howie says October 16, 2009 at 12:11 pm Young Mr. Rao: you are clever and smooth in your insights. I like them very very much. I sense you had a univ. educ’n, wherein there must have been some equally clever and snaky teachers in the po-mo subjects. You imbibed those tepid themes but have seen thru and past them brilliantly (your cardinal virtue). I would like to see you really analyze the ak-ak-ak… (can hardly say it) ak-A-demy. Looking forward to more of whatever one calls what it is you do… signed, “A meta-fan” (Which might be glossed as a breeze that blows from, or at, the behind.) CHeers. khappucino says October 17, 2009 at 8:42 am That was brilliant. Greg says October 17, 2009 at 2:53 pm This is brilliant and I really, really hope you write more Adam says October 18, 2009 at 7:41 am Great read, Venkatesh. And a great final comment, Dan G. Keep it going… Josh W says October 19, 2009 at 3:18 pm Interesting! One thing you might be interested in is the “triage” model by Stafford Beer, which is similar to this, (but with differences obviously): The central layer is there to glue the structure together, by pushing the problem of adaption down to the bottom layer: The people at the top will make mistakes, because they are too sociopathic to truly understand the organisation they are running, and the job of the second layer is to push the requirement of dealing with those problems down to the bottom. They do this by claiming that these things are universal problems to be adapted to, either out of misplaced idealisation of the sociopaths and their structure or misplaced identification with them; “one day that will be me”. Another important part of their job is to cajole and encourage those dealing with the nonsense of the poor decisions to “deal with it”, just sufficiently to get on with their job, but by encouraging them to take the same idealistic but conflicted attitude that they hold. Now here’s where the two models seem to diverge: Stafford Beer’s model (mainly out of pessimism) suggests that the bottom layer will be pushed into total desperation, and yet somehow stay there, without massive external or internal change. Whereas your system recognises that the bottom layer still needs to be functioning, and can’t totally descend into crapness. So how does the system keep going? Well periodically the top decision-making levels are refreshed by someone who actually has a clue about what the company is supposed to be doing. Note that they are not the person who has the most idea of what changes should be done, they are someone who has enough of an idea while still retaining the ruthlessness that will allow the structure to continue. They sit on the bottom level getting experience of how stupid stuff is, only to be catapulted to the top by one simple criterion “tough choices that get results”, that is “working but still sociopathic business strategies”. Now sometimes this goes wrong, with what I call a “Gorbachev moment”, which fits surprisingly well into your system; someone is promoted accidentally purely for insight (as not even the sociopaths realise totally what they are doing) and beings with him a concern for those people at the bottom level, and causes the oppressive structure to collapse. This doesn’t mean the _company_ has to collapse, but the dangerous combination of empowering the loosers and disillusioning the clueless about their previously held “positions” means the basic organisation of the company is wrecked, and their own ideas have to be good enough to replace it. And since they are not pre-prepared for this eventuality they usually just blow up the company, as a variant on the other life cycle. Simon says October 20, 2009 at 3:54 am Beautifully put sir! Keep up the good work Neerja says October 23, 2009 at 11:14 am This is a brilliant post! I’d love to read those essays on Michael, Dwight, Jim, Toby and anyone else- so please post them. I wasn’t as big a fan of the Office before I read your blog, as I am now. Being a big fan of Dilbert, I was taken aback when I read your opening paragraph about how the Office works better than the former- but yu have convinced me. I think the most interesting part is the underlying principle which you have no doubt seen all around. Do keep these posts coming, for the losers and clueless milling around:) Yet Another Loser says October 24, 2009 at 10:15 am Brilliant post. It might not be a one-line blurb that the “clueless” might like to use in intellectual discussion but I feel it is a nuanced analysis of the organization without getting overly academic. I personally love the appellations of loser/sociopath/clueless though I don’t know how the humorless masses with take it. A fun and though-provoking read, Ill be coming back for more : Chuck says October 27, 2009 at 10:42 am I’ve forwarded your post to several people and usually get the same response. “This is funny but true which makes it sad.” and “I’m an overcompensating loser :(“ Venkat says October 27, 2009 at 12:33 pm Well, I’ll count all that as further experimental validation of the thesis. The best humor always comes with a dessert of melancholy in my opinion :S gareth says October 28, 2009 at 2:41 am Fantastic article. Could have done with less introductory material – the analysis in the last half spoke for itself. Indeed, I got bogged down so much at the beginning that I nearly gave up … which would have been sad as the latter half is exceptionally incisive. Makes me really apppreciate the script writers and the actors, too. TC says October 29, 2009 at 3:26 pm Directed here from Reddit. Brilliant article. Looking forward to more. Socioclueless says October 29, 2009 at 3:59 pm A breath of fresh air… your theory is – in places – too good to be false. Will buy The Office to see if they are as congruent as your commentary. If so, they deserve cult status. As to your construct, it is so intellectually appealing, you should consider making it into an alternative management theory. khappucino says November 9, 2009 at 10:43 am Venkat, This is a fantastic example of realist analysis without injecting a value judgement. Most people view this sort of discussion through a (good/bad value) lens…. which distorts the message. Great Job and keep them coming. Ray Huang says November 11, 2009 at 3:37 pm Awesome blog/essay. I think you hit it on the nose. Never before have I’ve never wanted to become a sociopath more than I do now. Brilliant! jb says November 14, 2009 at 2:55 am beautiful work. Ive never watched The Office, but have lived it. As a happy tech-industry slacker-loser of long standing (15 years with a company that ive been with since i was one of three employees), and a long time interested observer-from-the-sidelines – your writings here bring a big smile to my dial. I am on my way out of tech (via the creative-artistic route, funded by the Bargain – with both myself and the sociopaths fully aware of this and acting in a symbiotic fashion) and watching this stuff unfold is better than TV. more, more and more! Stranger On Calm says November 14, 2009 at 9:52 am I’m wondering how the Michael/Daryl meeting (regarding Daryl’s payraise request) might have played out if Michael were a sociopath. I imagine it playing out like this (in individual steps, with Michael’s underlying message(s) to Daryl following in parentheses): Step A: Daryl comes up to the 2nd floor to meet with Michael at a scheduled time. (Michael’s message(s) to Daryl: (1) Michael’s time is important…meetings with him must be set up in advance. (2) This is to be a formal interaction…any buddy-buddy, personal dynamics that exist between Michael and Daryl at other times will not be in play during this meeting.) Step B: Michael makes Daryl wait 5/10/15 minutes (past the scheduled time) outside Michael’s office. (Michael’s message(s) to Daryl: (1) Daryl’s issue, while important to Daryl, is just one of many (important) things that Michael has to attend to during a typical, busy day. (2) (following 1) Daryl’s issue is not the most important issue of the day for Michael, and this meeting can be interrupted at any time.) Step C: Once Daryl is invited into Michael’s office, Michael says “Daryl, I’m extremely busy today. I’ve only got a few minutes. What’s on your mind?” (Micheal’s message(s) to Daryl: (1) re-iterates message(s) communicated in Step B (that Daryl’s issue is not very important to Michael). (2) By giving Daryl a time constraint, it forces Daryl to “talk first,” which is one of Michael’s goals (based on the wikipedia tactics list [Technically, Michael is speaking first; however, I am interpreting the “refuse to speak first” tactic to mean “refuse to speak first about the topic at hand,” in which case, Michael is playing legally since his words are simply setting boundary conditions on the discussion. In fact, now that I think about it, Michael would have his secretary (is it still Pam at this time?) say to Daryl (as she, at last, leads him into Micheal’s office) “I’m sorry, Daryl, Michael is extremely busy today, he only has a few minutes.” In this way, Michael does not have to speak first…Daryl knows there is a time limit and that he must get his arguments out in the open quickly.]).) Step D: Once Daryl has outlined his case, Michael says “Daryl, those are valid points and I understand where you’re coming from…but things are tight right now…I can’t promise anything. But, I’ll talk with Accounting/HR/Corporate and we’ll see if there’s anything we can do for you. Thank you for coming in today.” Michael then buzzes his secretary on the intercom and asks her to go ahead and put that call through that she’s had on hold during the meeting. Daryl stands up and leaves Michael’s office. (Micheal’s message(s) to Daryl: (1) Michael is taking the time to listen to Daryl…He hears Daryl and he validates Daryl. (2) There is a much bigger picture involved here than just Daryl’s world. While Daryl’s arguments for a raise make sense from Daryl’s point of view, the company is a large organization, and all matters of pay must go through a standard process. (3) Michael is very busy, and now that Daryl has communicated his wishes, Michael needs to get back to important matters. Stranger On Calm says November 14, 2009 at 10:37 am Sorry…that last post was supposed to be in the Posturetalk, Powertalk, Babytalk and Gametalk thread. thedancingmachine says November 14, 2009 at 12:42 pm I enjoyed the read (first-time reader) although being a lifetime low-level grunt and loving it I didn’t understand all the words and as usual was to lazy to look them up. I enjoyed that you didn’t appear to be talking down to anyone which is not common among gifted people. Looking forward to reading more of your posts (past and future). OGRE says November 15, 2009 at 11:39 am Brilliant analysis. I look forward to reading your other works. Sean M says November 16, 2009 at 5:27 pm Venkat, you’re a champ, love your work. Looking forward to the next installment/book release. Have you found a publisher yet? Has Ricky agreed to write the foward?? re Dan G and other academic non-nitpicking debaters (?) – holding things up with verbose specificity no doubt helps you and your fellow committee members arrive at an indecision sooner but the rest of us find it glaringly dull. This is a blog not a bog. Dan G. says November 17, 2009 at 11:57 am Thanks Sean for your tl;dr insights. They make scarcely any sense but they are amusing. Well done. Sean M says November 17, 2009 at 6:38 pm No, thank you, Dan G. That means a lot to me because I am, in fact, a comedy writer. I’m working on a motivational/self-help piece called “Failing To Suceed” and the above article covers similar terrain, albiet from a broader perspective. This blog was recommended to me by a friend that works in it (or as he likes to say, “I.T.”) who thought that I, as a dedicated student of The Office, might be interested and I just assumed that Venkat was a comedy writer – no offence, Venkat, but you do have a certain style – and to be frank, Dan, I thought you were some kind of math junkie turned comedy hack heckling for the sake of it. But now, in the sober light of day, it occurs to me that most people on this site seem to be looking for something more than just a few good laughs. And judging by many of these comments, they’ve found what they’re looking for. So thanks again for your understanding and the kind words of encouragement. I’ll leave you to get on with your discourse and be content to follow from afar. Peace. B says November 20, 2009 at 12:24 am Win. Jason Sares says November 16, 2009 at 11:12 pm BTW his name is spelled Darryl not Daryl http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darryl_Philbin H. says November 17, 2009 at 10:56 pm You could have done without portraying the character of Oscar — who has a steady boyfriend — as someone whose “active gay lifestyle” is his main form of distraction. I can’t recall a single episode where that’s revealed to be the case. Meredith is the only character whose loose sexuality is a major part of her lifestyle. However, the word “slut” in your description of her is unnecessary. I stopped reading there. If you want to be taken seriously, use serious language. Venkat says November 18, 2009 at 5:23 am Update, 2012: I modified the bit about Oscar to reflect this comment discussion and his character as it evolved since I wrote the post. I am not concerned about my language since it suits the level at which I intended to present the ideas, but you are partly right about the accuracy here. Mea culpa. I think we agree that my characterization of Meredith is accurate, modulo language. You are right though, that Oscar’s character (unlike say, Jack on Will and Grace) is not driven by his being gay. While the few plots with an active role for him DO center on his being the token gay character, his character does not revolve around his being gay. The problem is that without that, his character doesn’t have any depth on the show at all, except for a mild fastidiousness with budgets. So perhaps I can be forgiven for not reading anything more than “gay” in his character because the writers didn’t write any more into it. Or maybe he is supposed to be ironically-tokenized, so Michael can say things like “your gayness does not define you, your Mexican-ness does.” Food for thought though. Venkat ElCoronel says February 3, 2010 at 10:01 am I would say Oscar definitely exists solely to be ‘ironically-tokenized’ as do most of the characters that sit in that back corner. They have had some development over the run of the show but I suspect mostly to provide new fodder to tell the stories of Michael and Jim. Drew @ Cook Like Your Grandmother says November 18, 2009 at 5:02 pm This is brilliant. For the people trying to figure out which track they’re on, there’s a rule of thumb you can borrow from poker: At any high-stakes game there’s sure to be at least one sucker. If don’t know who it is, it’s you. Chad says November 21, 2009 at 12:51 am Loved it. Finally an explanation for my disjointed CV (short stints selling enterprise software for vc-backed start ups in between my own eBiz start ups) Curtis says November 21, 2009 at 6:25 am A great read! Loved the insight. Please keep it going. It’s interesting to read through the comments and pick out who falls into which category. Seems to me that S & L’s generally, readily identify themselves while the C’s aren’t able to do so as easily. bob says November 21, 2009 at 4:48 pm I’ve never seen the office, but I enjoyed your analysis of organizational communication. Sumana Harihareswara says November 22, 2009 at 6:53 pm Thought-provoking stuff, as you’re already aware. My understanding is that David Simon specifically developed “The Wire” as an argument against loyalty to institutions: “[“The Wire” is] sort of a visual novel. We knew exactly what we wanted to say about the bureaucratic aspects of the drug war. It is about what happens in this land of ours when product ceases to matter, when the institutions themselves become predominant over their purpose. Pick up the paper: You take a job, you go down to Houston, you move your family there, you find out they gutted the company and stole your pension. It’s like whatever you believe in, whatever you commit to that’s larger than you or your family, will somehow find a way to fuck you.” Loyalty to an organization? Identifying with an organization? For a fairly smart hard worker, who actually believes in the stated goals of the organization, it’s fairly seductive, especially if they conflates their specific subcommunity with the institution as a whole. They’re dismayed when they see “politics,” which is when someone else puts personal status ahead of the organization’s mission, even sabotaging useful work to gain or keep relative status. Have you read Peter Watts’s work, such as Blindsight? You might enjoy his slideshow on sociopathy in vampires. Anthony says November 29, 2009 at 2:11 pm Hi, Venkat. I’m just half-way through reading this fascinating, insightful, alarming blogpost. (Work won’t ever be the same again.) I just wanted to point out that it should be “Comparing Michael *WITH* his exiting sociopath peer” (rather than “Comparing Michael *to* his…” — which means almost the exact opposite). Yeah, I’m a coasting Loser pedant. So fire me. Ian Luke Kane says December 1, 2009 at 9:41 am Absolutely fantastic thinking. I’d like to hear your further thoughts on Toby, especially.

Johannes says March 16, 2010 at 7:16 am Absolutly brilliant. I’ve allways dismissed the american version but i’ll probably have a look. Gervais is a genious and after this post, so are you, kindof. Thanks. AnEducatedNegro says March 22, 2010 at 10:20 pm you said you were going to come back to Toby and Jim and then said you weren’t! oh the agony! or are you just trying to find the losers. ahh good ploy mr venkat… Venkat says March 23, 2010 at 4:48 am Patience, patience. I do have a full-time job :) Promises shall be kept. Venkat. ac says March 24, 2010 at 12:48 pm really incredible piece… I sit at my desk and genuinely ponder my fate… nabot says March 26, 2010 at 12:01 pm I just thought about applying this to politics, to the corporate state. Were there is no (easy) bankruptcy. What happens when the sociopaths, overwelmed by the clueless and not being able to keep the losers productive enough, go away for their brighter future in a less public industry ? Of course show must go on. But what happens to the newly promoted clueless when they can’t mimic getting the job done. It’s kind of an inverted dilbert, driven by the sociopaths not being attracted to their positions anymore. Is it possible ? Is it happening ? Because I’m french, and I really wonder if our president being a clueless is only bad luck. (and once again, bravo and more please. I need to improve my gamer talk.) Ashley says April 21, 2010 at 10:07 am Toby is definitely one of the more fascinating characters. I second the notion to write an essay on him. His monotone voice and his perpetual state of depression make watching him akin to watching a snail leave a goopy trail–very uneventful. I am not sure whether he is a loser or clueless, but much too soft to be a sociopath. Steve says May 14, 2010 at 12:19 pm Brilliant! Yes, as others have said before me, your analysis of Toby is long overdue. I’ve always seen him as kind of a tragic anti-hero, one of the few sympathetic characters in the show. Maybe it’s just because I’m an over-performing loser aspiring to the clueless ranks, or maybe it’s because I’ve spent a few years working in HR, but he always strikes me as a fish out of water. He’s the archetypal outsider tasked with reigning in chaos, yet utterly dumbfounded by the level of irrationality he confronts. As you said, he’s smart enough to recognize the ineffectualness of his role, and cynical enough to maintain a certain dispassionate distance from the freak show around him. I’d love to hear your take on his role as the on-premises HR rep. :) PLEASUREMAN says May 24, 2010 at 6:50 am See this article for an extended rebuttal http://www.mypostingcareer.com/forums/index.php?/topic/256-sociopathy-in-organizations/ Dave says July 7, 2010 at 7:37 am The primary purpose of the Clueless is not to be a stable of potential fall guys, that’s just an added benefit. They serve as a layer of abstraction between the source of an organization’s income and the Loser’s constant and rationed paycheck. The Clueless think that they can achieve success by maximizing the metric they are presented with – their laundered paycheck. The nascent Sociopath sees that the paycheck is an abstraction, and makes a decision to break through it as quickly as possible. Velan says July 14, 2010 at 4:57 am Utterly brilliant!! tubelite says July 20, 2010 at 8:03 pm [This has been on the backburner for months; long enough. Out, damned post, out I say! ] I have two bones to pick with your excellent thesis. First, that “losers” have struck a bad economic bargain by not doing the whole capitalistic striving. I presume the whole characterization is tongue-in-cheek, but let me rise to the defense of my fellow losers anyway: People superficially look the same, so one may easily lump them in the same category.

People who have a reason to form a group will cooperate/collaborate best when they have some confidence in one another. People share ideas, projects, and skills, and \"read\" one another and form bonds. This is a social system. It could be a brief association or have a long duration. It could have a formal context, such as a business or a governmental entity. Social interactions build people's confidence and sense of value in the group, in the individuals, and the work at hand. The challenge grows exponentially as the population of the group scales. Communication is hard. An individual's discernment and connectedness (a confidence/value score) within the group will reflect potential for success. Communication matters. The human plot twist is that there can be dysfunctional social systems as well as dysfunctional individuals. For a very serious discussion, the great writer Primo Levi published his reflections on his harrowing experiences. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primo_Levi This related article about social systems and connectedness was also recently discussed on HN with much interest: https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-upstream-cause-of-the-youth... reply AmericanChopper 3 hours agorootparentYou’re reading an awful lot into that person’s question.

A competent person might think they got there on their own and may not be relied on as strongly to take your side in office politics. Of course repeating this process many times rapidly erodes management competence. This simple process is from an emergent behavior of rational actors acting in accordance to the incentives of the structure. Unlike other theories it does not necessitate irrational actors, morons, or sociopaths. Where you have people you have politics so it almost always occurs just at different speeds, hence the pervasiveness and the inevitability of the cycle of collapse and rebirth.

It categorizes how people already consciously see themselves with Carl Jungs archetypes. The main point of the archetype concept is to then explore the part of you that is different from how you see yourself- your “shadow” for the purpose of personal development. It’s not mysterious, mystical, or claiming to be science- it’s just a very simple set of arbitrary categories to give you a different perspective on yourself, and point you in a direction of dealing with things you would otherwise avoid because it’s uncomfortable to think about. For example if you see yourself as “rational” and reject “emotional” thinking, it can be helpful to actually explore your emotional side rather than push it away. The concept itself is a useful and simple thing, but is mostly misunderstood and misused… I don’t see how an employer testing employees would be useful. As someone who has read Carl Jungs books, but has not encountered it in the workplace, it annoys me to see people talking derisively about it from a place of misunderstanding. reply chongli 5 hours agorootparentIt’s astrology because it takes unimodal distributions and splits them into two groups above and below the mean. This is a cardinal sin in statistics because it implies the existence of distinct populations that don’t really exist and so any predictions you try to make are no better than a coinflip. reply UniverseHacker 5 hours agorootparentIt actually does not do that- each dimension which represents two opposite archetypes (e.g. introvert vs extrovert) is a continuum, and the output of the test isn’t actually a single category but a point on that line for each dimension. The full output is actually a 4 dimensional vector. Importantly- everyone has both traits, it is only telling you which you more consciously identify with. Many people will be near the middle and not strongly on one end of a dimension. Again, astrology claims to predict the future based on nonsense. MTBI makes no such claims, it predicts nothing, and it’s chosen dimensions are very transparently arbitrary value judgements, among limitless possible archetypes that one could choose. reply chongli 4 hours agorootparentI think you may have missed my point so I’ll give an example: Suppose you take a random sample of adult humans and sort them by height. What you’ll see is a bimodal distribution which reflects the fact that there are actually two distinct populations represented in the sample: men and women. The sexes can be considered types and you will get reasonably accurate results for predicting height from sex and vice versa. However, if you instead take a sample of only men and sort them by height you will see a unimodal distribution. If you then try to split this sample into two types above and below the mean, you will find that it doesn’t tell you anything! This is what I mean when I say MBTI astrology. The archetypes are meaningless! Someone who is at 51% on the extroversion scale will get labeled an Extrovert and someone at 49% will get labeled an Introvert, but in practice these two are virtually indistinguishable and fall squarely within the margin of error. Since the distribution is unimodal the majority of the population clusters around the means, exactly what you would expect to find with the hypothesis that personality archetypes do not exist. reply UniverseHacker 3 hours agorootparentTo follow on: why does the MBTI focus on 8 specific archetypes when there are limitless others? It is indeed a totally arbitrary choice, and a value judgement. These are ones that Carl Jung thought particularly important based on his philosophy of personal development, and experience as a clinical psychologist. Of the ones Jung talked about MBTI further selected an even more limited set. Personally, I think it is more useful to skip the MTBI and just use Jungs original text. reply UniverseHacker 3 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think I missed your point but you missed mine. If someone is 51% or 49% it is misleading to classify- which is why the test actually outputs a vector. Archetypes are fairly arbitrary concepts that isolate individual aspects among thousands that could potentially explain personality traits- they don’t claim to exist in real people. It is critical to realize that in the dimensions on MBTI everyone is actually both, but some people strongly identify with one and reject or despise the part of themselves that represents the other. reply rbanffy 5 hours agorootparentprevThey just said MBTI doesn’t predict anything. It’s a measurement tool, with limitations, and you should use it understanding those. Much like an IQ test, or a having or not a PhD, it doesn’t hold much predictive power. reply Joker_vD 5 hours agorootparentIf you can't make any useful predictions with it then whatever MBTI measures (or it believes it measures) is... also useless? reply UniverseHacker 5 hours agorootparentI attempted to explain what it is useful for above, but will elaborate. The valuable result is the extreme opposite of your result- it is a therapy or personal development tool that directs you to explore and understand parts of yourself you reject or disapprove of (your “shadow”). It simply quantifies something obvious that you already know: how you consciously see yourself- in a way that guides you to explore aspects of yourself that you otherwise would choose to avoid because it’s difficult and possibly even painful to do so. What it measures is actually pretty banal and obvious if you are familiar with Jungian archetypes- one can easily guess the result for yourself and other people without using the test. reply wnolens 4 hours agorootparentprevThanks, this has given me a new perspective. I went through mbti at a workplace and it was used to give us an understanding of our co-workers. Your point that it's a self assessment and thus only \"how you see yourself\" and not.. y'know, how you actually behave, is in retrospect \"no shit\" but I missed this crucial point. It kind of changes every conversation with anyone I've ever had about our result. reply UniverseHacker 3 hours agorootparentIt sounds like it is being misused and misunderstood in a way that is actually BS. The way it relates to others is more subtle than that: Say someone is strongly extroverted and sees introversion as a negative thing… and dislikes and disapproves of their more introverted co-workers. If they come to explore, understand, and accept their own introverted aspects it will also take the steam out of their dislike for others who show those traits. reply crngefest 11 hours agoparentprevThis is true for every statement about people. reply H8crilA 9 hours agorootparentAnd yet it is not obvious to everyone. reply DaiPlusPlus 9 hours agorootparentI still maintain there are only 10 types of people in the world.

Everything else is fairly flexible, eg you can either put object or subject first (unlike in written English, where the place of the subject is much more constrained). Now, when you have a subordinate clause, written German puts the finite at the end.

I did come away with one useful part of it, and that's 'The Curse of Development'.

I don' think the gervais principle enlightens anymore. I remember thinking it was amazing to see my suspicions laid out like this, but with some time and distance I don't know that I would share it with someone now. why demoralize them. I can see how it's demeaning and feels like punishment to take orders or show deference to someone who lacks heroic qualities, and really we should make a better class of managers, but it is the duty of all prisoners to escape, and they probably won't miss you anyway. there's an aspect of humility that comes from simple competence where all work is \"we make a thing here so our families can eat,\" and if you're on an existential quest for belonging, you're probably not going to provide the value to others that yields the rewards of the business. Sure, money and power flows to some of the least interesting people doing the dullest things, but the dinner party they're boring at isn't the reconciliation or taking account of their course through life either. they do the thing and then eat at drive thrus and watch some tv. meaning for them comes from somewhere else. articles raging against them are dumb and misleading. trying to grind out meaning from every experience is exhausting and ephemeral because meaning is beautiful, but it's rarely shared and doesn't persist. this life is only what we actually do, so do something different. reply rich_sasha 2 hours agoprevI think there are some insightful gems in there, but it doesn't add up to a grand unified theory of management. One company I worked at was ran by a narcissist, who promoted anyone who sucked up to him - the harder the suck, the higher the office. Not because they were underachieving losers or whatnot. And as a result most people he promoted were the Clueless, who genuinely sucked up the nonsense he spewed. The company was, somehow, very successful. Anther company was all sociopath going at 100 mph flat out, hoping to make enough dosh before it all explodes. No losers or clueless on board beyond probation. Another had a great guy at the top, who was seriously nice, competent at the subject matter, and fair and concerned with the well-being of his people, we're all in this together etc. If anything, he was the Clueless. His lieutenants in turn were incompetent sociopaths, busy with keeping him happy while flailing their arms to appear like they are trying to control the chaos, all the time sucking at the teat of the Really Nice CEO. He didn't promote them because they were sociopath, but he promoted them for some reason and didn't have the heart to fire them. As much as I love the cynicism, I think reality is more complicated. But for sure, being a psycho and not actually caring about the work or people is a great boost to a successful career. \"The Office\" analogies are a bit convoluted to me as well. Jim's climbing the greasy pole of company management isn't, to me, embracing Sociopathy, but if anything, trying to make his Loser life more comfortable. Swallow a few stupid company slogans, toe a line, and in return have less work and more money. Not really his opening up to screwing other people or relentlessly jumping ship to a higher position with the competitors. reply fch42 9 hours agoprevA lot of these \"organisational models\" treat organisational behaviour as a kind of game; you can get ahead by exploiting game masters' mistakes, by cheating, or possibly by knowing and playing the rules really well. And just like poker, there's always a supply of those who believe in luck and just go all-in with no plan. While I get that \"as such\", and therefore can follow a classification sociopath/clueless/loser, what is always missing in such models are the people who don't care to play. Those who go to the casino for free food and drinks in order to watch the show, but not to take a stake of their own. Are they \"losers\" because if you don't bet you can't win ? All of those who play, though, actually want these spectators - after all, winning if there's noone looking, is that a win? Personally, I think you have this \"fourth column\" in all organisations. They take their paycheck and deliver something of what's asked for, but else don't care; what they see as \"success\" is not related to organisational structure or behaviour at all. With all the focus on \"success\" and \"promotion\" (or, opposite, \"losers\"), I wonder how much the theorists are missing.

    "originBody": "ENTROPIC ENGINEERING DEFCON 32 STATEMENT A statement from Entropic Engineering on the developing Badge situation at DEFCON 32 (2024) August 10, 2024 Entropic Engineering was approached in January ‘24 by the DEFCON Badge Team, who were looking for a small company to partner with. They expressed that they specifically wanted to work with us as a woman-owned, queer- and POC-driven engineering firm to develop an electronic badge with a gaming element for this year’s conference. The specifics of what they requested in January were extremely difficult / almost impossible, but we had been working with Raspberry Pi as a Design Partner and had early access to the unreleased Raspberry Pi RP 2350, a chip that would enable exactly the kind of device DEFCON was requesting. Dmitry and Entropic had already been working on a GB emulator and were thrilled to be able to contribute our work to a project directly for and by the community. We then approached Raspberry Pi with the idea of collaborating to launch this chip at DEFCON. All negotiations, liaising, and access to RPi was orchestrated by EE. Like us, RPi was really excited about getting this tech into the hands of some of their most enthusiastic community members, especially packaged as a retro handheld gaming device. In many ways, this was a dream project. Despite the near impossibly short timeline to achieve 30k unit mass production, our team of 5 worked tirelessly alongside Dmitry. He handled all of the emulator software while we sourced components, designed all of the hardware, wrote production test software, and organized all circuit board manufacturing, prototype manufacturing, facilitated large volume production manufacturing and logistics, and general project coordination. Through this period, Defcon’s responsibility was the game-specific software, badge accessories (i.e.: plastic case and lanyard), and the printed circuit board artwork including the cat shape, colors, and silkscreen. We were clear as early as our first conversation in January that the risk in trying to push to mass production of this size and on this timeline was immense, even advocating for a DEFCON 2025 release of this particular badge. DEFCON’s Badge Team remained confident that they could meet and mitigate this risk. Once a month, we billed for our work and submitted an updated estimated per badge final cost - committing as costs built to discount our work as necessary in order to hit DEFCON’s per unit cost targets. In June, after 5 months of late night work, badges were fully designed, prototypes were working, and mass production was ongoing with the manufacturers we contracted on behalf of DEFCON. We billed DEFCON for our most recent work, discounting our labor by 25% in order to meet the agreed upon targets. Unfortunately, we were instead met with a work stoppage request and informed we would no longer be paid for services already rendered. At this point, all work had been completed except our physically attending the overseas production run and providing ongoing troubleshooting/debugging. In fact, the day we received this surprising news, we were actively working on the SD card debug that became a central concern earlier this week. Ultimately, DEFCON chose to send a member of their own team to oversee onsite production while EE and Dmitry continued working for free behind the scenes to ensure that the badges delivered to our community would reflect the care we have for our community, this project, and the Raspberry Pi launch. We take responsibility for and ownership of any oversights and mistakes that we have made in this project. We are a small team working with very limited resources trying to accomplish a very difficult project for our community while paying the bills. EE has tried multiple times over the past months to negotiate fair compensation for work completed prior to June 7th, but attempts at resolution have been unsuccessful. Once the manufacturing was fully completed, we were offered a one-time “take it or leave it” amount worth well under half of what we were owed pre-stoppage. Given that what we were owed was already discounted by 25% in order to hit agreed upon cost targets, this has had a huge impact on our small team. We are also still owed substantial sums for parts that we purchased on behalf of DEFCON for use in the badge. Again, all subsequent offers to negotiate a settlement in good faith have not received any productive response. We have also continued to pour lots of time, effort, and love into the project post-stoppage. I want to be clear that we never expected to be paid for this post-stoppage work, but simply did it as a labor of love for the community. The DEFCON community is and has always been near and dear to my heart; I started my local DEFCON group as a kid growing up in Malaysia decades ago. We did everything we possibly could in order to make the badge happen this year as a love letter to the community we care about - the whole team poured everything it had, including many sleepless nights for many many months. I’m proud of my team: we weathered exhaustion, illness, robbery (ask Dmitry), and just about every logistical nightmare possible with the attitude that under no circumstances would we let this fail for a community we love and love being part of. We’re confused by and extremely disappointed in the decisions made institutionally by the conference this year. In addition to the agreed upon monetary compensation (which we have been only partially provided), we were promised visibility and representation as supporters and contributors to the community. Badges for the team (and conference attendance), participation in the Badge talk, and credit in announcements, signage, and on the Badge case were all promised in return for work rendered. We were especially hurt and confused by the conference's choice to revoke all of the above. If, as was offered as explanation, the Badge project was truly out of funds when we were removed, we’re especially curious how many thousands of dollars were then spent on the project of literally and physically erasing our contributions and credit. Modifying a plastic injection mold so late in the game is pricey and additionally risky. While we as a company did not ask Dmitry to program the easter egg, the outpouring of support and community for EE has been appreciated and inspiring. We are especially grateful that Dmitry was not hurt in the physical removal he was subjected to as a result of his demonstration of solidarity. We want to extend our thanks to all attendees who have been asking questions, reaching out, attending surprise side-walk cons, displaying the about page badge on the con floor, and, especially, keeping a community eye on law enforcement and conference security to help ensure our friend Dmitry’s safety in the last 48 hours. The badge circuit board was partly designed by a young EE engineer in South America (shout out to George!). It had always been Dmitry and EE’s goal to use all proceeds after overhead and payroll (which still are recovering) to finance George’s completion of his engineering degree. In fact - this is why we started work on the original pre-defcon uGB gaming device in the first place. Please keep your eyes open in the near future for opportunities to help us meet this goal despite the disappointments and challenges of the past few months. In appreciation and solidarity, M Pang on behalf of the Entropic Engineering team",

To really understand who is right and who is wrong here we would need to read the letter of the agreements between these entities, and cross reference them with facts. Of course neither the contracts, nor the facts are available to us. As is, the best I can do here is to put all participants on my personal “do not work with” list. Who needs the drama. In particular there seems to be at least two points of miscommunication: it sounds like EE were told how much DEFCON can spend per badge. And they took that number to mean only the cost of the board and electrical engineering costs associated with it. Ignoring other costs (lanyard for sure, and maybe the cost of the plastic case too?). The other missed connection seems to be the legal position of the firmware developer. EE seems to say they thought the guy was not their subcontractor but someone working for DEFCON. While DEFCON seems to imply that they thought he was an EE subcontractor. I see a lot comments here with strong opinions on who is right and who is wrong in this dispute. It also seems to be that those strong opinions are based on assumptions. In particular assumptions about what the contract might say, but treated as if it is not a speculation but the truth. That logic is not persuasive to me. reply harshreality 4 hours agoparentExactly. Let's see the formal contract. The deliverables, the payment schedule, and any emails indicating DC agreement to subsequent requests for changes of terms. The way EE phrases it, they were paid much less than they were owed, but owed according to what? Their internal accounting, or what they'd mutually agreed on with DC? Only the latter matters. Emails saying \"it's going to cost $X more\", if any of EE's emails rose to that level of clarity and directness, are legally useless and meaningless without clear assent from DC. reply iwontberude 1 hour agorootparentIf they said it will cost more and DC took delivery, that is sufficient. There is such a thing as unjust enrichment and DEFCON is responsible for paying for the goods and services they receive. You simply cannot stiff someone because the original agreement didn’t include the extra work. As with almost any project, it’s inevitable DEFCON wanted changes and those could make the original contract obsolete. reply red_trumpet 8 hours agoparentprevThe firmware author themselves write[1]: > I was not anybody’s contractor or subcontractor.

But even if I take it as true, doesn’t mean that DEFCON couldn’t have believed he was subcontracting for EE. Similarly if it was DEFCON who introduced the firmware author to EE, EE might believe the firmware author is with DEFCON. Obviously the contracts should be crystal clear about who is with who, and who is responsible for what. We hear that the fimware developer had no contract with anyone. That is very bad. But whose bad it is? If there is a contract between EE and DEFCON which states clearly that EE is responsible for the firmware that is very bad for EE then. If there is no contract between EE and DEFCON, or it is not clear enough who delivers the firmware then that is very bad on DEFCON. (I would be surprised if that is the case, but who knows in this whole mess.) reply threatofrain 1 hour agorootparentWhat's strange is that Dmitry continued to work for defcon after a stop work order, and also that Dmitry was originally invited to speak on stage (smells like consideration). Based on the sum of all statements it continues to be very plausible that Dmitry basically had no on-paper relationship with anyone... and did everything on a pure friends and family basis. If so that is a huge awkward fuckup. Also unfortunate is the possibility that if Dmitry is just some detached party trying to defend Entropic's honor, he basically started a firestorm which burned bridges between Entropic and defcon. Once Dmitry started the whole thing, defcon immediately attacked the reputation of Entropic by saying they exercised bad faith in business and were incompetent and profligate. Defcon attacked so hard that there was no way to unring that bell. Then Entropic had no choice but to respond to defcon. reply ranger_danger 8 minutes agorootparentprev> We hear that the fimware developer had no contract with anyone. I see this occasionally with small companies, usually it's more of a personal request from one of the employees to provide some code on a volunteer basis, perhaps solely because they are passionate about that sort of thing and someone knew that about them. In the end, if the favor is upheld and they provide the code/binary/whatever to the company (who has a contract to deliver such code), then that company's upstream contract is still fulfilled, technically it doesn't matter that the coder was not an employee or contractor. The only real downside I see for this is legal liability for the company if they end up unable to provide for their customer, but that's between the two of them and their contract, the coder is basically not on the hook for any problems. reply echoangle 4 hours agorootparentprevThis statement seems to be intentionally inaccurate to me. He’s not someone’s contractor, subcontractor or employee, but he still has to have someone he’s communicating with about the project, either at EE, DC or both. Why not state what the situation was? Was he working with EEs team, DC directly or did he switch at some point? reply mannykannot 4 hours agorootparentprevIt seems quintessentially DEFCON to infiltrate both organizations by exploiting the breakdown of communication between them. reply flumpcakes 9 hours agoparentprevI think this is a very balanced take and probably one that most people should follow. However, I do slightly favour defcon in this mess - why did Entropic take on a project that was nearly \"impossible\". Why did the firmware engineer add a crypto beg for a \"joke\". reply krisoft 7 hours agorootparent> I do slightly favour defcon in this mess I do favour Entropic slightly. Simply because DEFCON being the larger entity has more power in the situation to dictate terms, and also because the end result favours DEFCON. They have their badges using the work Entropic put into them. But I recognise that this is entirely feel and vibe based. Which is not the proper basis to decide anything. > Why did the firmware engineer add a crypto beg for a \"joke\". He seen the relationship between EE and DEFCON going bad, and decided that it is not okay and took a stance to protest it. Half of his stance was the screen in the firmware, the other half was him making a scene at the main stage. If he didn’t do that we wouldn’t know about the issue. reply echoangle 4 hours agorootparent> I do favour Entropic slightly. Simply because DEFCON being the larger entity has more power in the situation to dictate terms […] If the terms were clarified before the contract was signed, i don’t really see this point. If you sign a contract to do something, it doesn’t matter how much power the other party has. If you don’t like the terms they dictate, don’t take them as a customer. And once there is a contract, the terms should be locked in. reply vextea 8 hours agorootparentprevEntropic wasn't the people that added the hidden screen with the credit reply trickstra 7 hours agoparentprevSo how do you deal with the claim that they were sending regular cost updates and estimations throughout the development? (assuming they really did that). Shouldn't DEFCON stop it as soon as they realized some miscommunication about the price? reply harshreality 4 hours agorootparentDEFCON isn't the entity doing the work. It's up to EE to get DC's clear agreement on changes of terms. Otherwise, EE must either: a) acknowledge that they can't fulfill the contract under the existing terms, and follow the contract's termination procedures b) keep working to try to complete the project, because the agreed upon payment is better, even considering the extra work, than whatever contract termination involved When DC told EE to stop work, they did so rather than say \"everything's fine, we're continuing as agreed\"? That means they knew they couldn't deliver as contracted, or didn't want to because every day they kept working would lose them more money even if they fulfilled the contract. This is why they should've had a reasonable contract that didn't require heroics in order to break even. Because, when things started to go bad, they needed a fallback besides taking a big loss for partial work, and taking a bigger loss for complete work. Or alternatively, they could've reasonably contracted to do something nearly impossible, if they were okay with failing and getting nothing, at least for the r&d portion, turning it into an RP2350 learning opportunity. (Presumably, if they made it to production, the contract easily covered production costs.) reply firesteelrain 6 hours agorootparentprevWe can only take that at face value because we don’t know what contractual communication mechanisms were in place to handle these scenarios. It could EE revising history here. We simply don’t know reply trogdor 4 hours agoparentprev> EE seems to say they thought the guy was not their subcontractor but someone working for DEFCON. I didn’t see that in their statement. reply Aurornis 13 hours agoprevDEFCON’s response was posted on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Defcon/s/NVw5T4LXQR Unsurprisingly, it contradicts some of the claims Entropic has been making. Entropic admits to having exceeded agreed upon budgets by a significant amount, which DEFCON corroborates. There is some disagreement about what has been paid, though, as DEFCON believes they have paid for the hardware development. Some of the other claims also appear to have been exaggerated or at least phrased in misleading ways. The Entropic Engineering logo was not removed from the PCBs. Their logo was not included on the plastics because Entropic was not responsible for the plastics and the initial plan to include their logo was only a courtesy before the relationship soured. The DEFCON statement alludes to budgets being exceeded by a significant margin (not covered by minor reductions in hourly rate as the other statement implied) and even calls out some “bad-faith” charges. I’m also confused about the earlier threats to use the DMCA against DEFCON for using the firmware without a license. As far as I can tell, the firmware was produced as part of the agreement between DEFCON and Entropic, in which case there shouldn’t be much question about the license as it’s a work for hire. Imagine hiring a company to write software to your spec and then to have them later try to claim they’re going to pursue legal action for using the software you paid them to write. Something is strange here. It also appears that the firmware engineer’s dismissal from the talk was communicated before it began, so his choice to get on stage anyway knowingly violated that decision. Regardless of what we think should have happened, getting up on stage after being told not to isn’t going to go well at any conference for any reason. I think there’s a lot more to this story than the initial round of accusations let on. I think the first movers in publishing their narrative often win the public opinion debate, but if even half of what DEFCON is saying is true then Entropic and their team don’t appear to be operating entirely in good faith with the way they’ve handled this publicity. reply gizmo686 12 hours agoparent> there shouldn’t be much question about the license as it’s a work for hire. Work for hire is about employees. Entropic is not an employee of DEFCON, it is a company with a contractual agreement to provide something in exchange for money. The details of when, if ever, IP rights are transferred to DEFCON should be spelled out in the contract. I have seen all sorts of arrangements for that. However, in a well drafted contract, IP ownership probably wouldn't transfer prior to payment. Also, the firmware author isn't an employee of anyone. In a lawyerly world, that would be resolved with a clear copyright assignment or license, but I have no idea if that happened. reply hansvm 4 hours agoparentprev> As far as I can tell, the firmware was produced as part of the agreement between DEFCON and Entropic, in which case there shouldn’t be much question about the license as it’s a work for hire. The default state of things is that the author owns the code, regardless of any contracts between Entropic and DEFCON. He may or may not have signed those rights away, but if his other assertions are true (that he wasn't anyone's employee or contractor) then I'd be mildly surprised if the right legal structures were in place to ensure DEFCON owned the code. That's an issue when writing code for hire too (or, e.g., hiring a photographer). If you're not careful, you don't have very many rights with respect to the final product, even after paying somebody to write it for you. Implied, limited, non-exclusive licenses are a thing, and I wouldn't be terribly shocked if (assuming a judge had to decide) all parties aren't at least allowed to continue distributing the badges (perhaps not to redistribute the firmware itself, modify the firmware, ...). Things get murky in a hurry though, and finding a resolution not requiring a court is probably better for all parties. reply tzs 3 hours agoparentprevTo add some detail to what others have said, to be a work for hire in the US it must either be a work made by one of your employees within the scope of their employment or all three of the following must hold: 1. You specifically ordered or commissioned the work, 2. There is a written contract that states that it is a work for hire, and 3. The work falls into at least one of these 9 categories: • a contribution to a collective work • a translation • a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work • a supplementary work (e.g., foreword, illustration, editorial notes) • a compilation • an instructional text • a test • answer material for a test • an atlas For a long time contract software usually could not be a work for hire because it usually did not fall into one of those 9 categories. I believe in recent years some courts have decided that contract software usually does fall into one or more of them and so can be a work for hire. I don't know if that view has become widespread or is just confined to some federal court districts. Practically what this means is that when hiring a contractor you either put in the contract that the contractor will assign the copyright to you or that you will be given a suitable license to use the code that is pretty much equivalent to owning the code (irrevocable, exclusive, allows making and distributing derivative works, you can sublicense to others on any terms you want, etc). reply parkaboy 9 hours agoparentprev> I’m also confused about the earlier threats to use the DMCA against DEFCON for using the firmware without a license. As far as I can tell, the firmware was produced as part of the agreement between DEFCON and Entropic, in which case there shouldn’t be much question about the license as it’s a work for hire In theory that's true if they legally structured things properly. All comes down to what legal structures were put in place between all three parties starting with the contract (if any) between Entropic and the sub. I kind of agree, but that assumes they all set up their contracts appropriately... which, having been deeply involved in that community for many years... let's just say I could toss a coin about that assumption being true. If the sub didn't sign anything and Entropic/DEFCON just took his firmware and used it (even if that was the contractor's intention), it's still a significant IP liability for whoever was flashing it all. reply gklitz 12 hours agoparentprevnext [13 more] [flagged] krisoft 9 hours agorootparentI don’t understand what is confusing about that part.

If that is true, and they have a contract saying that EE will deliver the firmware to them, and the firmware developer is also right that they have no contract then the problem is with EE. The firmware dev can still sue DEFCON for distributing his copyrighted work without a license to do so. In turn DEFCON would sue EE.

It would be one thing if DEF CON were some superstar artist, where taking the kid gloves off and delivering harsh feedback is part of the learning process, but it’s just a conference organizer. reply tptacek 16 hours agorootparentWho, Dmitry? Dmitry had no arrangement with DEF CON. Entropic? I've been (I think!) where Entropic has been many times, and you've never read about any of them because, like most professionals, I didn't make a huge stink about it. reply threatofrain 16 hours agorootparentIf Dmitry had no arrangement with defcon, why was he invited (looks like consideration), and why did he do work after the request to stop work? Dmitry maintains that he was not doing contractual work for Entropic. Was anything ever written down on paper with regards to Dmitry's relationship to anything? reply tptacek 16 hours agorootparentYou tell me. The DEF CON badge thing is deeply cringe to me. reply adw 16 hours agorootparentprevIs it reasonable to expect better of a prominent institution like DEFCON than from some other typical company? reply tptacek 16 hours agorootparentNo. I have been in (minor, our fault, it all worked out, though not the way I wanted it to) commercial disputes with this organization in the past. They are not fucking around. Look, I've got two things going on with this whole story: First, it's pretty clear that Dmitry (a name I know only from HN from the past couple days) deliberately arranged the showdown with the Goons. He got what he wanted. Nobody should be clutching pearls about his experience on the stage. Second, while none of us know the particulars of Entropic's contracts with DEF CON, and we could still learn new stuff that would make it clear DEF CON is in the wrong, there are a lot of people on HN that are trying to (or aspire to) consulting, and there is something very important to learn from what's happening here: you do not want to do what Entropic did and pick a fight with your client, because (1) you're probably not experiencing something that is that out of the norm for consulting and (2) other prospective clients are absolutely going to take notice. reply threatofrain 16 hours agorootparentFrom what I understand... it's possible that while Dmitry may have wanted to help Entropic, what ended up happening is Dmitry burned bridges for Entropic. Entropic by now has no choice but to come out with a statement since from their perspective, Defcon was already throwing their name under the bus, basically saying Entropic exercised bad faith and incompetence. reply doctorpangloss 15 hours agorootparentprev> They are not fucking around. How would you feel that reading that line of yours made my eyes roll? You’re mocking this guy for creating drama, then you go and say these conference organizers are some dramatic hyperbole. “The only valid drama is my drama.” It’s the pot calling the kettle black! reply tptacek 15 hours agorootparentI mean that they're serious about business, not \"there's a lot of holes in the desert\". reply cayley_graph 14 hours agorootparentprevThis does not seem like a standard way to conduct business to me by any stretch of the imagination, though I don't work in cybersecurity.

Getting stiffed payments is probably the leading cause of \"vendors with a contract dispute\". Go to your lawyer (you do have a laywer, right?) and have them nicely ask for the money before starting a lawsuit for it plus the contractually specified penalties. Unlike a lot of non-paying customers, DEFCON probably has money, so you can rest relatively easy knowing you will see it (plus penalties) eventually. If DEFCON was planning on spending that money someplace else, that is their problem, not yours. reply AtlasBarfed 4 hours agoparentprevOmg, someone didn't follow the rules at a hacker convention! That's what's kind of interesting about this entire drama. The entire conference is based on people that break systems, bend the rules, bask in pseudo outlaw rider cache, and an amorphous alternate shadow moral code. And yet here we have Internet lawyers arguing formal contracts between contractors and suppliers. There's obviously greed involved here somewhere, and someone is being non-hacker-code compliant. To me the public actions with the most scumminess is defcon: using security guards. Reforming molds. Using the produced badges rather than just paper badges. Thin accusations of malware at a hacker conference. C'mon, man! reply waihtis 14 hours agoparentprevThat and this response is filled with appeals to emotion, but extremely thin on any actual details on the contract. I dont know the company but this statement makes them sound like a bunch of amateurs, and I’m now inclined to believe Defcons statement on what actually happened. reply tokamak 9 hours agoprevSeems like they conveniently omitted some facts here. Very fishy. reply commercialnix 14 hours agoprevnext [19 more] [flagged] t0mas88 7 hours agoparentOn one side I understand why a minority owned/driven company would use that positioning as a marketing advantage, and they have every right to do so. But on the other hand I think doing company positioning around gender, race etc is a bad idea. Those factors should be ignored in selecting vendors in either direction. If you want to encourage equality, demand that every vendor has a policy on it and takes steps to avoid discrimination. If many companies do that it will spread quickly. Doing \"positive discrimination\" is not making things better in the long-term. It emphasises differences that should not be a factor and causes more polarisation instead of less. reply nubinetwork 14 hours agoparentprev> Even I, as a gay half-Asian Muslim, not that any of that should matter, feel this needs to be pointed out: How is it not racist and sexist?

If it was an actual level playing field this would not matter but it isn't, and it's not even close. The goal is for those policies to make themselves obsolete (at least where I live there is always a clear cutoff point where they should stop) reply ibejoeb 8 hours agoparentprevThe first paragraph is immaterial to the complaint. I know what they're trying to do, but they don't seem to realize that only a fraction of the population makes evaluations on an identity-first basis. If I were advising this company, I'd point out that this is going to factor into future vetting. No prospective client wants to invite a public flame war over a contract dispute. Nobody wants to be constantly vigilant pending some publicity stunt. A froggy company that does this kind of stuff is probably going to be too risky for a lot of clients. reply yarg 12 hours agoparentprevIt's DEI bullshit, but the biggest problem I have with DEI is the rejection of competence in favour of pandering - and here, they managed to both pander and hire people competent enough to do the actual job. It seems far less toxic to me than most DEI based decisions. Aside from skipping out on the bill, the biggest problem I have here is the incompetence (the same problem I normally have with DEI based decision making). These people are running an annual conference, and not only did they poison their own well (good luck finding competent hardware vendors in the future) but they derailed one of the most interesting scheduled talks at the last minute. People will remember this, and it has the potential to significantly impact next year's convention. reply HeatrayEnjoyer 13 hours agoparentprevLeveling the playing field isn't bigotry.

I will not discredit the competencies of anyone that I hired or will hire in the future. reply DandyDev 10 hours agorootparentThe thing is, there is a lot of unconscious bias where race and gender are taken into account already, in a way that reduces hiring changes for people who are not white cis hetero males. At least that has been the case in the past sadly. So companies are now sometimes over-correcting by applying positive bias towards minorities reply koonsolo 9 hours agorootparentSo you want to make the problem worse by actually giving everyone a reason to believe the white cis hetero males are more competent. Nice one. Edit: Also, do you ask candidates their sexual preference and if their current gender was the gender they were born with? WTF??? reply DandyDev 2 hours agorootparent1. I explicitly didn’t mention sexual preference. The negative bias toward minorities that has historically been part of the hiring process has been based mostly on immediately visible properties of the candidates, like race and gender 2. I’m not suggesting anything to make any problem worse. I was just observing why companies are over compensating. I’m not voicing any opinion on that. But if you want my opinion: we should remove bias from the hiring process as much as we can, either way, so that all candidates have equal opportunities 3. “WTF???” comes across as overly emotional and does not serve any purpose in a leveled discussion reply koonsolo 2 hours agorootparent> I explicitly didn’t mention sexual preference. I based it on your statement of \"white cis hetero males\". That's also why I did the WTF. I agree with you it doesn't serve the discussion much :). > we should remove bias from the hiring process I agree with you on that one. In the end, capitalism will favor hiring for competence and not the other attributes discussed here, either avoiding certain groups or favoring them. reply DandyDev 1 hour agorootparentNo worries! Regarding capitalism favoring hiring for competence, I’m afraid history has not shown this. I’ve seen in my own environment that male candidates were hired where more competent female candidates were available. And this has been consistently shown throughout history. Minorities really did have less chances in the past, despite capitalism. So I think the question is how we can hire for competency while giving everyone equal opportunities. reply amingilani 13 hours agorootparentprevFeedback: I had to read that twice to realize that I resonated with your perspective. reply Fokamul 8 hours agoprev [2 more] [flagged] ksplicer 7 hours agoparent [–] \"I always avoid working with EU firms, they are way too lazy.

There is no other industry where someone could cause so much damage and laugh about it. Least of all because the liability itself would have led to its collapse. Can you imagine a company hired to reinforce a bridge to protect it from damage from a ship instead causes its collapse. How long is that company gonna last? Even if no one dies or is injured it will be run out of business. Only in Tech can such a company not only survive but laugh about it. And that’s even before we get to how amateurish the mistake these guys made was. reply xyst 1 minute agoparent100% agree. As mentioned in another post, the acceptance of this joke award is completely tone deaf. Hospitals, banks, airlines, governments, and of course various IT operations at companies that are forced to use this endpoint security crap and Windows were impacted. Many people suffered degraded quality of care at medical facilities. Surgeons losing access to critical imaging/labs during surgery. Probably many canceled and rescheduled surgeries as well. People’s flights were delayed or canceled. Imagine having to take a last minute flight to visit a loved one on their death bed only to get canceled because ClownStrike shit and incompetent IT departments/CTOs fucked them over. Many people/businesses unable to access critical banking services. Then the amount of lost productivity for office workers. Many hours lost for IT folks, often even working into the weekends. Time lost to dealing with ClownStrike bullshit when that time could have been spent with their families and friends. Fuck ClownStrike, George Kurtz, and this latest clown, Michael Sentonas reply chongli 2 hours agoprevI appreciate that we’re finding the humour in this catastrophe but what about the question of liability? I have seen a few stories on HN of the billions lost by this event but so far not much in the way of lawsuits. What is the situation? Are the licenses so ironclad that customers have no recourse? I could understand this in the case of consumers who might suffer minor inconvenience as their home PC is out of service for a few hours/days but it seems totally unacceptable for industries to accept this level of risk exposure. This is one of the big reasons civil engineering is considered such a serious discipline. If a bridge collapses, there’s not only financial liability but the potential for criminal liability as well. Civil engineering students have it drilled into their heads that if they behave unethically or otherwise take unacceptable risks as an engineer they face jail time for it. Is there any path for software engineers to reach this level of accountability and norms of good practice? reply crote 22 minutes agoparent> Civil engineering students have it drilled into their heads that if they behave unethically or otherwise take unacceptable risks as an engineer they face jail time for it. Is there any path for software engineers to reach this level of accountability and norms of good practice? The problem is that with civil engineering you're designing a physical product. Nothing is ever designed to its absolute limit, and everything is built with a healthy safety margin. You calculate a bridge to carry bumper-to-bumper freight traffic, during a hurricane, when an earthquake hits - and then add 20%. Not entirely sure about whether a beam can handle it? Just size it up! Suddenly it's a lot less critical for your calculations to be exactly accurate - if you're off by 0.5% it just doesn't matter. You made a typo on the design documents? The builder will ask for clarification if you're trying to fit a 150ft beam into a 15.0ft gap. This means a bridge collapse is pretty much guaranteed to be the result of gross negligence. Contrast that to programming. A single \" Contrast that to programming. A single \" they said, \"if you sue us, we will dig so deep into your IT practices that it will be more embarrassing for you than us and show that you were at fault\" But CrowdStrike said this publicly. If they’d privately relayed it to Delta, it would have been genuine. By performatively relaying it, however, it seems they’re pre-managing optics around the expected suit. reply wjnc 18 minutes agorootparentIt’s an argument that hits home at any bigcorp where the execs are entertaining the thought of suing CrowdStrike. Making it public once is a lot more effective than relaying it privately a hundred times. I expect most liability to come from abroad, where parts of the contract might be annulled because not in line with local law. But still I don’t expect it.

Because vendors try to disclaim bet-the-company liability on a single contract.[1] The vendor's game is to make sure the rest of the customer base does not follow this example, because as noted in the linked article while vendors don't accept bet-the-company liability on each contract (or try not to), they do normally have some significant exposure measured in multiples of annual spend.

Crowdstrike replied (publicaly) pointing out that their contract limits Crowdstrike's liability to single digit millions. Delta's move seems like an attempt to assuage shareholders and help the C.E.O. save face. Crowdstrike shouldn't be afraid of Delta. Crowdstrike should be afraid of the insurance companies that have to pay out to those businesses that have coverage that includes events like this. Even if the payout to a company is $10,000, a big insurance company may have hundreds or thousands of similar payouts to make. The insurance companies won't just let that go; and they know exactly what to look for, how to find it, and have the people, lawyers, and time to make it happen. Crowdstrike will get its day of reckoning. It won't be today. And it probably won't be public. But the insurance companies will make sure it comes, and it's going to hurt. reply JumpCrisscross 1 hour agorootparent> the insurance companies will make sure it comes, and it's going to hurt It could be as simple as a reinsurer refusing to renew coverage if a company uses CrowdStrike. reply vladvasiliu 1 hour agorootparentWhich would be funny, since many companies are putting up with Crowdstrike to make insurers happy. reply dredmorbius 24 minutes agorootparentprevAvailability (or not) of insurance coverage is surprisingly effective in enabling or disabling various commercial ventures. The penny dropped for me whilst reading James Burke's Connections on the exceedingly-delayed introduction of the lateen-rigged sail to Europe, largely on the basis that the syndicates which underwrote (and insured) shipping voyages wouldn't provide financing and coverage to ships so rigged. Far more recently we have notions of redlining for both mortgage lending and insurance coverage (title, mortgage, property, casualty) in inner-city housing and retail markets. Co-inventor of packet-based switching writes of his parents' experience with this in Philadelphia: \"On the Future Computer Era: Modification of the American Character and the Role of the Engineer, or, A Little Caution in the Haste to Number\" (1968)(footnote, p. 6). Similarly, government insurance or guarantees (Medicare, SSI, flood insurance, nuclear power plants) has made high-risk prospects possible, or enabled effective services and markets, where laissez-faire approaches would break down. I propose that similar approaches to issues such as privacy violation might be worth investigating. E.g., voiding any insurance policy over damages caused through the harmful use or unintended disclosure of private information. Much of the current surveillance-capitalism sector would instantly become toxic. The principle current barriers to this are that states themselves benefit through such surveillance, and of course the current industry is highly effective at lobbying for its continuance. reply VirusNewbie 46 minutes agorootparentprevThey might find out delta does embarrassing things like not testing out of bounds array access or does global deployments without canarying. reply mc32 52 minutes agorootparentprevThat’s odd. One is an internal process which has no obligation to an external party, and the other one who is specifically responsible for being liable for any repercussions due to deviating from their own SDLC process[1]they totally skipped themselves? If I were Delta, I’d get other affected parties and together sue CrowdStrike and get all their dirty laundry out in the open. [1] I haven’t checked but they used to list all their ISO certs, etc. Wonder if those get revoked for such glaring violations… reply reaperman 45 minutes agorootparentCivil suits focus in a large way on determining how much damage is each party’s fault. So Crowdstrike would be saying “Of this $500M in damages, x% was from your own shitty practices not from our mistake”. Thats why it’s all pertinent. reply MattGaiser 38 minutes agorootparentprev> One is an internal process which has no obligation to an external party Delta has obligations to their passengers and similarly sidesteps screw ups with similar contractual provisions. How much would Delta owe for not following similar IT practices? Do they now owe customers for their IT failings? Should customers now get to sue Delta for damages related to their poor IT recovery compared to other airlines? reply mc32 35 minutes agorootparentSure but that’d be something passengers could bring up in a suit against Delta, not someone like CS, who themselves obviously skipped their own internal SDLC and whatever other ISO certs they prominently advertised on their website. reply jc2jc 14 minutes agorootparentI assume the argument is that if they can show negligence in their IT practices, then the $500 million in damages can't be all attributed to CrowdStrike's failure. reply dredmorbius 23 minutes agorootparentprevCrowdstrike's discovery process would greatly aid in passenger or general-public suits against Delta. reply LordKeren 1 hour agoparentprevThere is recourse, just not for normal people, as you eluded to. Companies are and will be continuing to sue crowdstrike, and based on the papers that crowdstrike has posted, the impacted companies are extremely likely to be successful. It seems overwhelmingly likely that the companies are going to be able to convince a judge/jury/arbiter that crowdstrike acted grossly negligent and very plainly caused both direct losses and indirect reputational harm to the companies. I’m not sure crowdstrike will even fight it, to be honest. I would assume most of this is going to be settled out of court and we will see crowdstrike crumble in the coming years. reply dredmorbius 22 minutes agorootparentNB: alluded, not eluded. reply JumpCrisscross 1 hour agorootparentprev> not sure crowdstrike will even fight it To my knowledge only Delta is suing and CrowdStrike is kicking and screaming about it [1].

Then again, I don’t think many companies are going to be adopting crowdstrike in the coming years, so I suppose their only option is to defend their stock value at any cost while the company recoils reply dylan604 1 hour agoparentprevA lot of companies have insurance on events causing them to lose sources of income. Whether that's farmers having crop insurance, big box retailers having insurance for catastrophic damage to their big box, I would assume there's something for infrastructure collapse to bring sales to $0 for the duration. Even if everyone that was affected sued ClownStrike for 100% of their losses, it's not like ClownStrike has the revenue to cover those losses. So even if you're a fan of shutting them down, nobody recovers anything close to actual losses. So what would you actually propose? Bug free code is pretty much impossible. Some risk is accepted by the user. Do you seriously think that software should be absolutely 100% bug free before being able to be used? How do you prove that? Of course, the follow up would be how clean is your code that you feel that's even achievable? reply Rinzler89 1 hour agorootparent>Bug free code is pretty much impossible. Some risk is accepted by the user. This wasn't your average SW bug, it was gross negligence on behalf of Crowdstreike, who seems to not have heard of SW testing on actual systems and canary deployment. Big difference. Yeah SW bugs happen all the time but you have to show you took some steps to prevent them, while some dev at Crowdstrike just said \"whatever, it works on my machine\" and directly pushed to all customer production systems on a Friday. That's the definition of gross negligence that they didn't have any processes in place to prevent something like this. That's like a surgeon not bothering to sterilize his hands and then saying \"oh well, hospital infections happen all the time\". reply dylan604 25 minutes agorootparent> That's like a surgeon not bothering to sterilize his hands and then saying \"oh well, hospital infections happen all the time\".

There's also stories of people writing on their good leg \"The other leg\" in Sharpie because such moronic mistakes of removing left appendage instead of right. So even doctors are not above negligence. We just have things in place for when they do. Why you think ClownStrike is above that is bewildering. At the end of the day, mistakes happen. It's not like they have denied they were at fault. So I'm really not sure what you're actually wanting. reply ncr100 25 minutes agorootparentprevThe bug was egregious.

That doesn’t currently exist in software. There are also considering how people respond to risk. Consider how sesame regulation led to most bread having sesame deliberately put into it.

And actually, yes many engineering disciplines do change, Civil engineering brings in new construction techniques, methods for non-destructive testing, improvements to materials and on and on, but it doesn't do so like the coked-up industry of software does it in such a free-for-all manner. It's a proper engineering discipline because there's the control, testing the best way to do things and rolling that out. If we (meaning software 'engineers' and I tepidly include myself in that group) had half the self control in introducing insanity like the 10000th new javascript framework to read and write to a database like the 'proper' disciplines do, maybe it would be better because there's less churn. Why does it have to move so fast? Software is diverse and inconsistent and rapidly changing because 'the industry' (coked-out developers chasing the next big hit to their resume to level up) says it should. I just don't agree that we need that amount of change to do things that amount to mutating some data. If the techniques didn't grow beyond what was cool in 2007, or they were held there until the next thing could be evaluated and trained, but the knowledge and process around them did, perhaps we'd be in a better position. I know I certainly wouldn't mind maintaining something that was created in the last decade of the previous millennium knowing it was built with some sort of self-control and discipline in mind, and that the people working on it with me had the same mindset as well. reply gjsman-1000 1 hour agorootparentSimple - if you restrict the software industry, the US loses to China or any other country that doesn’t give a damn. And unless you censor the internet, there’s absolutely no way to prevent illicit software from crossing the border. Would a business get in trouble for using it? Sure. But if all the businesses in your country are at a competitive disadvantage because the competition is so much brighter elsewhere, and that “sloppy constructed” software is allowing international competition to have greater productivity and efficiency, your country is hosed. Under your own theory, imagine if the US was stuck with ~2007 technology while China was in 2024. The tradeoff would be horrific - like, Taiwan might not exist right now, horrific. Regulating software right now would kill the US competitive advantage. It narrows every year - that would do it overnight. The US right now literally cannot afford to regulate software. The EU, which can afford it, is already watching talent leaving. There’s also the problem of the hundreds of billions of lines of code written before regulations running in production at this very moment.

    "originBody": "Stapler: I remade a 32 year old classic Macintosh app ♥ 2024-08-10 • 3 mins read #finder #macintosh #macos #software #swift #swiftui #tasks #workflow A couple of days ago I was reading on Hacker News about a feature in some Linux window managers where they allow collections of tabs from different apps. This reminded me of BeOS, but at the same time it reminded me of an app from 1992 for classic Macintosh called Stapler, and how I’d talked about that and it’s one-time spiritual successor, LaunchList, in the past. These were both similar apps that allowed you to collect and launch all the apps, files, folders, documents, related to a specific task, thus saving time. Or as Ali Rantakari so succinctly put it in 2009: “Opening a Bunch of Stuff at Once on Your Mac”. So over the past day or so I built my own take on this concept for modern macOS! Whilst my app is inspired by both Stapler (right down to the name) and LaunchList, my app adds improvements and features of its own and is more of a hybrid of both. For example, Stapler didn’t have drag and drop and LaunchList didn’t have zero-click auto-launch. My goal was to keep it as simple as possible, but no simpler. To that end, there are no preferences or settings in the app. Full details, download, and usage are at the GitHub repo: github.com/gingerbeardman/stapler Stapler, for modern macOS (14.0 or newer) Tell me more The idea is you set up a Stapler Document per project containing related apps, files, folders, etc. Then you can open them all at once by launching the single document. Each document contains a list of aliases that can be managed, inspected, launched using the app. The key time-saver is that if you launch a Stapler Document directly, all the items in its list will automatically be launched. Cool! Work: text editor, run current game, pixel art editor, bitmap font app, todo list Play: Music app, Hacker News app, Twitter app, script to position windows Movie: run Caffeine to keep your computer on, shortcut to put displays to sleep It’s an odd way of thinking about working on a computer—it’s task-based rather than app-based or document-based. Indeed, some might say it’s an outdated way of approaching things. But I’m always banging the drum about there being so much good stuff that was prematurely left behind along with the memories of System 7 (though I still use that), BeOS, OS/2, Amiga Workbench, GEM and the many alternative desktops of Atari ST, etc. So I thought I’d see if I could walk the walk as well as talk the talk. Details It’s written in Swift and SwiftUI and weighs in at 640KB, about one third of which is a multitude of icon files at many different sizes and resolutions. By creating a Document-Based App you get a ton of functionality for free, such as document/tab/window management, undo/redo (though I still needed to watch for it and refresh the app window), and much more. Dealing with files was both cool and annoying, cool that you can get aliases and bookmarks to files so easily, but annoying that you have to jump through so many hoops to work around the security and sandbox protections and end up having to do file requests in a very long-winded way, and then there’s having to tweak plist entries to give the app just the right permissions. I’m using some features of SwiftUI that mean the app can’t run on anything before macOS 14 Sonoma. All-in-all I’d say modern macOS development is a bit of a mixed bag. Take it or leave it. Icon Given that this was a quick weekend project, I kind of lost steam when it came to the icon. I’d love a better app icon, as well as a specific document icon, so any icon designers can step this way. Bonus tip System Preferences > Desktop & Dock > Windows > Close windows when quitting an application = OFF Then leave the windows of an app open as you quit it. When you next launch the app its windows will restore to their previous size and position. If you close the windows first, then the app will restore to having no windows open. Thanks My good friend Dave Roberts (Serendipity App Company) for brainstorming why it was so damned difficult to get the app to react differently when a document was opened from Finder. Rip it up and start again! To Dustin Mierau for kickstarting this trend of remaking forgotten old apps for modern macOS. And eternal thanks to Chris Patterson and Ali Rantakari for their apps. -- Enjoyed this blog post? Please show some support. -- Comments: @gingerbeardman",

    "commentBody": "Stapler: I remade a 32 year old classic Macintosh app (gingerbeardman.com)182 points by msephton 21 hours agohidepastfavorite61 comments dredmorbius 2 hours agoIt’s an odd way of thinking about working on a computer—it’s task-based rather than app-based or document-based. If I've one frustration with computer interfaces, dating back to the 1990s, it's this. If anything it's become worse with time as apps, both desktop and mobile though especially the latter, become more self-centric, to the point of having their own, non-filesystem-based, data silos. I understand some of the security reasons for this (apps are themselves increasingly untrusted and untrustworthy, and data-sharing is a significant risk). But it is extraordinarily frustrating when trying to work with multiple tools. Modern MacOS is particularly pernicious in that I'm often working between multiple applications, but on the same project, and the friction of raising and lowering all app-associated windows as I cycle between these, often navigating to a workspace I'd not meant to go to, is quietly maddening. The Linux / X-Windows notion of focus-follows-mouse addresses this somewhat. Your current app is whatever the mouse happens to be on top of. On MacOS this simply isn't available, though there are some ... hints of this. E.g., if I happen to have the mouse over a browser window I can scroll that window with the mouse. But if I then, say, hit Cmd-W to close that tab ... suddenly the actually focused app which I'd forgetten about gets a kick in its nethers. This happens to me several times a week, if not per day. I don't know that Stapler is the true solution to this, but it does seem to track in that direction. reply msephton 2 hours agoparentCheck out my comment about Xerox Star & Smalltalk and what Apple missed from their visit to PARC: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41215350 reply dredmorbius 1 hour agorootparentI saw that, appreciate it, and agree ;-) reply crooked-v 19 hours agoprevAny chance this could add launching windows to specific positions/sizes and/or, more importantly, to specific spaces? It still feels nuts to me that we have all this stuff and yet when entering/exiting 'work mode' I have to either leave everything running indefinitely or reposition all my work apps every time I launch them. reply chongli 14 hours agoparentI leave everything running. I have a dozen spaces filled with assortments of windows for different tasks. It’s a real pain because some apps (such as the browser) have windows open on all of the spaces and macOS really doesn’t like it when you have the same application in multiple different spaces. Clicking a link in an email is such a roll of the dice (as to which space I’ll end up in and which browser window will receive the new tab) that I don’t bother clicking and test copy paste the link where I want it to open. It’s especially bad when I need to restart the browser because then all the windows get collected into one space again. Also annoying that relaunching the browser reopens all those windows in the first place. I like the idea of this app for launching a collection of apps together but the application is the wrong level of granularity. I don’t want all of my browser windows at once. I want just one of them along with the windows of other applications that match that task. I bet there’s some combination of tools I could cobble together and customize to achieve this but I don’t want to work that hard at it. I really should be able to just open up a new space, open up and arrange all the windows I want to work with on tasks for that space, and then press save and give it a name. Then I should be able to close that space and reopen it by name any time I like, with all of the windows exactly as I left them, regardless of whether or not any of those applications are open on other spaces. reply msephton 7 hours agorootparentI think this is the dream, but we're paddling upstream here as the OS itself is app-centric and apps are mostly document-centric. Xerox Star & Smalltalk had the task-centric approach and Alan Kay @alankay has said that Steve Jobs/Apple missed that aspect in their takeaway from their visit: \"(they) missed a few things about the GUI. For example, that it had unlimited and persistent “desktops” which could be used to sustain work/projects over time without having to tear down and build up, and without stovepiped apps, etc.\" https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-be-at-Xerox-PARC-w... So happy that I could remember enough of this story to find that link. reply dredmorbius 1 hour agorootparentCrossing the streams (see: , and I know msephton has), task-centric UI seems to me to have traditionally been accomplished on Unix-like platforms through directories (often task/project-related), and Makefiles, which can combine a set of related operations across a large number of tools in a single context. Neither of these are, of course, user-friendly for the vast majority of people. But they do afford some thoughts, concepts, and mechanisms which might be used in task-oriented UI design. reply kevin_thibedeau 2 hours agorootparentprevThe Lisa was doc-centric so Apple definitely didn't miss that aspect. They abandoned it because harddrives were expensive and needed a cheaper base system running single apps off floppy. reply msephton 2 hours agorootparentI think they called them \"contexts\" on Lisa, but as you say it was referred to as document-centric. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1CvRKdV0Ls But Alan Kay was talking about task-centric, not document-centric, which I'd argue Lisa wasn't quite doing fully. Happy to talk about this more if you think I'm mistaken. And you'll need to let Alan Kay know :) reply the_other 12 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. It’s weird because the basic app+window UX in macOS (in which an app can be running with no windows open) implies the task based behavior that Stapler is trying to support. reply msephton 7 hours agorootparentI'm not sure the current app/window paradigm does suggest that, see my sibling reply. reply JadeNB 5 hours agorootparentprev> Also annoying that relaunching the browser reopens all those windows in the first place. This is the browser's decision, not macOS's, though. At least for Firefox, you can turn it off (\"Open previous windows and tabs\" in General > Startup). reply chongli 3 hours agorootparentI don’t want to lose all those windows and tabs though. I guess what I really want isn’t possible without either ugly hacks or a total rearchitect of the operating system: the elimination of the “stovepipe” applications paradigm. Applications should not own their windows, the operating system should. In practice this would mean an application is not a program you invoke by clicking on it. Instead it should be a library you install that tells the operating system how to read, display, edit, and write certain kinds of documents or document-like resources (such as web pages). Then it would be easy for the operating system to offer unlimited persistent desktops that need to only remember which resources are open and a bit of metadata controlling the appearance of each window (position, shape, size, view setting). reply JadeNB 59 minutes agorootparentI dunno—I see the appeal of what you say, but, on the other hand, the closer the OS comes to locking in different things that an app might want to do, the more we risk the iOS set-up where you can use any browser you want, as long as it's WebKit. That is, one unified paradigm is great, as long as you like that paradigm! I guess one can image a \"skinnable\" OS, where the OS enforces, say, one approach to window management on all apps, but there are options for what the One True Window Management strategy is. I'm sure I'm describing something in Linux, but I'm a Mac user and so not used to such freedom. reply msephton 19 hours agoparentprevI would recommend using another tool to script those sorts of changes to the workspace, and then adding that to the Stapler Document. There is an app called Stay that remembers positions of Windows based on the app, title, etc. I used it for a while, but not recently. https://cordlessdog.com/stay/ reply replete 18 hours agoparentprevYou're not alone with this desire, and I still haven't found a good solution. I want to bookmark all apps and windows when working on something and recall them all later when I resume work. How is this not yet a thing when do much real work involves using so many different applications?. There is an app, Workspaces, I think, but it's not useful enough to bother using. Probably should be a macos feature one day reply prmoustache 8 hours agorootparentKDE Activities reply msephton 8 hours agorootparentThere's probably something more comprehensive and recent, but I couldn't find it: What is an activity in KDE and what can I do with it? https://askubuntu.com/a/705835 reply eddyg 16 hours agoparentprevMoom⁽¹⁾ offers the ability to save and restore window layouts, including triggering saved layouts on addition or removal of displays. ⁽¹⁾https://manytricks.com/moom/ reply toomuchtodo 15 hours agorootparent$10 is incredibly reasonable for this product, thank you for sharing. reply eddyg 6 hours agorootparentYou’re welcome. I’ve been a Moom user for a long time, and the craziest thing to me is when they had to change⁽²⁾ from using a miniature rectangular grid for positioning and resizing a window to a slanted hexagonal grid because of a patent⁽³⁾. ⁽²⁾https://manytricks.com/blog/?p=4618 ⁽³⁾https://patents.google.com/patent/US20090300541A1/en reply msephton 7 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if they experimented with adding app/document launches into the mix? Seems like the missing piece. reply mrbombastic 6 hours agoparentprevI also have wanted this for a long time, is there a limitation on macOS that prevents this? It doesn’t sound that hard but maybe if apis aren’t there it is. reply msephton 5 hours agorootparentFirst, make sure that: System Preferences > General > Desktop & Dock > Windows > Close windows when quitting an application = OFF Then leave the windows of an app open as you quit it. When you next launch the app its windows will restore to their previous size and position. If you close the windows first, then the app will restore to having no windows open. reply JadeNB 5 hours agorootparentIn Sonoma, the same preference is there, but it's one level less nested: System Settings > Desktop & Dock etc. reply latexr 9 hours agoparentprev> more importantly, to specific spaces? Apple does not provide APIs for that. A handful of apps control spaces, and all of them by automating GUI actions. reply BurningFrog 17 hours agoparentprevI use Keyboard Maestro to do this for my needs. May not work for every case. reply msephton 7 hours agorootparentCan you say a bit more about how you've set this up in Keyboard Maestro? Thanks reply BurningFrog 5 hours agorootparentSure! I have a bunch on windows in an app, that tend to move to a different monitor after the machine goes to sleep. Each window has a different title, which is something KM can act on, so I've made an action that moves each individual window to a specific place. I've tied this action to Alt-P (for \"place\"), so I can manually correct when they've drifted. So it's not a generic \"put all windows where I left them\" solution, but it's a hell of a lot better than manually doing the same thing several times a day. reply msephton 3 hours agorootparentNice! I do something similar with my laptop using Hammerspoon: when it detects my external keyboard is connected over USB it does some setup for my desk/mobile environment (repositions dock, quits some apps, launches some apps, etc). I manage my windows in quarters and thirds using keyboard, so they don't really move about. reply samstave 19 hours agoparentprevWe might be looking for this: https://github.com/FancyWM/fancywm reply webwielder2 18 hours agoprevMy mind went to http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/simstapler reply msephton 7 hours agoparentYou're not the only one!

Or even Automator scripts? reply webwielder2 6 hours agoparentOne could do anything far less conveniently. reply create-account 4 hours agoparentprevAn Alfred workflow reply msephton 2 hours agorootparentIndeed that would work but it is definitely more difficult to set up and maintain. New workflow (enter data), new action (enter files). And so on. But I do love Alfred! reply mwcampbell 5 hours agoprevI wonder what the executable size of the original app was. Of course, 471 KB for a modern app, including both x86-64 and ARM64 builds, is pretty good. reply msephton 2 hours agoparentStapler 1.1 (1993) is 223KB (68K-only) LaunchList 0.8 (2009) is 880KB (Intel-only) ...but interestingly LaunchList contained an unused \"test\" icon file weighing 320KB(!) so really it is 560KB. reply vcool07 4 hours agoprevI'm always curious to know whats the motivation behind these kind of side projects ? Is it just to scratch a technical itch ? To build a product for oneself because you are not really happy with anything else on the market ? Learn a new skillset ? Enhance the resume with a new cool project ? reply tgsovlerkhgsel 4 hours agoparentAt least for me, side projects are just another hobby. Some do woodworking, some garden, and very rarely is a hobby actually about the product. Most IT people around me, like myself, enjoy building things. A side project is a good opportunity to do so \"just because\", without bullshit you don't like - no bureaucracy or approval, no story points, no project meetings, no design documents, writing tests and documentation is up to you. You just sit down, do, and get the feeling of actually making progress in a reasonable time and at the end of the day, having built something. It's energizing. Sometimes, it is about the product though, and you build yourself a nice tool because you aren't happy with what's out there. Of course, the two goals can often be combined - and at the very least, some useful product is a good excuse to practice the enjoyable hobby. reply msephton 2 hours agoparentprevFor me it was to scratch the itch of creation. I live for the buzz of creation. There was also a degree of wanting to see how it was to create an app using the latest tools that I don't normally use, I link to a tweet where I suddenly decide to try and make this app, a flash of inspiration that it should be possible. If it had been more difficult, I would have surely given up and the app would not exist. But it was \"easy\" enough, and here we are. Plus, the original app has been stuck in my brain for a long time and I remembered it fondly. So, there are many factors... but adding things to my resume is not one of them. reply iambateman 17 hours agoprevThis is really cool — I’ve wondered why something like this didn’t exist for a long time and I’m looking forward to checking it out. Thanks for filling in the gaps for all of us who don’t just use one app at a time! reply msephton 7 hours agoparentPower users of the world, unite! reply rcarmo 10 hours agoprevI like this. Curious as to how it plays along with the mess that is Stage Manager… reply msephton 7 hours agoparentDo let me know! For my sins, I've never used Stage Manager. reply rcarmo 6 hours agorootparentWell, right now the app itself doesn't work for me. I create a new document, drag a couple of images onto it, save the document, and it goes blank. I tried adding a folder and Visual Studio Code as the things to open (because Visual Studio Code can open, well, anything, and this way I could at least start up a workspace) and got the same result. reply msephton 37 minutes agorootparentThis issue has been resolved in version 1.1 reply msephton 5 hours agorootparentprevI can't reproduce this, but it's been filed as bug on GitHub so I'll look into it. https://github.com/gingerbeardman/stapler/issues/3 reply keyle 10 hours agoprevHow attractive was the old UI?

[1]: https://bunchapp.co/ reply msephton 7 hours agoparentThanks for sharing! This is new to me. The documents saved by Stapler are also plain text (JSON). But because the app is trying to be a model citizen in the current model of macOS security/annoyance, it contains the file bookmarks that macOS gives us (which are binary blobs encoded as Base64 text, so incomprehensible to mere humans) rather than the human-readable file paths you might expect. Kind of annoying, but there we go! reply sublinear 14 hours agoprevIf anyone uses KDE Plasma, you probably already know how broken activities are.

I've had a desire for something like this (windows/linux) -- what would be cool is if it knew the window size and layouts? So you could do a launch group that will do the whole desktops workspace - and can be saved (but also has a reset button to snap back to the layout if you mix things up. Support for a second desktop to launch then to - so you can throw one context cluster on each...) --- Weren't you the one who lost all their archive content? What was the timeline with all of that? reply msephton 19 hours agoparent [–] If you quit and relaunch the app with windows open it will remember its documents positions and sizes. That function comes for free with a Document-Based App. If you want the Document to control the properies of the desktop, then I would write a little Automator app, shell script, Shortcut, etc. to do that and then add that to the Stapler Document. Use all available tools together. --- Internet Archive: yes, that was me. Most of my account data is still gone. I don't think the deleted data will ever be restored. And so it goes.

Photo: Supplied/ Dan Bailey Analysis - Artificial intelligence-enabled cameras on billboards, in bus windshields, on petrol station forecourts and in the checkout at the supermarket - all these are here, or about to be. The selling of surveillance for safety and security's sake has been very successful around the world, and in New Zealand. It has proceeded apace, with barely a blip - though just this week a legal challenge to it has been playing out in the Auckland District Court, without any coverage by the media. In that hearing, expected to involve at least four separate criminal cases challenging police use for evidence of footage gathered without a warrant from CCTV retail cameras linked to automated number plate recognition (ANPR) systems, the ruling was reserved. Another wee blip came after RNZ reported last year that new billboards at Wellington's train stations would sport cameras from the same Swedish company that supplies surveillance products to China. In a quick-about, the billboard company ditched the cameras. MetLink began installing large digital billboards at Wellington railway stations last year, despite not being aware of the cameras embedded in them. Photo: RNZ / Phil Pennington A third speed bump came just last week, when NZTA deferred using number-plate spotting cameras on a highway (see below). The march is mostly one way, though - including to the bank for the tech-makers and marketers, who are known to protest at the media calling their products \"surveillance\". Such sensitivities have not put off governments spending on public-private hybrid systems. New Zealand has its own, used by powerful state agencies, the police and Immigration. Many of the camera systems could run facial recognition (FR). Sometimes you are just asked to trust the FR function is not switched on. A quick swing-around what we know about the surveilled society: Buses - This is the latest. San Fran company Hayden AI that puts car-identifying cameras in bus windshields and has teamed up with big public transport contractor, NEC New Zealand. They are marketing their product to ping drivers crowding bus-stops, bus lanes or cycle lanes, as a road safety tool. Automatic Number Plate Recognition CCTV systems - At least 5000, and possibly up to 10,000 or more, privately owned CCTV cameras nationwide are linked in to two separate privately owned AI-enabled systems for recognising number plates. Police officers tap into this when investigating retail and other crime. Your local council quite likely has some of these. Rollout - since 2015. Airports - Customs is regularly upgrading the facial recognition technology at its e-gates, it checks your face against your passport in less than a blink of an eye - though the biometric data is then held for three months. It has just put out a tender to add a biosecurity function. ANPR on Transmission Gully - The Transport Agency wanted to put ANPR cameras at either end of Transmission Gully motorway near Wellington, to record vehicle travel times in order to see if the road was being run sweetly by its private operator. The question of the plates captures being matched back to the Motor Vehicle Registry remains open - as does whether NZTA will actually go ahead with this, after deferring it at the end of July. Rollout - 2024, but deferred. Billboards - The latest can watch you as you go by and tailor their ads to suit. The country had at least 1400 high-tech billboards last year; it had at least 49 that also have number-plate recognition cameras to count cars (not identify their owners, the operators insist). Some malls have smartscreens that can gauge your mood. Bodycams - Police still do not have these, but prison guards and checkout operators do. Woolworths rolled them out at almost 200 stores in April, with footage downloaded and stored by Singaporean company CSE. Rollout - 2024. Speed-safety cams - The new speed cams going in on highways are powerful enough to see inside your car, and smart enough to send what's wanted back for analysing by AI. Driver on the phone, ping. Not wearing a seatbelt, ping. Waka Kotahi swears this will be used judiciously. Rollout - tests from mid-2023. Congestion charging and tolling - The cameras and new back office tech for these will ensure all that data you generate every day moving about is not lost to the ether, but stored, possibly anonymously, somewhere, possibly in a cloud-computer hypercentre in Sydney or Canberra, for help in generating the next business case. The CCTV room at an Auckland business association, in May. (File photo) Photo: RNZ/ Finn Blackwell Cameras are not quite the least of surveillance, but are only one part of it. Another is the spread of systems that do not rely on cameras but surveil anyway, collecting data on you about where you go and what you do, and storing it and possibly sharing it, under agreements and contracts aimed at protecting your privacy and keeping your profile from becoming a tradeable commodity, though that has not worked so well elsewhere, such as on social media platforms. Such as: Cobwebs - the virtual equivalent of spying with cameras, this tech has been surveilling people's social media for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's MI intelligence unit, to deter boatpeople smugglers, it says. The ministry is in the market to replace it with similar tech. Rollout - 2020. National Ticketing Solution - This will get you on a bus or train anywhere by scanning your phone. The quid pro quo of any such convenience is always control - that you pass control of your travelling data over to state agency NZTA, and its contractor, Cubic, which happens to have a defence surveillance and reconnaissance arm. Though it seems there is always room for more surveillance, it is not as if New Zealand has eyes everywhere. Other countries are much closer to blanket coverage. Of the billion-plus CCTV cameras in the world, China has the most, the US an awful lot, and Africa not many. While by some rough estimates New Zealand has one camera for every 12 people, Shanghai has one-for-two. A crucial development is that public agencies used to buy the hardware and run it, and so keep the data in-house; now they often buy in complete packages in a build-operate contract with the tech company that often harvests and stores the data. Just as there has been software-as-a-service (SaaS) for a while, there is also now surveillance-as-a-service. Again, it is convenient, and the proliferation of this new type of SaaS did not get in the way of New Zealand recently signing up to a US-led 'Joint statement on efforts to counter the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware'.

The country had at least 1400 high-tech billboards last year; it had at least 49 that also have number-plate recognition cameras to count cars (not identify their owners, the operators insist). Some malls have smartscreens that can gauge your mood. Hah, Minority Report is here. Digital signage around me tailoring ads to my preferences is a freaky idea though, will they start showing me \"Hot singles want to date you\"? I suppose they'll be able to scan the crowd and see who's the richest^W who's the easiest to pry money from and then show an ad targeted to them. And a network of these cameras can conceivably even identify where I live and work (\"We see this face shopping at this supermarket most weeks\", \"most mornings we spot him at this coffee place\"), and by doing so guess my income and spending levels. And scanning cars is an interesting idea. \"It's a Cybertruck, show the ad for the penis-enlarging pill!\". reply hammock 4 hours agoparentI worked with a vendor who has installed cameras at the doors of hundreds of bars that use facial rec to count the number of people entering and exiting, and their approximate age and gender It was all sent to a real-time dashboard, and pretty interesting reply euroderf 4 hours agorootparentDoes it also pull up their social credit scores ? reply hammock 4 hours agorootparentAt sports venues and in Vegas it does.

GDPR is a joke due to its lack of enforcement, and I'd argue it gives people a false sense of security. Not only we have (non-compliant) consent flows that destroyed user experience everywhere (without improving privacy in any way, since again they're not compliant and not actually designed to give you privacy), but the lack of enforcement means companies can now claim various things as GDPR compliant, knowing full well nobody is going to actually examine this claim (and if they do, the resulting consequences will be negligible) to give their users/customers a false sense of security. reply fsflover 9 hours agorootparent> GDPR is not a good start.

You can't have a good enforcement without implementing a reasonable law first, which GDPR is. reply talldayo 14 hours agorootparentprevYour comment makes it sound like everyone's PII just spontaneously generates itself on platforms. The problem is that it's not how it works; individual action is what puts your information on adversarial platforms. Personal privacy is the sum of your actions, and the steps you take individually to not share your details with hundreds of people goes a long ways stopping that. If you want to scare businesses, ban arbitration clauses and other self-absolving Terms of Service.

Of course it doesn't appear \"spontaneously,\" it's the result of your actions and others' actions, hence the \"cabin in the woods\" solution. The commenter is implying that expecting each individual to carefully act to preserve their online privacy clearly isn't producing good outcomes, and would like to see collective action through regulation to encourage better outcomes. > If you want to scare businesses, ban arbitration clauses and other self-absolving Terms of Service. That is one potential way to implement the suggested \"hazardous material\" policy. If storage of any data opens a business up to legal action with teeth then they'll stop risking the storage of such data outside of when the benefit to them outweighs the potential risk. Ideally the risk would be such that it becomes standard practice to process data on-device and design protocols and services such that only the absolute minimum required amount of information leaves end-user devices. reply eltoxo 8 hours agorootparentMy understanding of data fusion is that it wouldn't matter much what you do.

The cameras are often only slightly hidden. The problem is knowing what is being done with the data. Where the data goes and how it is used. You don't know who has pictures of your face, your current location, or a list of people with your religious beliefs/habits/likes/dislikes/political beliefs. The combination of those items give people a motive and opportunity, and the only thing that is lacking is a choice of weapon. People have been mass murdering others over their political beliefs since forever. Poisons are a covert weapons, and car accidents can be created. It is conspiratorial to think this way, but it is naive to look through the history until even recent years to dismiss these concerns. reply StanislavPetrov 14 hours agoparentIn retrospect I'm glad I spent the last 20 years wearing a hat and sunglasses virtually everywhere. reply soulofmischief 6 hours agorootparentI quite enjoyed being able to mask up with sunglasses and a ballcap during the pandemic.

If someone can surveil nearly all but nearly all can't surveil the small cohort who surveil them than forces are not balanced. Surveillance per se might be useful, let's say you want to know how much live traffic is there in your planned trip, alerts for incidents, natural phenomenon and so on. The issue is just the balance of forces and what can be done in case of unbalanced forces those who hold the knife from the handle side. reply mylastattempt 10 hours agoparentBalance is definately not _the_ problem. I am not willing to exchange my information for access to someone else's information. Both should be private. reply thro1 10 hours agorootparentI would just have access (control) to my information which I don't have (at all or anymore) but others do (often wrong). reply kkfx 6 hours agorootparentIt's not enough: let's say you have signed XML transactions from your bank, so you own your accounts because you have a provable balance and transactions in your own hand, but... You still know just you. The bank knows the finance of anyone, so it can makes informed decisions you can't make. Let's say you downloads all news articles you read in an accessible, searchable etc format, let's say a feed reader storing posts, and them are full articles in the feed, plus you have historical archives downloadable like old usenet exports. You still get only certain news, others have access to much more news so might know things you do not know and decide to not publish them to take advantage other all the others... In finance there is insider and outsider training defined and forbidden for a reason, but nothing exists for information. Alphabet or Apple have an immense knowledge from iOS and Android users any of their user have not. How easy for them could be find talents in schools thanks to their education penetration and an ads at a time convince them to take a certain path they like, not necessarily the child like, than hire them while pushing others let's say uni students of some humanities with ideas they dislike in bad roles? What if the owner of an insurance company is also the owner of an insurance comparison service? We can't rule nature, we can't design a forever perfect society, but as much fairness there is as much positive evolution for all we might elicit. As much as we came back to feudal like society as less positive evolution we might hope. Of course owning our information, like our home, car, .... is MANDATORY but far from being sufficient. And actually if you see trends... The 2030 Agenda where \"you'll own nothing\" it's already there in the IT world, it's already there in modern connected cars and so on, it will be there soon in the whole society and that's the topmost asymmetry of information and ownership we can imaging. reply kkfx 6 hours agorootparentprevIt is, because the willingness it's largely irrelevant, there are countless information about you left here and there. Of course ideally we have to choose a trade-off between the need of sharing and the will to keep things private, but the point is what we really have or not. I like having Google Street View, I do not like have my gate on it but that's the trade off, I like Street View so I have to accept having my door on it as well. The point is who own what. If StreetView is like OpenStreetMaps it's a thing, if it's a private service where the owner decide what to keep and what to publish than there's a problem. I like being able to see my car's cam from remote, but that means others cars owners will see me walking around as well, that's an acceptable trade off if it's balanced (anyone can see his/her own car's cams) it's far less acceptable if vendors can see and sell streaming cams, owners depend of them to partially see or not their cam streams. reply fsflover 8 hours agorootparentprevWhat if you could always find out who and why accessed your information? Also, all \"private\" information is leaking from time to time... reply kkfx 3 hours agorootparentNeeded (partially) but far from being enough. Let's say you are a big-edutech player, you have all infos collected by your platform on your infra. Even if children and families know what you have and \"why\" [1] they can't know you send an ads at a time small bits of information to drive the scholar path of talented children you plan to hire tomorrow or you try to push some students with political/philosophical ideas aside to avoid having them as active adults against you. Long story short: - we, of course, need personal ownership, the opposite of modern IT where most info are in third party \"cloud\" hands and users have just some modern dumb terminals \"endpoints\" to interact with third party services who own their digital lives; - we of course need to know where our information go but it's not enough, we need information fairness. OpenStreetMaps might have someone using data for certain business purpose, that's still fair, since anyone else can use and own the same data, it's a choice do it or not. Google Maps it's not. Google is the owner, others are customers. If we share anything or nothing or anything else in between accessible to all or to no one, we are in a balanced situation, there will be some who takes better advantage than others because they understand how to do and they want to do so, but it's still a fair situation. Otherwise it's a recipe for a dictatorship witch we can more and more call \"a corporatocracy\". -- [1] a small anecdote: a leading Italian bank years ago decide to ditch RSA physical OTP to access their services mandating a mobile crapplication, I file a formal protest asking for GDPR information and aside noticing they allow operation from mobile, de-facto nullifying the third factor witch is against EU laws (largely ignored the PSD2 norm mandating a separate device for auth and operation), they answer me after a significant amount of time politely that: - they do ask camera permissions because the app allow to scan Qr codes form various payment systems and for live chat (see below), for similar reason they need gallery access; - they do want speaker because in-app they offer live audio-video chat assistance so their operator can talk with their customers while being able to see and act on phone screen; - they need to access filesystem because they allow their customer to pay some bills sent via pdfs by mail or downloaded anyway from some portals, their app need to allow the user select them to being automatically processed; - they need precise position and phone sensors to being sure it's me acting on my device and not a remote attacker; - .... Long story short there are gazillion of plausible reasons for this and that, but I can't know if there are ONLY such legit use of my information or not. I can't be sure even with mandatory AGPL on all systems, because I might have the sources, but no way to be sure their are the very same actually running on their servers. reply blackeyeblitzar 16 hours agoprevOne alarming method of surveillance I learned about this year was cars. Many cars come with built in surveillance and privacy violations. Several manufacturers allegedly sold the location data of car owners, tracked by their GPS systems (https://fortune.com/2024/07/26/general-motors-honda-and-hyun...). Some manufacturers revised their policies based on outrage, like GM (https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/gm-killed-program-that-sold...), but my recollection is others like Subaru did not. Many cars also have options for opting out of having your personal data resolve to data brokers and insurers but they opt you in by default. reply nonrandomstring 10 hours agoparent> One alarming method of surveillance I learned about this year was cars. And robot vacuum cleaners :) Although there's some hostility to cybershow here I'll reference a couple of episodes because surveillance is a frequent talking point. In this [0] one the discussion is exactly what you're talking about.. cars, and the incident with Tesla employees sharing 'funny' road traffic accidents. In this other discussion about CCTV in general [1] two notable things came up: 1) From a security POV, there's an impotency of digital surveillance. It is a tool that works well as post-facto analysis (such as arresting a bunch of rioters the next day). But it has less value in real time unless you also have human resources - and in most cases (except in dangerous war zone) if you already have them they're superior to any electronics. 2) Communities are sold surveillance by an \"insecurity industry\". It's a big business. But they rarely reflect on its value or other effects. Surveillance is a sign of poverty if you take all quality of life factors into account. Overt security signals inner insecurity and social decay. The more cameras you can see in a place the 'poorer' that neighbourhood since a truly wealthy society is one with high trust.

(Not wishing to be pedantic for its own sake, there's an important distinction) High-trust is the average trust metric between any two randomly chosen individuals from the set at some time.

What do you make of that Given that what happens is what is allowed by the society in which it happens, the priority is to flee - as fully bad indicators are there.

Dignity. Privacy is a tangible and common talking point. Anyone who wants to flee to a forest hut can obtain privacy, but not dignity, because escape is undignified. While the concept of privacy makes it into laws, it's still just a minor component of a broader \"dignity\" that so many technologies seem set on destroying. A dozen or more major thinkers since the 1900s have noticed that human dignity is very fragile in the face of technology (Weber, Marx, Fromm, Freud, Jung, Nietzsche...) Surveillance is just one modern facet of undignified life with technology. Question: can technology ever enhance dignity? We've seemingly built a system (society) in which material and social success hinge on a willingness to forgo dignity. People who have a strong sense of dignity are disadvantaged and marginalised. So to answer your \"to where?\" To the margins. Unless one is prepared to embrace indignity in visible opposition.

If accidentally frozen, neffy can be thawed and administered. [1] The need to keep Epi-Pens below 77 degrees F (86F for short periods) is extremely constraining for something that you are supposed to carry with you at all times. Even keeping it in a jeans pocket next to your skin may not be acceptable, technically. If it's hot outside, you can't leave it in your car or even in a bag you're carrying. You're supposed to carry a thermos bottle with you the whole day every day or something? Obviously very few people do that. This is going to be far better for that reason alone. And double the shelf life is very welcome too.

Also see https://www.foodallergy.org/fare-blog/expired-epinephrine-ca... > Forty EpiPen and EpiPen Jr auto-injectors that had been expired for 1 to 50 months were tested. All 40 auto-injectors contained more than 80 percent of the labeled dose reply modeless 17 hours agorootparentProbably true but needs proof. They need to test and re-certify the existing devices for higher and lower temperatures, but they had no incentive to do so before there was competition. Hopefully this will be the swift kick in the butt they need. reply ralferoo 10 hours agorootparentThere's little point in re-certifying, because if the pens only contain 80% of the dose in these conditions, they will almost certainly fail the certification in those conditions. They presumably contain the dose they do to ensure that device is as safe as possible - so that it's high enough that it can save the patient in almost every case but low enough to not cause other issues or side-effects. What that third-party test shows is that if all you have available is a supposedly 4-year past-expiry pen and it's been kept at all the wrong temperatures, you should probably still use it in an emergency because there's a good chance it will still work. Not a big enough chance that they recommend using expired pens, but enough that if the choice is probably dying or using it, you absolutely should use it. reply modeless 10 hours agorootparentOf course you should try an expired EpiPen if that's all you have during an emergency. But that doesn't mean you should ignore the storage temperature requirements for EpiPens, even if they are currently a bit conservative, and Neffy's better performance in high temperatures is a huge advantage. reply labster 16 hours agorootparentprevWhy would they retest and recertify so they can sell half the product they used to sell? What company is crazy enough to lose that much money? reply modeless 16 hours agorootparentThis is a medical product. It's sold for like 100x cost. It'll still be more than worth it. reply tgma 14 hours agorootparentAssuming they were going to do that, it'd likely still be much cheaper to trade the old one in and discard it and get a new one. reply retSava 5 hours agoparentprevThe needless part is the one I think of first. Our daughter is 10, and as soon as we bring up \"here's an injector\" to school personnel or friends parents when she's staying over, there's a frightened look in their eyes. This will allow us to be much more relaxed, since the risk of anyone panicking when administering is lower, the risk of doing it wrong is significantly lower, and the stigmata is also lower compared to a needle. I've been eagerly awaiting this. reply mrbombastic 5 hours agorootparentnit: stigmata -> stigma. reply Wevah 1 hour agorootparentYes: “Stigmata” is the (a) plural of “stigma”. reply sweca 17 hours agoparentprevI have anaphylaxis and I highly disagree about the needle being insignificant. It can be and has been a huge cause of inaction due to fear of feeling and misplacing the needle, e.g. puncturing a vein. I think both can be true: the additional shelf life is fantastic, but so is the needle-free usage. reply tomatocracy 9 hours agorootparentI also have anaphylaxis, use epipens and have never worried about hitting a vein. I don't think I've ever felt the needle when I've used my epipens. But I do think the needle worries other people who might have to administer it to me though and maybe makes them a bit more reluctant to do so. Going to hospital afterwards (to be monitored for late phase reaction and receive high dose antihistamine and hydrocortisone) usually seems to involve putting a cannula in my hand for IV medication which is pretty well guaranteed to be much more unpleasant. reply fluidcruft 15 hours agorootparentprevIt also looks to be much smaller reply modeless 15 hours agorootparentIt does look a whole lot smaller than an Epi-Pen in its plastic case. But Auvi-Q (existing epipen alternative) is also much smaller. I don't see any pictures of the neffy case; surely you have to carry it in a case just like the others. Edit: Found a picture of an official case. Carries two doses and looks roughly similar in size to two Auvi-Q doses: https://andersresearch.substack.com/p/aquestive-therapeutics... I bet a third party could make a smaller case than that, though. I also expect that neffy is much lighter, as Auvi-Q has a battery and a speaker and a needle and a spring and whatnot. reply fluidcruft 15 hours agorootparentGood point. Neffy is said to use the same hardware narcan uses, and some googling of images for narcan just has it inside a tear open paper/plastic laminated wrapper. reply makeitdouble 14 hours agoparentprev> Obviously very few people do that. The hard part being, front the patient POV we didn't know if it's in excess of precaution or something really critical. There's a decent selection of thermo cases that are small enough to make it manageable, but it's definitely a complicating factor, especially for smaller kids. reply LUmBULtERA 8 hours agoparentprevI wasn't aware of the relatively low max temp spec of the epipens. Yikes, a big thank you for pointing that out. reply ezoe 13 hours agoparentprevThe needle-less part is important. In my country, injecting a drug via needle is a medical activity only the patient himself, doctor and the nurse instructed by doctor can perform by law. For EpiPen, the regulation is slightly relaxed so the paramedics, parents/childcare workers/school teachers responsible for the child patient can also use it. But when the EpiPen is needed, the patients often can't administer himself. reply viraptor 6 hours agorootparentWhich country is that? reply jasinjames 20 hours agoprev> ARS Pharma will offer neffy at a price of $199 for two doses via digital pharmacy sites like BlinkRx and GoodRx for eligible patients whose insurance plans do not cover neffy. Some commercially insured patients can access the treatment at $25 for each filled prescription of two single-use neffy devices through a co-pay savings program. This is considerably lower than the non-insured cost of an Epi-Pen or generic equivalent[0]. Hopefully this spurs some competition and makes the whole market more affordable. I needed to use an Epi-pen in college, and though I never took issue with needles I'm glad than an alternative is available for those fearful of them. (I didn't feel it. I was about to pass out. But I remember looking up from the floor while administering and seeing my RA terrified. He was so scared of needles that if I had lost consciousness, he wouldn't have administered for me!)

[0]: https://ir.ars-pharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details... reply jawns 20 hours agoparentprevThis is HUGE for kids. Nasal spray as a delivery method is a big step up from needles, the shelf life is much longer, it's less susceptible to high/low temperatures, and if the promotional pricing is accurate, it's cheaper than EpiPens and Auvi-Q (which talks you through the injection procedure).

There’s nothing surprising about people growing up from this and not trusting medical experts. reply recursivegirth 16 hours agorootparentIt depends, historically vaccines have been administered by injecting dead bacteria/organic matter that triggers your auto immune system to start generating the anti-bodies needed to fight whatever is being vaccinated against. Irrelevant to the topic, COVID vaccines were developed with new technology that uses synthetic materials. I am over simplifying a lot here, but the point is that sometimes you need to get that dead matter into the bloodstream to start the auto-immune processes. reply odyssey7 16 hours agorootparentHistorically, yes, but these days it seems more like a question of priorities. To your point, it does depend: there are needle-free options available for some vaccinations currently, though in many cases children are nonetheless forced to take the version that they beg to decline.

You seem to have some interest in avoiding the truth and facts, which is odd. AbstractH24 17 hours agoprevMy first question is what took so long? For epilepsy, rescue meds to prevent one seizure from triggering another have started coming in the form of nasal spray for at least 5 years already. Before that, outside of hospitals you either had to put a pill under someone’s tongue or cream in their butthole. You couldn’t put it under their tounge during a seizure out of risk they’d bite your finger (I’m currently recovering from a tongue bite I got after having a seizure while alone 8 days ago & it’s pretty miserable. Amazing the amount of power the teeth/jaw can have) and let’s just say the butthole option is unappealing. My second question is should I invest in the company? This seems like it has the potential to sell a ton. And if margins are anything like the nasal rescue med for epilepsy they are massive. The epilepsy nasal sprays are about $300 each without insurance, the same med in pill form is about 10 cents. (Yes, I’ve struggled a lot over the years with the level of privilege and inequality that having access to them reflects/perpetuates.) Their stock has tanked since going public for reasons I’ve yet to find time to research. reply icegreentea2 16 hours agoparentI'm 90% sure that the SPRY stock history before fall 2022 is actually the stock history of Silverback Therapeutics (trading at SBTX).

I only know of their existence because I’ve used them for epilepsy personally. Are there any other contexts they’re used other than that and now this? They’ve obviously been used outside of emergencies for decades. If it was completely revolutionary when it was brought to market for epilepsy then it makes sense. reply icegreentea2 16 hours agorootparentFrom digging, Valtoco (the epilepsy nasal spray) was the second drug approved using \"intravail\", an excipient used to boost drug absorption through the nasal membrane. Valtoco was approved in 2020 (drug approval was submitted in 2018-2019 and fast track granted back in 2016/2017), with a development cycle that appears to have started back in 2007/08. The first drug approved using intravail was tosymra (for migraines) and was approved in 2018. Intravail itself seems to have been around since at least 2006. This drug (neffy) also uses intravail. I would speculate that intravail (or an excipient like it) is probably required for rapid/acute/emergency situations. My expectation is that the first approval of a nasal drug using intravail would have greatly reduced the hurdles for any subsequent drug. reply AbstractH24 16 hours agorootparentFascinating, thanks for taking the time to look into it reply AbstractH24 16 hours agorootparentprevIs there any reason to think that the idea of epi-pens in nasal spray form could only have been conceived of after rescue meds for epilepsy in nasal spray form were approved by the FDA?

The reasoning I've heard is since Epinephrine constricts blood supply to the region and you can kill the tissue in an area with small blood vessels like your fingers. Anyone aware of what the risks of a spray would be in similar contexts? I imagine stabbing a finger is not a risk here, but what about the spray getting anywhere other than the nose like in eyes etc....

I find it rather obnoxious that every child who may need epinephrine is supposed to keep their own device at school — this means that each student needs an extra device, and most of them just sit around until expiration. If the school could buy and store a reasonable number (funded, on a fractional basis, by the insurers of the students who need them) and use them as needed (with replacement paid for by the recipient’s insurance), the students’ lives would be simpler and a lot less money would be spent. reply vlovich123 19 hours agoparentDon’t those students still need the epipen when they’re at home or otherwise out of school? reply ryan-duve 18 hours agorootparentYes, but in addition to the one at home we also have to buy a separate one to sit in the nurse's office all year. Also, if the before/after school program doesn't have access to the nurse's office, we have yet another one that sits in their cabinet, too. They all come home at the end of the year, expire, repeat. reply jessriedel 18 hours agorootparentI don’t understand what the plausible alternative policy is. Each kid needs a personal one for when they are at home. They presumably should bring it with them to school for quick action and also for if they have an episode while commuting. The school could decline to carry them to save a bit of money each year, but it seems unwise to rely on (1) kids never forgetting their medication and (2) an adult always knowing where to find the child’s medication if they are unresponsive. So shouldn’t the school have a few? reply maxerickson 5 hours agorootparentTheir complaint isn't that the school is stocking them. Their complaint is that each child that needs one available is required to provide a personal one to the school to store for use in case they have an emergency. So instead of the school managing and restocking a reasonable number, the parents restock one each year. reply sigseg1v 4 hours agorootparentWouldn't the \"reasonable number\" to stock be the same? Let's say there's 8 kids that need the EpiPen. If there was a food allergy incident, it could be something like a school lunch event which means they need at least enough for every kid since they might all get the same reaction from all eating the same food. From reading these replies it looks like you need 2 for each person just in case they require a second dose, and replace them once a year. So: - if school stocks them for 8 kids: they need to replace 16 every year - if the 8 kids families supply the stocks: they need to, in aggregate, replace 16 every year Same amount. Obviously better if the school pays, but I'm not understanding the \"reasonable number\" part. reply maxerickson 2 hours agorootparentWhere did you come up with the kids all having the same sensitivities? A kid that regularly eats peanut butter but is very sensitive to bee stings doesn't need to plan to avoid strawberries. And at some point, training the on site responders to inject from a vial is going to be pretty worthwhile. reply jessriedel 2 hours agorootparentprevI see. Yea I mean it depends on how many kids need them. If it’s just one or two kids, I don’t see how to avoid it. reply ec109685 18 hours agorootparentprevEvery school should have a supply, period. Also makes sense for kids to carry. reply makeitdouble 13 hours agoparentprevI see the cost part, but on managing the devices it would either require: - centralising all the devices in one point and have one or two trained professionals do the injections, which means a significant delay in case of emergency - or training every professor to do injections, which isn't hard in theory, but time and cost consuming, puts more burden and restrictions on the staff (how do you deal with a 60yo math teacher who just wants to teach and not manage health emergencies ?) And we're not going into the kids and the school staff properly communicating to get the person in charge to shoot the pen when the kid feel they need it. reply amluto 5 hours agorootparentSchools already have to solve exactly these problems. Kids with known anaphylactic reactions have an epinephrine autoinjector and possibly a little pack of antihistamines in a baggie, with the kid’s name on it, in the school nurse’s office. And there’s a piece of paper (generally a standard-ish form that may or may not be comprehensible) with specific instructions for that kid. This being America, the kid’s doctor absolutely does not take the time to write clear instructions for that kid. The only thing that I’m suggesting should change is to have a pile of epinephrine auto injectors (or nose sprays) supplied by the school, so the parents would instead just supply the instructions. reply viraptor 6 hours agorootparentprev> how do you deal with a 60yo math teacher who just wants to teach and not manage health emergencies Is that an option?

    "originBody": "AMD’s Strix Point: Zen 5 Hits Mobile August 10, 2024 clamchowder 12 Comments AMD’s Zen line has gone a long way since it brought AMD’s CPU efforts back from the dead. Successive Zen generations delivered steady improvements that made AMD an increasingly dangerous competitor to Intel. Zen 5 is the latest member of the Zen line, and hits the market at a point when Intel has plenty of troubles of their own. Here, we’re analyzing the Zen 5 architecture as implemented in the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. The HX 370 is a member of AMD’s Strix Point APUs, which combines Zen 5 cores with a RDNA 3.5 iGPU and some AI stuff. Prior Zen generations saw their mobile versions launch well after the architecture debuted in desktop products, so it’s interesting to see Zen 5 do the opposite. The test system Acknowledgments We would like to thank ASUS for providing a laptop for review. System Level Strix Point implements 12 Zen 5 cores in a dual cluster configuration. A high performance cluster has four “regular” Zen 5 cores and 16 MB of L3 cache running at up to 5.15 GHz. A second density optimized cluster has eight Zen 5c cores and 8 MB of L3 running at up to 3.3 GHz. It’s a continuation of AMD’s mild hybrid strategy, where different cache sizes and physical implementations help the company optimize multithreaded performance while keeping area under control. It contrasts with Intel’s hybrid strategy, which uses different core architectures optimized for high performance and high density. All cores within a cluster cap out at the same clock speed. That should simplify OS scheduling decisions, because any of the high performance cores will reach approximately 5.15 GHz. Clusters referred to as P and E for brevity. Clock speed estimated using dependent integer addition latency Intel’s Meteor Lake in contrast benefits from a bit more scheduler awareness because two of its high performance Redwood Cove cores can reach 4.8 GHz. Other Redwood Cove cores cap out at 4.5 GHz. Like Strix Point, all of Meteor Lake’s efficiency cores cap out at the same speed across a cluster. Both of Strix Point’s CPU clusters are tuned for responsiveness, and waste little time getting to their maximum clocks. Even the density optimized Zen 5c cores can reach their modest 3.3 GHz boost speed in less than two milliseconds. Asus has opted to give the HX 370 a 128-bit LPDDR5-7500 setup, providing similar theoretical bandwidth to Meteor Lake’s LPDDR5-7467 with the same bus width. Strix Point’s CPU clusters each have 32 byte per cycle ports to the network-on-chip, which AMD calls Infinity Fabric. Infinity Fabric on the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 runs at up to 2 GHz, much like desktop Zen 4. Per-cluster bandwidth limitations are similar. Read bandwidth from a single cluster caps out at just under 62 GB/s. The memory controller has a bit more bandwidth on tap, but you’ll need to load cores from both clusters to get it. Unlike desktop Zen 4, Strix Point’s CPU clusters have 32 byte per cycle write links too. Per-cluster write bandwidth is therefore capped at 64 GB/s, rather than 32 GB/s on desktop Zen 4. Meteor Lake can just about saturate the memory controller from the CPU tile, indicating its link to Intel’s Scalable Fabric has more bandwidth than Strix Point’s CCX to Infinity Fabric link. The bandwidth gap narrows if traffic is evenly mixed in both directions. Still, reading from DRAM using both clusters at the same time gets more bandwidth. These network-on-chip bandwidth limits are unlikely to be a factor, as low-threaded applications tend to need less bandwidth. Meteor Lake’s design also demands more bandwidth from its cross-die link because the bulk of its CPU performance is concentrated on the CPU tile. Cache coherency operations like lock cmpxchg see higher than expected latency when crossing cluster boundaries. This core to core latency measurement usually returns numbers under 100 ns for desktop CPUs, even when crossing die boundaries. The Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 uses a monolithic setup, so higher latency here is a bit surprising. For comparison, the Ryzen 9 3950X keeps cross-cluster latencies in the 80-90 ns range. Both setups enjoy excellent core to core latency within a cluster. Zen 5 Core, High Level Zen 5 is a significant evolution of the Zen line. From the cpuid instruction, Zen 5’s family is 1A in hexidecimal. To use AMD’s typical terminology, Zen 5 is a member of the 1Ah family (h stands for hexidecimal). Zen 3 and Zen 4 were identified as 19h, while Zen 1 and Zen 2 were 17h. The CPU family reported by cpuid isn’t always significant. Intel for example identifies everything from the original Pentium Pro to Golden Cove as belonging to the 6h family. In AMD’s case though, Zen 5 sees substantial changes over Zen 4. Giving Zen 5 a different family designation definitely seems appropriate. While Zen 5 inherits characteristics from Zen 4, just about every part of the CPU’s execution pipeline has changed substantially. The branch predictor is more capable and gets a victim-cache BTB setup. The fetch and decode stages are arranged in two clusters. The out-of-order backend shifts towards unified schedulers on the integer side while doing the opposite for floating point. Memory accesses benefit from larger TLBs and a bigger L1. And of course, Zen 5 is wider and has more reordering capacity than its predecessor. Branch Prediction AMD had an excellent predictor since Zen 2, and that predictor has gotten even better over time. Zen 5 continues the trend, building on top of Zen 4’s already class leading predictor. AMD needs an accurate branch predictor to make the most of a wider core with more reordering capacity, and Zen 5 doesn’t disappoint. It can recognize extremely long patterns, and is a solid step above Zen 4. Zen 4 is itself a good step above Intel’s current P-Cores. Branch predictors have to be fast in addition to being accurate, because the whole point of branch prediction is to mitigate frontend stalls caused by branches. A cache of frequently used branch targets (called a BTB, or Branch Target Buffer) helps with speed, and is especially useful if instruction bytes have to be fetched from higher latency L2 or L3 caches. Zen 5 moves into the company of cores like Golden Cove with giant BTBs. AMD’s latest BTB arrangement is unique because the last level has fewer entries than faster levels. I can’t think of any other CPUs that use such a BTB setup, but it makes sense in the same way having less L3 per core than L2 is fine. BTBs are caches after all, just for branch targets instead of data. AMD and others have used L3 victim caches for data in many CPUs. Now, AMD’s branch target caching works the same way. Targets evicted from the 16384 entry L1 BTB to make room for incoming targets are filled into the L2 BTB in case they have to be used again soon. The net effect is Zen 5 can track 24K branch targets, and sometimes more. Each BTB entry can hold up to two branches if the branches reside in the same 64-byte aligned cache line and the first branch is a conditional branch Software Optimization Guide for AMD Family 17h Models 30h and Greater Processors Optimization manuals for prior Zen generations indicated that a single BTB entry could store targets for two branches provided certain conditions were met. Perhaps we’re seeing that capability apply more broadly with Zen 5. Besides high branch target caching capacity, Zen 5’s predictor deserves recognition for how fast it can go. The first BTB level can track up to 1024 branches and handle two taken branches per cycle. AMD is not the first to release a core capable of sustaining two taken branches per cycle. Intel did that with Rocket Lake, and Arm did the same with Cortex X2. But Zen 5 joins that party in style, achieving that speed across a much larger branch footprint than either Neoverse V2 or Golden Cove. As a cherry on top, Zen 5 does that while clocking above 5 GHz in a mobile form factor. Returns are predicted by a 52 entry return stack, which appears to be duplicated for both SMT threads. It’s substantially larger than the 32 entry return stack in prior Zen generations. Clustered Fetch and Decode After the branch predictor decides where to go, subsequent frontend stages fetch instructions from memory and decode them into the CPU’s internal format. Zen 5 arranges these fetch and decode stages into two clusters. Each cluster can fetch 32 bytes per cycle from the 32 KB instruction cache and decode up to four instructions per cycle. Together, the decode clusters can handle eight instructions per cycle. Superficially, Zen 5’s frontend looks like the ones in Intel’s latest E-Cores. However, they don’t work the same way. Each Zen 5 cluster only handles a single thread, and maximum frontend throughput can only be achieved if both SMT threads are loaded. Intel’s scheme has all clusters working in parallel on different parts of a single thread’s instruction stream. Mixing taken branches into the test for Zen 5 doesn’t improve throughput as it did with Intel’s first generation clustered decode implementation in Tremont. Therefore, Zen 5 is likely not using branches to load balance between the two decode clusters. To further speed up instruction delivery, Zen 5 fills decoded micro-ops into a 6K entry, 16-way set associative micro-op cache. This micro-op cache can service two 6-wide fetches per cycle. Evidently both 6-wide fetch pipes can be used for a single thread. Zen 5 can sustain higher instruction throughput than Intel Meteor Lake’s Redwood Cove P-Cores, but only for small instruction footprints or when both SMT threads are loaded. If only a single SMT thread is active, Intel’s larger 64 KB instruction cache and conventional 6-wide decoder can hand it a lead when code spills out of the micro-op cache. Because x86 is a variable length instruction set, instruction cache bandwidth can become a limiting factor before the decoders do. Zen 5 and Golden Cove are practically immune to instruction length issues when they hit their respective micro-op caches. AMD’s slides suggest the L1 instruction cache can provide 64 bytes per cycle, but I was only able to get half that even with both SMT threads loaded. If code spills out of L2, Zen 5 can still maintain respectable frontend bandwidth. However, bandwidth is definitely better if you can use both SMT threads, suggesting there’s a limit to how many L1i fill request Zen 5 can queue up for a single thread. Rename and Allocate Operations from the frontend need backend resources to track them and enable correct out-of-order execution. Zen 5’s renamer is 8-wide, making it 33% wider than Zen 4’s 6-wide renamer. With every other stage in the core at least as wide, that means Zen 5 is an 8-wide core. The renamer is also a good place for tricks like move elimination or zeroing idiom recognition. Both can expose more parallelism to the backend, and even avoid consuming backend resources like register file entries. Like prior Zen generations, Zen 5 does plenty of this.Zen 5 IPC Zen 4 IPC xor r,r 5.01 7.4 (2T) 5.92 mov r, 0 5.5 3.93 sub r,r 5.01 7.38 (2T) 5.94 xor xmm,xmm 4.99 6 (2T) 4.16 sub xmm,xmm 5.01 7.48 (2T) 5.94 Independent MOV r,r 5.01 7.44 (2T) 5.94 Dependent MOV r,r 6.65 7.3 (2T) 5.94 Zen 5 can generally pull these optimizations off at 8 per cycle, but not for a single thread. It would be rare for code to zero so many registers or move a lot of values between registers in close proximity, so those renamer restrictions may have let AMD simplify this stage. Two SMT threads will of course have independent instructions, and Zen 5 maintains the ability to blast through that quickly should both threads happen to hit a sequence of zeroing idioms or register-to-register MOVs at the same time. Giant Backend, Unified Schedulers CPUs use various structures in the backend to let them execute instructions as data becomes available for them while ensuring results are consistent with in-order execution. AMD’s Zen line was often light on these resources compared to contemporary Intel cores, and couldn’t look as far ahead in the instruction stream to hide latency. A lower latency cache hierarchy helped keep AMD’s performance competitive. Zen 5 continues to have smaller structures compared to Intel, but significantly closes that gap in some areas. Its reorder buffer, FP register file, and load queue sizes are quite close to Golden Cove’s. The integer register file sees less of a size increase, possibly because it’s hard to feed 6 ALU and 4 AGU ports while adding a ton of register file entries. And while AMD’s store queue has grown substantially, entries are still 256 bits. 512-bit stores will take two entries just as with Zen 4.Applies if instruction… Zen 5 (Strix Point) Zen 4 Intel Redwood Cove Reorder Buffer Exists 448 entry 320 entry 512 entry Integer Register File Writes to integer registers 240 entry 224 entry 288 entry FP Register File Writes to FP registers 384 entry Of which ~234 are available for reordering 512-bit ops 192x 512-bit entry 320x 256-bit Some may physically be 512-bit but that’s impossible to verify Mask Register File Writes to AVX-512 mask registers ~146 entry 68 entry 144 entry Tested via MMX, which has been aliased to the mask RF in the past Load Queue Reads from memory 202 entry 136 entry 240 entry Store Queue Writes to memory 104x 256-bit 64 entry 112 entry AMD also made compromises with the FP/vector register file. Testing shows about 234 entries are available for in-flight instructions that write to 512-bit ZMM registers. Zen 5 is not allocating pairs of 256-bit registers to handle a 512-bit operation. AMD’s slides clearly indicate the vector register file has 384 entries, but 234 * 2 would be 468 physical 256-bit registers. Mixing a ZMM write reduces reordering capacity for 256-bit YMM registers by exactly one, implying only a single register was allocated to hold that 512-bit result. However, testing by Mystical shows that all vector register file entries on desktop Zen 5 are 512-bits wide. 379 in-flight YMM writes with one ZMM write also in flight, 380 without the ZMM. Spikes earlier might indicate Zen 5 has trouble perfectly reclaiming registers when in-flight instructions use both ZMM and YMM registers Zen 5’s rename/allocate stage sometimes handles register allocation poorly. Alternating between writing to ZMM and YMM registers should not reduce reordering capacity for FP/vector results, because more than half of Zen 5’s register file entries are 512 bits wide. Intel’s Golden Cove does exactly that, but Zen 5 stops at 288 registers (144 of each). That’s still more register file capacity allocated than what a hypothetical fully 256-bit register file would have, but it does point to less than optimal allocation. With Zen 4, AMD used a fully 512-bit vector register file because using wider entries only had a minor area hit compared to increasing register file port count or width. A 512-bit register file with twice as many entries as Zen 4’s might have been impractical for a mobile core. Splitting vector registers into two pools feels like a good compromise, especially considering Zen 5 still has more 512-bit register file entries than Zen 4 had in total. FP/Vector Execution Across Zen generations, AMD has slowly moved towards a more distributed FP scheduler layout. AMD is adding new scheduling queues while cutting down on port count per queue, but without significantly changing entry count. In Zen tradition, the rename/allocate stage can dump FP/vector ops into a huge non-scheduling queue if the schedulers are full rather than stalling. This queue is even larger now, with 96 entries instead of 64 as in prior generations. 64 entries was already a lot, and Zen 2 would often run out of FP register file entries before filling the schedulers and non-scheduling queue. Zen 5’s giant register file should make things more balanced. Zen 5’s floating point execution unit layout is immediately recognizable as something from the Zen family. FP math operations use four ports, two of which do floating point multiplies and fused multiply adds (FMAs). The other two handle floating point adds. FP adds and multiplies have 3 cycle latency, while FMAs have 4 cycle latency. All of the FP math units are 256-bits wide, as with Zen 2. AMD is focused on feeding its existing execution units rather than having bigger ones. Vector integer execution sees changes that are probably geared towards keeping power and area under control. Vector integer addition latency goes up to two cycles, compared to one cycle on Zen 4. Execution rate for 128-bit SSE and 256-bit AVX2 packed integer adds has gone from four per cycle down to two per cycle. Vector integer throughput is still the same at 1024 bits per cycle, but programs will need to use AVX-512 to get there. Having fewer, wider vector integer ports may cut down on power because fewer operations are sent from the schedulers and fewer distinct register file reads happen for the same number of compute operations. But prior Zen generations are just a bit more nimble in that regard. Integer Execution Scalar integer execution goes in the opposite direction. Zen 5 has one big unified 88 entry scheduler, capable of selecting six operations per cycle to feed the core’s six integer execution ports. It reminds me of big unified schedulers from Intel’s Core line. Meteor Lake’s Redwood Cove uses a 96 entry scheduler to feed six integer execution ports. Zen 5 uses separate ports and schedulers for its vector/FP units, but the size and port count of both schedulers is quite similar. Prior Zen generations and Intel’s E-Core line use a more distributed scheduling scheme. Using separate schedulers means each scheduler doesn’t have to select as many operations per cycle. But that often makes schedulers more specific to certain operations, which increases the risk of filling up one scheduling queue and causing the renamer to stall, even if scheduling entries are available in other queues. Using a unified scheduler also makes it possible to assign operations to execution ports right before they’re issued to those execution units, rather than at the renamer. That can provide additional flexibility, avoiding corner cases where several ops in one scheduler become ready, but all of them experience contention for that scheduler’s port. A unified scheduler doesn’t necessarily mean port selection happens right as micro-ops become ready, but AMD did talk about that in an interview so Zen 5 likely does this. Address Generation Memory operations get their addresses generated by four address generation units (AGUs), which are fed by a unified 58 entry scheduler. Zen 4 could technically give more scheduler capacity to memory operations, but those entries had to be shared by integer math operations. Zen 5 is therefore a bit like Zen 2, with a unified AGU scheduler separate from the integer units. Of course, Zen 5’s AGU scheduler has about twice as much capacity as Zen 2’s, and feeds four ports instead of three. The four AGUs let Zen 5 sustain four scalar integer memory accesses per cycle. All four can be loads, and up to two can be stores. Memory Dependencies and Alignment After calculating addresses, the load/store unit has to ensure memory operations appear to execute in the correct order. If a program loads data from a memory address that it wrote to soon before, the load might have to get its data from an in-flight store rather than the cache hierarchy. Like prior Zen CPUs, Zen 5 can do fast store forwarding as long as the load is contained within the prior store. The most common and trivial case of an exact address match is handled with zero latency, carrying forward a feature introduced with Zen 3. Because Zen 5 has four AGUs, it can do zero latency forwarding for two dependent load-store pairs. Zen 3 and Zen 4 could only do so for one pair at a time. Intel’s Golden Cove has similar behavior for the exact address match case, but can’t do zero latency forwarding if both the load and store cross a 64B boundary. Store to load forwarding results using Henry Wong’s methodology Cases where the load is contained within the store are handled with 7 cycle latency. Zen 4 was a bit faster because it could occasionally do that with 6 cycle latency. Intel’s Golden Cove could do that with 5 cycle latency, but fares worse if fast store forwarding fails due to a partial overlap. Golden Cove suffers a 19-20 cycle penalty in that case, higher than Zen 4’s 18 cycle penalty and much higher than Zen 5’s 14 cycle penalty. And results from Zen 4 Looking at independent loads and stores shows that Zen 5’s data cache has 64 byte alignment for both loads and stores. That reduces throughput losses from misaligned stores. AMD used 32 byte store alignment for Zen 2 through Zen 4, and 16 byte store alignment on Zen 1. All Zen generations have 64 byte load alignment. The penalty for a misaligned store has gone down too, with Zen 5 able to handle a misaligned store every cycle. Maybe Zen 5’s data cache has two write ports. Address Translation Programs use virtual addresses, which have to be translated on-the-fly to addresses in physical memory. CPUs speed this up by caching recently used translations in TLBs, or translation lookaside buffers. Zen 5 increases TLB sizes to reduce address translation delays. AMD uses separate TLB hierarchies for instruction and data. Zen 5’s instruction side sees its L2 TLB quadruple in size, while the data side gets 33% TLB capacity increases on both levels.Zen 5 Zen 4 Intel Redwood Cove Instruction TLB L1: 64 entry fully associative L2: 2048 entry L1: 64 entry fully associative L2: 512 entry L1: 128 entry 8-way L2: Shared with L2 Data TLB L1 Data TLB 96 entry fully associative 72 entry fully associative Loads: 96 entry 6-way Stores: 16 entry fully associative L2 Data TLB 4096 entry 3072 entry 24-way 2048 entry 8-way Shared with instruction accesses Getting a translation from Zen 5’s L2 DTLB costs 7 extra cycles, the same as on Zen 4. AMD has therefore managed a substantial L2 TLB size increase with no latency penalty. Intel has a smaller L2 TLB, which is also shared with instruction accesses. Redwood Cove’s L2 TLB latency is also 7 cycles. Intel’s caching capacity for address translations comes up short compared to AMD’s, which can increase memory access latency seen by software. Cache and Memory Access Good caching is vital to performance. Zen 5 uses a familiar triple level cache hierarchy, but AMD has made the L1 data cache bigger. Even though the L1D grows from 32 to 48 KB, latency remains at 4 cycles. Load bandwidth for Strix Point remains the same at 64 bytes per cycle as Zen 4, but the store bandwidth has increased to 64 bytes per cycle so that Strix can deal with 1 512b store per cycle. AMD has thus increased per-cycle L1D bandwidth for the first time since Zen 2. Bandwidth increases continue to Zen 5’s L2 cache, which has 64 byte per cycle read and write paths. Exercising both paths with a read-modify-write pattern achieves about 85 bytes per cycle with L2-sized arrays. While not quite 128 bytes per cycle, it’s comfortably above the 64 bytes per cycle that Zen 4 is limited to. From L3, a single core can achieve 32 bytes per cycle with only reads or only writes, or 64 bytes per cycle with an even mix of both. L3 bandwidth in this case is capped by the core’s 32 byte per cycle interface to the intra-CCX interconnect. It’s a bit better than Zen 4, which couldn’t quite hit 32 bytes per cycle from L3 with a single core active. With all cores in play, Zen 5’s mild hybrid setup gives it a cache bandwidth edge over Intel’s Meteor Lake. Even though Meteor Lake has 16 cores to Strix Point’s 12, all eight of Strix Point’s area optimized cores use the same architecture as their high performance counterparts and have the same 64 bytes per cycle of load bandwidth. Meteor Lake’s Crestmont efficiency cores can only load 32 bytes per cycle from their data caches. The gap widens at lower cache levels, where Intel has four E-Cores share a L2 instance with 64 bytes per cycle of bandwidth. DRAM bandwidth is similar, with Intel’s Core Ultra 7 155H getting 83 GB/s to Strix Point’s 79.9 GB/s. It’s not a big difference, and both chips enjoy plenty of bandwidth from their LPDDR5 setups. Latency Zen 5’s cache latency characteristics don’t change much compared to Zen 4, which is great because Zen 4 generally does well in that regard. The Zen 5 cluster takes 2-3 extra cycles to access its larger 16 MB L3 cache, but it’s a very minor difference and well worth the extra capacity the cache provides. AMD’s work on the L2 is appreciated too, as they’ve managed to keep latency at 14 cycles despite increasing associativity from 8-way to 16-way. Actual latency is of course much better on the high performance Zen 5 cluster thanks to higher clock speeds. Against Intel’s Redwood Cove, Zen 5 enjoys better latency at every level in the memory hierarchy. Sometimes though, Intel can have an advantage because Meteor Lake gives its P-Cores access to more cache capacity. Intel’s L2 is larger of course, at 2 MB versus 1 MB on AMD. And Meteor Lake can give one core access to 24 MB of L3 capacity while Strix Point splits its 24 MB of L3 into separate instances. DRAM latency is around 128 ns on the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. It’s better than Intel’s Core Ultra 7 155H, which sees 148 ns of memory latency. Even though both chips use a similar LPDDR5 configuration at first glance and achieve similar bandwidth figures, AMD somehow gets better latency. However, even AMD’s LPDDR5 controller suffers much higher latency than DDR5. The 7950X3D with DDR5-5600 for example has well under 100 ns of DRAM latency. Some Light Benchmarking Detailed performance benchmarking is best left to mainstream tech outlets, which have more time and resources. Still, it’s interesting to look at how Zen 5 stacks up against Intel’s current Meteor Lake architecture. I’m testing Meteor Lake in my Asus Zenbook 14 OLED. I’ve also run the video encoding test on my Ryzen 7950X3D desktop, locked to the non-VCache die and with clock speeds capped to 5.15 GHz. Affinity set to four highest performance cores on the mobile platforms Even with the same core count and maximum clock frequency, desktop Zen 4 comfortably pulls ahead of mobile Zen 5. In a desktop platform, a Zen 4 core has access to twice as much L3 cache and lower latency DDR5. That goes to show how important the memory subsystem is. Against Intel, Strix Point comfortably smashes Meteor Lake in a matched core count test. AMD’s AVX-512 support is a factor in this test. Without AVX-512 support, Intel has to execute about 10% more instructions to complete the workload. Intel can’t clock as high as AMD can either. Therefore, Redwood Cove falls behind even though it’s averaging more instructions per cycle. Seeing AMD take the lead with AVX-512 being a factor is weird. Intel released the first AVX-512 capable CPUs on the market, and AMD’s AVX-512 implementation still feels conservative. AMD has invested a lot of core area into their branch predictor since Zen 2, and it has paid off in the past. Zen 5 keeps pushing on that area, but might be running into diminishing returns. Zen 5’s branch predictor may be more accurate, but in this workload the difference is so small it’s within margin of error. More capable branch predictors run into diminishing returns. Final Words Zen 5 makes sweeping changes throughout the pipeline. The core gets wider, boasts more reordering capacity, and improves caching capacity within the core without taking a latency hit. That’s not just for data. Zen 5 can cache more address translations in its TLBs, and more branch targets in its BTBs. Latency has even gone down in some cases. Being able to deal with 1024 branches in flight with effectively 0.5 cycle latency is an impressive achievement. A lower penalty for failed store forwarding suggests AMD was able to cut down pipeline length between address calculation and store retirement, since that’s a straightforward way to fall back when fast store forwarding fails. Considering other significant changes like a clustered frontend, different scheduler layout, more execution units, and extra cache bandwidth makes me feel like Zen 5 involved a lot of engineering effort. It’s a refreshing contrast compared to Intel Meteor Lake’s Redwood Cove and Crestmont, which made very minor changes over Raptor Lake and Alder Lake’s respective P and E cores. Another contrast with Intel is AMD’s focus on SMT. Intel has indicated a shift away from SMT, at least for mobile products like their upcoming Lunar Lake. Implementing SMT by itself doesn’t cost a lot of area or power. But optimizing a core for SMT can involve increasing core structure sizes to ensure each thread gets a healthy amount of entries when two SMT threads are active. Intel decided their hybrid strategy could deliver high multithreaded performance without having to chase diminishing returns further than they wanted to for a single thread. AMD takes the opposite approach. Zen 5 seems to be designed with a strong focus on SMT. Certain parts of the core like the renamer and decoders need two threads active to achieve their full potential. AMD still emphasizes single threaded performance of course, but they’re chasing multithreaded performance with a combination of density optimized physical implementations and SMT, rather than different core architectures. That strategy does come with some advantages, like keeping AVX-512 enabled across the company’s CPU lineup. Maybe AMD is wise to twist the knife while Intel inexplicably refuses to add AVX-512 support to its E-Core line. These contrasting approaches show there’s often no clear right or wrong choice when it comes to CPU architecture. Intel and AMD both have a lot of smart engineers. Both have gone in different directions when choosing between unified and distributed schedulers, whether to prioritize SMT, or how to create a hybrid core setup. Those decisions change even within the same company. AMD went from a 256-bit vector register file, to a fully 512-bit one, and then to a lopsided one with both 256-bit and 512-bit entries. Another choice is how to balance performance per clock gains against clock speed. Zen 5 de-prioritizes the latter, since Strix Point barely clocks higher than Phoenix. Therefore Zen 5’s performance gains are lower compared to prior Zen generations due to a lack of an increase in clock speed, even though the headline IPC gain is in-line with what those prior generations offered. Hopefully Zen 5 sets a solid foundation for AMD to build future CPUs off.

People want the option to make their laptop silent or nearly silent. And when users do need the power, they generally prefer a slightly slower laptop at a reasonable volume rather than the roar of a jet engine. Laptop manufacturers want their devices to score high on benchmarks. The best way to do that is to add a fan that can become very loud. The incentives are not aligned. All laptops should be designed to operate passively 100% of the time, if the owner so chooses. I doubt manufacturers will go that route unless Microsoft nudges them towards it. It would have downstream effects on how review sites benchmark laptops (i.e., at various power draws/noise levels producing a curve rather than a single number), which would have downstream effects on what CPU designers optimize for. It'd be great for consumers. reply jwells89 2 hours agoparentIt might also be good to mandate 10+ hours of battery life when the laptop is in power saving mode. A number of laptops that'd otherwise have decent battery life are hampered by things like half-baked power management of discrete GPUs that doesn't completely cut power supply to those components. Manufacturers should be more heavily testing under this mode. reply mqus 4 hours agoparentprev> add support for a \"max fan speed\" slider somewhere prominent in the Windows UI. Isn't that what the \"power settings\" do? It's a slider at the bottom right, hidden in a tray icon. Sure, it only has three positions and also influences battery consumption but it pretty much does what you want. (Not sure if windows 11 kept this though) reply kevin_thibedeau 15 hours agoparentprevStop demanding paper thin laptops. My work Dell rarely turns on its fan unless an AV scan is in progress and even then it's rather tolerable.

You might want something else. reply rafaelmn 15 hours agorootparentprevMacBook Air is thin and fanless, so it can be done. reply AnthonyMouse 8 hours agorootparent\"Thin and fanless\" aren't that hard, just use any low power CPU. But then people also want fast. Apple does this by buying out TSMC's capacity for the latest process nodes and then taking the performance/efficiency trade off in favor of efficiency, so they get something with similar performance and lower power consumption. But then they charge you $400 for $50 worth of RAM and solder it so you can't upgrade it yourself. The thing to realize is that fans are not required to spin, and the difference between the faster and slower processors are the clock speed rather than the transistors. So what you want is exactly what the OP requested: A laptop with fans in it, but you can turn them off. Then the CPU gets capped at a 15W TDP, has basically the same single-thread performance but is slower on threaded workloads, and it's no longer possible for Chrome to make your laptop loud. But if you want to open up Blender you still have the option to move up the fan slider and make it go faster. reply ThatMedicIsASpy 51 minutes agorootparentDon't run Windows and you don't need fast.

Zen5 CCD is pretty much the same size as Zen4 (though with 27% more transistors), so core size should be similar. AMD has also stated that Zen5c has a similar shrink percent to Zen4c. We'll use their numbers. HX370 has 4P+8C for a total area of 35.2mm2. If being twice the size despite being on N4P instead of N5 like M1 seems like foreshadowing, it is. We'll use notebookcheck's Cinebench 2024 multithread power and performance numbers to calculate perf / power / area then multiply that by 100 to eliminate some decimals. M1 Pro scores 824 (10-core) and while they don't have a power value listed, they do list 33.6w package power running the prime95 power virus, so cinebench's power should be lower than that. HX370 scored 1213 (12-core) and averaged 119w (maxing at a massive 121.7w and that's without running a power virus).

Getting 32% higher performance from 17% more cores implies higher performance per core. The power measurements that site uses are from the plug, which is highly variable to the point of uselessness because it takes into account every other component the OEM puts into the machine and random other factors like screen brightness, thermal solution and temperature targets (which affects fan speed which affects fan power consumption) etc. If you measure the wall power of a system with a discrete GPU that by itself has a TDP >100W and the system is drawing >100W, this tells you nothing about the efficiency of the CPU. AMD's CPUs have internal power monitors and configurable power targets. At full load there is very little light between the configured TDP and what they actually use. This is basically required because the CPU has to be able to operate in a system that can't dissipate more heat than that, or one that can't supply more power. > Meanwhile, if AMD used the same 33w, nobody would buy their chips because performance would be so incredibly bad. 33W is approximately what their mobile CPUs actually use. Also, even lower-configured TDP models exist and they're not that much slower, e.g. the 7840U has a base TDP of 15W vs. 35W for the 7840HS and the difference is a base clock of 3.3GHz instead of 3.8GHz. reply hajile 3 hours agorootparent> Getting 32% higher performance from 17% more cores implies higher performance per core.

What on that motherboard would be using the remaining 85+W of power? TDP is a suggestion, not a hard limit. Before thermal throttling, they will often exceed the TDP by a factor of 2x or more. As to these specific benchmarks, the R9 7945HX3D you linked to used 187w while the M2 Max used 78w for CB R15.

The argument isn’t that Apple is unique, it’s that the performance gaps they’ve shown are more than simply buying premium fab capacity. That doesn’t mean other designers can’t also do that work, but simply that it’s more than just the process - for example, the M2 shipped on TSMC’s N5P first as an exclusive but when Zen 5 shipped later on the same process it didn’t close the single core performance or perf/watt gap. Some of that is x86 vs. ARM but there isn’t a single, simple factor which can explain this - e.g. Apple carefully tuning the hardware, firmware, OS, compilers, and libraries too undoubtably helps a lot and it’s been a perennial problem for non-Intel vendors on the PC side since so many developers have tuned for Intel first/only for decades. reply AnthonyMouse 6 hours agorootparent> for example, the M2 shipped on TSMC’s N5P first as an exclusive but when Zen 5 shipped later on the same process it didn’t close the single core performance or perf/watt gap.

Pretty sure it won't happen though; it'd be a rather difficult political mess of more and more \"please add special-casing of my hardware\", and would have the problem of it ceasing to reasonably function on hardware released after being compiled (unless like glibc or something gets some standard set of hardware performance properties that can be updated independently of precompiled software, which'd be extra hard to get through).

Over masks it has the benefit of allowing simple hardware short-circuiting, though I'd imagine it'd be cheap enough to 'or' together mask bit groups to short-circuit on (and would also have the benefit of better masked throughput) Cray-1 (1976) had VL, though, granted, that's a pretty long span of no-VL until RVV. reply janwas 11 hours agorootparentWas thinking of a shorter avl producing partial results merged into another reg. Something like a += b; a[0] += c[0]. Without avl we'd just have a write-after-write, but with it, we now have an additional input, and whether this happens depends on global state (VL).

The agnosticness flags can be forwarded at decode-time (at the cost of the non-immediate-vtype vsetvl being very slow), so for most purposes it could be as fast as if it were a bit inside the vector instruction itself. Doesn't help vl=0 though. reply camel-cdr 9 hours agorootparentprev> Agree agnostic would help, but the machine also has to handle SW asking for mask/tail unchanged, right? Yes, but it should rarely do so. The problem is that because of the vl=0 case you always have a dependency on avl. I think the motivavtion for the vl=0 case was that any serious ooo implementation will need to predict vl/vtype anyways, so there might as well be this nice to have feature. IMO they should've only supported ta,mu. I think the only usecase for ma, is when you need to avoid exceptions. And while tu is usefull, e.g. summing am array, it could be handled differently. E.g. once vl Not sure what you mean by \"peephole heuristic optimizations\" Post-emit or within-emit stage optimization where a sequence of instructions is replaced with a more efficient shorter variant. Think replacing pairs of ldr and str with ldp and stp, changing ldr and increment with ldr with post-index addressing mode, replacing address calculation before atomic load with atomic load with addressing mode (I think it was in ARMv8.3-a?). The \"heuristic\" here might be possibly related to additional analysis when doing such optimizations. For example, previously mentioned ldr, ldr -> ldp (or stp) optimization is not always a win. During work on .NET 9, there was a change[0] that improved load and store reordering to make it more likely that simple consecutive loads and stores are merged on ARM64. However, this change caused regressions in various hot paths because, for example, previously matched ldr w0, [addr], ldr w1, [addr+4] -> modify w0 -> str w0, [addr] pair got replaced with ldp w0, w1, [add] -> modify w0, str w0 [addr]. Turns out this kind of merging defeated store forwarding on Firestorm (and newer) as well as other ARM cores. The regression was subsequently fixed[1], but I think the parent comment author may have had scenarios like these in mind.

Why would you WANT to hit 5+GHz when the downsides of exponential power take over? High clocks aren't a feature -- they are a cope. AMD/Intel maintain I-cache and maintain a uop cache kept in sync. Using a tiny part to pre-decode is different from a massive uop cache working as far in advance as possible in the hopes that your loops will keep you busy enough that your tiny 4-wide decoder doesn't become overwhelmed. 2. The float workload was always BS because you can't run nothing but floats. The integer workload had 22.1w total core power and 4.8w power for the decoder. 4.8/22.1 is 21.7%. Even the 1.8w float case is 8% of total core power. The only other argument would be that the study is wrong and 4.8w isn't actually just decoder power. 3. We're talking about worst cases here. Nothing stops ARM cores from creating a \"work pool\" of upcoming branches in priority order for them to decode if they run out of stuff on the main branch. This is the best of both worlds where you can be faster on the main branch AND still do the same branchy code trick too. 4. This is the tail wagging the dog (and something else if your numbers are correct). Complex x86 instructions have garbage performance, so they are avoided by the compiler. The problem is that you can't GUARANTEE those instructions will NEVER be used, so the mere specter of them forces complex algorithms all over the place where ARM can do more simple things. In any case, your numbers raise a VERY interesting question about x86 being RISC under the hood. Consider this. Say that we have 1024 bytes of ARM code (256 instructions). x86 is around 15% smaller (871.25 bytes) and with the longer 4.25 byte instruction average, x86 should have around 205 instructions. If ARM is generating 19.3% more uops than instructions, we have about 305 uops. x86 with just 4.7% more has 215 uops (the difference here is way outside any margins of error here). If both are doing the same work, x86 uops must be in the range of 30% more complex. Given the limits of what an ALU can accomplish, we can say with certainty that x86 uops are doing SOMETHING that isn't the RISC they claim to be doing. Perhaps one could claim that x86 is doing some more sophisticated instructions in hardware, but that's a claim that would need to be substantiated (I don't know what ISA instructions you have that give a 15% advantage being done in hardware, but aren't already in the ARM ISA and I don't see ARM refusing to add circuitry for current instructions to the ALU if it could reduce uops by 15% either). 8. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization The final optimization stage is basically heuristic find & replace. There could in theory be a mathematically provable \"best instruction selection\", but finding it would require trying every possible combination which isn't possible as long as P=NP holds true. My favorite absurdity of x86 (though hardly the only one) is padding. You want to align function calls at cacheline boundaries, but that means padding the previous cache line with NOPs. Those NOPs translate into uops though. Instead, you take your basic, short instruction and pad it with useless bytes. Add a couple useless bytes to a bunch of instructions and you now have the right length to push the function over to the cache boundary without adding any NOPs. But the issues go deeper. When do you use a REX prefix? You may want it so you can use 16 registers, but it also increases code size. REX2 with APX is going to increase this issue further where you must juggle when to use 8, 16, or 32 registers and when you should prefer the long REX2 because it has 3-register instructions. All kinds of weird tradeoffs exist throughout the system. Because the compilers optimize for the CPU and the CPU optimizes for the compiler, you can wind up in very weird places. In an ISA like ARM, there isn't any code density weirdness to consider. In fact, there's very little weirdness at all. Write it the intuitive way and you're pretty much guaranteed to get good performance. Total time to work on the compiler is a zero-sum game given the limited number of experts. If you have to deal with these kinds of heuristic headaches, there's something else you can't be working on. reply dzaima 13 hours agorootparent> My favorite absurdity of x86 (though hardly the only one) is padding.

I'd call that more neat than absurd. > You may want it so you can use 16 registers, but it also increases code size. RISC-V has the exact same issue, some compressed instructions having only 3 bits for operand registers. And on x86 for 64-bit-operand instructions you need the REX prefix always anyways. And it's not that hard to pretty reasonably solve - just assign registers by their use count. Peephole optimizations specifically here are basically irrelevant. Much of the complexity for x86 comes from just register allocation around destructive operations (though, that said, that does have rather wide-ranging implications). Other than that, there's really not much difference; all have the same general problems of moving instructions together for fusing, reordering to reduce register pressure vs putting parallelizable instructions nearer, rotating loops to reduce branches, branches vs branchless. reply hajile 6 hours agorootparentRISC-V has a different version of this issue that is pretty straight-forward. Preferring 2-register operations is already done to save register space. The only real extra is preferring the 8 registers C uses for math. After this, it's all just compression. x86 has a multitude of other factors than just compression. This is especially true with standard vs REX instructions because most of the original 8 instructions have specific purposes and instructions that depend on them for these (eg, Accumulator instructions with A register, Mul/div using A+D, shift uses C, etc). It's a problem a lot harder than simple compression. Just as cracking an alphanumeric password is exponentially harder than a same-length password with numbers only, solving for all the x86 complications and exceptions is also exponentially harder. reply dzaima 4 hours agorootparentIf anything, I'd say x86's fixed operands make register allocation easier! Don't have to register-allocate that which you can't. (ok, it might end up worse if you need some additional 'mov's. And in my experience more 'mov's is exactly what compilers often do.) And, right, RISC-V even has the problem of being two-operand for some compressed instructions. So the same register allocation code that's gone towards x86 can still help RISC-V (and vice versa)! On RISC-V, failure means 2→4 bytes on a compressed instruction, and on x86 it means +3 bytes of a 'mov'. (granted, the additioanal REX prefix cost is separate on x86, while included in decompression on RISC-V) reply hajile 3 hours agorootparentWith 16 registers, you can't just avoid a register because it has a special use. Instead, you must work to efficiently schedule around that special use. Lack of special GPRs means you can rename with impunity (this will change slightly with the load/store pair extension). Having 31 truly GPR rather than 8 GPR+8 special GPR also gives a lot of freedom to compilers. reply dzaima 3 hours agorootparentFunction arguments and return values already are effectively special use, and should frequently be on par if not much more frequent than the couple x86 instructions with fixed registers. Both clang and gcc support calls having differing used calling conventions within one function, which ends up effectively exactly identical to fixed-register instructions (i.e. an x86 'imul r64' can be done via a pseudo-function where the return values are in rdx & rax, an input is in rax, and everything else is non-volatile; and the dynamically-choosable input can be allocated separately). And '__asm__()' can do mixed fixed and non-fixed registers anyway. reply hajile 1 hour agorootparentUnlike x86, none of this is strictly necessary. As long as you put things back as expected, you may use all the registers however you like. reply dzaima 47 minutes agorootparentThe option of not needing any fixed register usage would apply to, what, optimizing compilers without support for function calls (at least via passing arguments/results via registers)? That's a very tiny niche to use as an argument for having simplified compiler behavior. And good register allocation is very pretty important on RISC-V - using more registers, besides leading to less compressed instruction usage, means more non-volatile register spilling/restoring in function prologue/epilogue, which on current compilers (esp. clang) happens at the start & end of functions, even in paths that don't need the registers. That said, yes, RISC-V still indeed has much saner baseline behavior here and allows for simpler basic register allocation, but for non-trivial compilers the actual set of useful optimizations isn't that different. reply clamchowder 13 hours agorootparentprev1. Performance. Also Arm implemented instruction cache coherency too. Predecode/uop cache are both means to the same end, mitigating decode power. AMD and Intel have used both (though not on the same core). Arm has used both, including both on the same core for quite a few generations. And a uop cache is just a cache. It's also big enough on current generations to cache more than just loops, to the point where it covers a majority of the instruction stream. Not sure where the misunderstanding of the uop cache \"working as far in advance is possible\" comes from. Unless you're talking about the BPU running ahead and prefetching into it? Which it does for L1i, and L2 as well? 2. \"you can't run nothing but floats\" they didn't do that in the paper, they did D += A[j] + B[j] ∗ C[j]. Something like matrix multiplication comes to mind, and that's not exactly a rare workload considering some ML stuff these days. But also, has a study been done on Arm cores? For all we know they could spend similar power budgets on decode, or more. I could say an Arm core uses 99% of its power budget on decode, and be just as right as you are (they probably don't, my point is you don't have concrete data on both Arm and x86 decode power, which would be necessary for a productive discussion on the subject) 3. You're describing letting the BPU run ahead, which everyone has been doing for the past 15 years or so. Losing fetch bandwidth past a taken branch is a different thing. 4. Not sure where you're going. You started by suggesting Arm has less micro-op expansion than x86, and I provided a counterexample. Now you're talking about avoiding complex instructions, which a) compilers do on both architectures, they'll avoid stuff like division, and b) humans don't in cases where complex instructions are beneficial, see Linux kernel using rep movsb (https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/5189dafa4cf950e675f02...), and Arm introducing similar complex instructions (https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architecture...) Also \"complex\" x86 instructions aren't avoided in the video encoding workload. On x86 it takes ~16.5T instructions to finish the workload, and ~19.9T on Arm (and ~23.8T micro-ops on Neoverse V2). If \"complex\" means more work per instruction, then x86 used more complex instructions, right? 8. You can use a variable length NOP on x86, or multiple NOPs on Arm to align function calls to cacheline boundaries. What's the difference? Isn't the latter worse if you need to move by more than 4 bytes, since you have multiple NOPs (and thus multiple uops, which you think is the case but isn't always true, as some x86 and some Arm CPUs can fuse NOP pairs) But seriously, do try gathering some data to see if cacheline alignment matters. A lot of x86/Arm cores that do micro-op caching don't seem to care if a function (or branch target) is aligned to the start of a cacheline. Golden Cove's return predictor does appear to track targets at cacheline granularity, but that's a special case. Earlier Intel and pretty much all AMD cores don't seem to care, nor do the Arm ones I've tested. Anyway, you're making a lot of unsubstantiated guesses on \"weirdness\" without anything to suggest it has any effect. I don't think this is the right approach. Instead of \"tail wagging the dog\" or whatever, I suggest a data-based approach where you conduct experiments on some x86/Arm CPUs, and analyze some x86/Arm programs. I guess the analogy is, tell the dog to do something and see how it behaves? Then draw conclusions off that? reply hajile 4 hours agorootparent1. The biggest chip market is laptops and getting 15% better performance for 80% more power (like we saw with X Elite recently) isn't worth doing outside the marketing win of a halo product (a big reason why almost everyone is using slower X Elite variants). The most profitable (per-chip) market is servers. They also prefer lower clocks and better perf/watt because even with the high chip costs, the energy will wind up costing them more over the chip's lifespan. There's also a real cost to adding extra pipeline stages. Tejas/Jayhawk cores are Intel's cancelled examples of this. L1 cache is \"free\" in that you can fill it with simple data moves. uop cache requires actual work to decode and store elements for use in addition to moving the data. As to working ahead, you already covered this yourself. If you have a nearly 1-to-1 instruction-to-uop ratio, having just 4 decoders (eg, zen4) is a problem because you can execute a lot more than just 4 instructions on the backend. 6-wide Zen4 means you use 50% more instructions than you decode per clock. You make up for this in loops, but that means while you're executing your current loop, you must be maxing out the decoders to speculatively fill the rest of the uop cache before the loop finishes. If the loop finishes and you don't have the next bunch of instructions decoded, you have a multi-cycle delay coming down the pipeline. 2. I'd LOVE to see a similar study of current ARM chips, but I think the answer here is pretty simple to deduce. ARM's slide says \"4x smaller decoders vs A710\" despite adding a 5th decoder. They claim 20% reduction in power at the same performance and the biggest change is the decoder. As x86 decode is absolutely more complex than aarch32, we can only deduce that switching from x86 to aarch64 would be an even more massive reduction. If we assume an identical 75% reduction in decoder power, we'd move from 4.8w on haswell the decoder down to 1.2w reducing total core power from 22.1 to 18.5 or a ~16% overall reduction in power. This isn't too far from to the power numbers claimed by ARM. 4. This was a tangent. I was talking about uops rather than the ISA. Intel claims to be simple RISC internally just like ARM, but if Intel is using nearly 30% fewer uops to do the same work, their \"RISC\" backend is way more complex than they're admitting. 8. I believe aligning functions to cacheline boundaries is a default flag at higher optimization levels. I'm pretty sure that they did the analysis before enabling this by default. x86 NOP flexibility is superior to ARM (as is its ability to avoid them entirely), but the cause is the weirdness of the x86 ISA and I think it's an overall net negative. Loads of x86 instructions are microcode only. Use one and it'll be thousands of cycles. They remain in microcode because nobody uses them, so why even try to optimize and they aren't used because they are dog slow. How would you collect data about this? Nothing will ever change unless someone pours in millions of dollars in man-hours into attempting to speed it up, but why would anyone want to do that? Optimizing for a local maxima rather than a global maxima happens all over technology and it happens exactly because of the data-driven approach you are talking about. Look for the hot code and optimize it without regard that there may be a better architecture you could be using instead. Many successes relied on an intuitive hunch. ISA history has a ton of examples. iAPX432 super-CISC, the RISC movement, branch delay slots, register windows, EPIC/VLIW, Bulldozer's CMT, or even the Mill design. All of these were attempts to find new maxima with greater or lesser degrees of success. When you look into these, pretty much NONE of them had any real data to drive them because there wasn't any data until they'd actually started work. reply anvuong 16 hours agorootparentprevThat was true when ARM was first released, but over the years the decoder for ARM has gotten more and more complicated. Who would have guessed adding more specialized instructions would result in more complicated decoders?

ARM is inherently more efficient than x86 CPUs in most tasks 2. Nuvia and Apple are better CPU designers than AMD and Intel Here are results from Notebookcheck: Cinebench R24 ST perf/watt * M3: 12.7 points/watt * X Elite: 9.3 points/watt * AMD HX 370: 3.74 points/watt * AMD 8845HS: 3.1 points/watt * Intel 155H: 3.1 points/watt In ST, Apple is 3.4x more efficient than Zen5. X Elite is 2.4x more efficient than Zen5. Cinebench R24 MT perf/watt * M3: 28.3 points/watt * X Elite: 22.6 points/watt * AMD HX 370: 19.7 points/watt * AMD 8845HS: 14.8 points/watt * Intel 155H: 14.5 points/watt In MT, Apple is 1.9x more efficient than Zen4 and 1.4x more efficient than HX 370. I expect M3 Pro/Max to increase the gap because generally, more cores means more efficiency for Cinebench MT. X Elite is also more efficient but the gap is closer. However, we should note that in a laptop, ST matters more for efficiency because of the burst behavior of usage. It's easier to gain in MT efficiency as long as you have many cores and run them at lower wattage. In this case, AMD's Zen5 12 core setup and 24 threads works well in Cinebench. Cinebench loves more threads. One thing that is intriguing is that X Elite does not have little cores which hurts its MT efficiency. It's likely a remnant of Nuvia designing a server CPU, which does not need big.Little but Qualcomm used it in a laptop SoC first.

It's not a consistent gap. > Integer workloads are by far the most common, but they tend to not scale to multiple cores very well. The HX370 does better than the Me in specint MT though. But regardless the anandtech results paint a much closer picture than the single R24 results that GP used as the basis of the efficiency thesis. reply aurareturn 32 minutes agorootparentThe HX370 should win in SPECINT MT. It has 12 cores to the M3's 8 cores and it runs at significantly higher power. Compare HX370 SPECINT MT To an M3 Pro and let's see the results. reply aurareturn 1 hour agorootparentprev>I'm not sure how you're reaching the conclusion of \"most tasks\" when Cinebench R24 is the only test you used because R23, which doesn't agree, was rejected for hand-wavey nebulous reasons, and nothing else was tested. There are no hand-wavey nebulous reasons. Cinebench R23 uses Intel Embree engine, which is hand optimized for x86 CPUs. That's why x86 CPUs look far better than ARM CPUs in it. If there is an application that is purely hand optimized for ARM, and then compiled for x86, do you think it's fair to use it to compare the two architectures? SPEC & GB6 mostly agrees with Cinebench 2024. reply trynumber9 14 hours agoparentprevThe Snapdragon X Elite is on the same node and when actually doing a lot of work (i.e. cores loaded) it is close enough to HX 370 while delivering similar throughput. Why wouldn't the inherent inefficiency of x64 be as noticeable in MT when all the inefficient cores are working? Because it is running at lower clocks? Then what allows it to match the SDXE in throughput? Does that need to lower its clock even more? I'm not seeing what makes it inherent. reply rafaelmn 14 hours agoparentprevFrom you link - Intel is topping the performance charts (alongside AMD in SC) - they probably tune power usage agressively to achieve these results. I would guess it's more to do with coming from desktop CPU design to mobile vs. phones to laptops. reply aurareturn 13 hours agorootparent>From you link - Intel is topping the performance charts (alongside AMD in SC) - they probably tune power usage agressively to achieve these results. Cinebench 2024 ST: * M3: 142 points * X Elite: 123 points * AMD HX 370: 116 points * AMD 8845HS: 102 points * Intel 155H: 108 points Amongst each company's best laptop ST SoCs, no, Intel and AMD are far behind in both ST scores and perf/watt. If you're referring to desktop speeds, then yes, Intel's 14900k does top the charts in ST Cinebench but it likely uses well over 100w. I mostly care about laptop SoCs. In the case of the M3, it doesn’t even have a fan. reply rafaelmn 13 hours agorootparentThat's what I'm thinking - they make trade-offs to reach peak performance in desktop designs that don't translate optimally to laptops and when you start from mobile designs you probably made the opposite trade-offs - that would be my guess for the discrepancy. reply hajile 4 hours agorootparentLaptops vastly outsell desktops, so this tradeoff means hurting the majority of your customers to please a small minority. Servers also care about perf/watt a LOT and they are the highest profit margin segment. Why would AMD choose a target that hurts the majority of their market unless there wasn't another good option available? reply rafaelmn 3 hours agorootparentThe architecture started in desktop space and data center/mobile was an afterthought up until Intel shitting the bed repeatedly. If they redesigned from ground up they could probably get better instructions/watt but that would look terrible if it wasn't accompanied by a perf boost over previous generation. Just like Apple doesn't seem to scale well with more power. reply aurareturn 30 minutes agorootparent> Just like Apple doesn't seem to scale well with more power. How do you know this? When has Apple ever given 400w to the M3 Max like the 14900KS can get up to? PS. An M4 running at 7w is faster in ST than a 14900KS running in 250w+. reply aurareturn 13 hours agorootparentprevI'm pretty sure that M3 Max closely matches the 14900k in ST speeds but using something like 5 - 10% of the power. reply rafaelmn 11 hours agorootparentNot sure - they had power/thermal envelope in desktop parts and no difference in performance AFAIK. reply jeswin 5 hours agoparentprevIn the same article, if you picked their R23 benchmarks the advantage vanishes in MT benchmarks; the 3nm M3 Max is actually behind 4nm Strix Point in efficiency. reply aurareturn 4 hours agorootparentCinebench R23 is hand optimized for X86. It uses Intel Embree engine underneath. That's why Cinebench R23 heavily favors x86. reply apatheticonion 18 hours agoprevAre there any mini PCs with Zen 5? reply hajile 17 hours agoparentI think there's a lot of hope for a Strix Halo mini-PC. We currently have 7840HS+6650M with two massive heatsinks just barely coming in at what you would consider a large mini-PC rather than a SFFPC. Just one chip cuts the heatsink demand in half. The cores should be faster and it moves from 28CU up to 40CU and from RDNA2 to RDNA3.5. As long as the cross-core-complex latency isn't as bad as the HX370, I think it could be a real winner for a long time as it's basically an upgraded PS5 that runs Linux/Windows. reply moffkalast 10 hours agorootparentHell I'd settle for a Z1 SBC or even mini PC. They can't seem to keep up with demand for these new chips to put them into any sort of products that don't have complete mass appeal. It's impossible to find one that's not in a handheld gaming console. I doubt they'll even make enough of the Halo to cover laptops. reply wmf 1 hour agorootparentZ1 is basically the same as 8840U which you can find. reply sliken 16 hours agoparentprev\"AMD Strix Point expected to debut in October, claims AOOSTAR\" was a new headline I've seen. Seems about right that laptops (higher margin parts) land a few months before the SFFs. I'm excited about the strix halo that has more cores, double the GPU, and double the memory badwidth (to keep the GPU fed). reply wmf 17 hours agoparentprevYou could probably put a 9700X in a MS-A1.

The last AMD laptop code name was \"Hawk Point\" - strix is a mythological bird. Who knows if AMD will keep with this naming scheme. reply nullc 19 hours agoprevSpeaking of Zen 5, are there any rumors on when 128 core turin-x will ship? reply imtringued 15 hours agoprev>Read bandwidth from a single cluster caps out at just under 62 GB/s. The memory controller has a bit more bandwidth on tap, but you’ll need to load cores from both clusters to get it. Except for DRR5-7500 it isn't just \"a bit more\" it is actually double at 120GB/s. This might pose a challenge for LLM inference, which absolutely needs the full 120GB/s. reply moffkalast 20 hours agoprev [4 more] [flagged] halJordan 20 hours agoparent [4 more] [flagged] Dylan16807 18 hours agorootparentWhat's insane? The claim that recall is spyware isn't that bad of an exaggeration, and the claim that the NPU is hype is a reasonable opinion to have. If that 7% of the die goes unused it's not a huge waste but it's not very good either. If you're not using it enough to affect your battery then you might not get much benefit, because the GPU can do the same tasks about half as fast, it's just less efficient (and it would be a lot more than half if the NPU die space was converted into GPU compute blocks). And for serious tasks it's not very powerful. There's a range where it's good, but not as big a range as people might expect. reply imtringued 15 hours agorootparentIf my speculation about block FP16 is correct, it might be possible to hit 24 to 48 teraflops on the NPU. This means it would be entirely memory bottlenecked even in prompt processing. There would basically be no application where you would run into the NPU being a limitation. What I fear though is that the NPU will be gimped with a single infinity fabric port, which would limit it to a relatively weak 62GB/s out of 120GB/s. For crazy people who want to use 128k token context, that might turn out to make it or break it, in the end. reply moffkalast 19 hours agorootparentprev [–] Whoever makes something cheap with lots of memory bandwidth and parallel compute gets my vote :) They somehow managed to put 16GB of HBM2 with a 4096 bit bus on the Radeon VII for $700, it's not like it's impossible. Or at least enough memory channels to rival Apples's M series in some meaningful way. Besides, what do you expect will the average person be able to run on these Coral tier NPUs? They won't be running Yolov9 all day and all these things can do in practice is accelerate really tiny convnets. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
