    "commentBody": "CEOs are running companies from afar even as workers return to office (bloomberg.com)363 points by petethomas 18 hours agohidepastfavorite256 comments rtpg 17 hours agoA recurring theme in so many startups I've seen inside is how the CEO in particular is extremely aloof with regards to presence. Sometimes that translates to aloofness for staff, but what more often happens is that when the CEO _does_ come in they expect other people to be there. So long as the alignment is good they don't care, but when it's not aligned, they just assume nobody is ever around and get real pissy about people showing up on time. Fortunately the \"good\" ones are able to disassociate how much of that emotion is just them being lonely vs how much of it is actual synergy-seeking or whatever. The worst cases are people who get real tyranical, on top of just like... outright not showing up to do the actual day-to-day work that they are blockers on. A proper theory of the mind can often be quite absent. My really glib take on this phenomenom is that a not-insignificant chunk of decision making for HR stuff is \"make the CEO fill the tip-top of their Maslovian pyramind\". And to a lesser extent other executives who have decided that their job is their life. Very annoying to listen to post-facto RTO arguments when you can feel the loneliness as the driving factor. Make a fun space, and make people's work schedules be loose enough to where they can actually relax in the space, and some people will show up! Or at the very least, give the CEO a fun side project to work on or something. reply brandon272 16 hours agoparent> Sometimes that translates to aloofness for staff, but what more often happens is that when the CEO _does_ come in they expect other people to be there. Anecdotally, I have seen companies that have \"oscillations\" in their WFH policy and this, in my experience, has often been the driver of it. Instead of putting trust in the process or the data, you will simply have a situation where the CEO or (especially) where a group of the top level execs are all in the office on a particular day when the office 'feels empty', which then results in a \"where is everyone\" conversation. Couple that with a sniff of an internal deadline being missed or something behind schedule and suddenly you have a perfect storm of discontent resulting in updated WFH rules and policies being hastily fired off without regard to actual performance data or previous commitments or conclusions drawn around WFH policy. > Make a fun space, and make people's work schedules be loose enough to where they can actually relax in the space, and some people will show up! Personally, I don't care about having my workplace be fun or loaded with too many amenities. But if I'm going to be in a company workplace, I do need an office with a closing door if I'm expected to be able to focus and be productive. So much of the insanity with the WFH debate is employers who think that people can be productive or enjoy their work when working in loud, open-concept office configurations. For a lot of employees the WFH vs. office debate then feels very much a \"my private, quiet home office vs. chaotic, loud office environment\" debate. reply ern 16 hours agorootparentI think the introduction of WFH during the pandemic hurt a lot of IT workers in the long-run. In the interests of “fairness” they are being ordered back to the office post-Covid even when their work processes mean they can be done perfectly well remotely, and even if they have widely geographically-distributed teams. Anecdotal, but we had a team that was split with 50% working remotely before Covid, and we saw an improvement when everyone was forced to work remotely: conversations that were being held in person were shared openly. reply nox101 16 hours agorootparentI see the opposite. Conversations that used to happen in ear reach so I'd know what was going on with various team members and be able to contribute when I knew a solution are now conversation that happen in private chat or private VC. Productivity is way down. Even more interesting, a team lead lives in another country 6 times zones away. Some times they visit the main office for 1-2 weeks. Productivity shoots through the roof those weeks. reply bart_spoon 5 hours agorootparentThat doesn’t seem like a sustainable alternative. In the case you are describing, the productivity boost is highly dependent on actually having the right people within ear reach. You are relying on the right people happening to hear other conversations. What if your team is large, so that even if you are all in office, the chances of stumbling into the right conversation is lower? What if you are grabbing lunch, or in the bathroom, or meeting with someone else when that conversation is happening? The most effective solution in my experience has been when working remote, and having a culture where a team has open discussions on their own Slack channel, with threads for particular conversations. That way, everyone can contribute to the conversation, it’s asynchronous so you don’t have to be in exactly the right place and right time to participate, and people can go back and review details very easily if needed. You are right that that doesn’t apply if the conversations are happening in private DMs, but that’s a matter of team culture. You have to be intentional in a remote setting, just the same as you do in an office setting. But if you are it can work very well in my experience, perhaps even better than in person. reply ok_dad 15 hours agorootparentprevWell yea, when I go on a work trip I tend to work a lot more those weeks because I’m not home. That doesn’t mean productivity during those two weeks are representative of normal. reply DAGdug 14 hours agorootparentIt’s the local team, not the traveling team lead, that’s being spoken of here. reply hnlmorg 12 hours agorootparentIt’s the same root cause. If there are foreign workers in town for a week then the whole team will often work around the visitors schedule. reply Olreich 8 hours agorootparentprevSounds like you need a group chat that people are willing to talk in. If that isn’t happening, then there’s a barrier to doing it that you need to resolve. Could be they’re fine with you listening in, but not the manager. Could be something else. Fix that, and get back to productive remotely. reply consteval 4 hours agorootparentprev> Conversations that used to happen in ear reach Sorry, is this a real thing? I've never experienced this. We all have cubes and sure, maybe sometimes I can hear someone kind of close to me. But not very often. And typically, people actually speak in a low voice as to not disturb others. We have many floors in the office too, so all our meetings are on Teams. I can't remember the last time I went to a conference room. I actually really enjoy the async nature of chats. Because you can come and go in the conversation, and you don't have to grind everything you're doing to a halt. Plus, I can go back later and refresh my memory. reply munksbeer 7 hours agorootparentprevThat's a shame. We're a mostly remote workplace with very high productivity. Hopefully you can figure out how to make it work, or move to a place that suits you better. reply teractiveodular 16 hours agorootparentprevI think the real pain comes from many managers discovering that if they're going to have remote workers, might as well go whole hog and hire them in Bangalore for 1/10th the price instead of paying SV salaries. reply ok_dad 14 hours agorootparentThat’ll cause real pain for the management. Unless you pay near western market rates, you’re getting the bottom of the barrel in India or anywhere else, much like if you tried to hire US developers for even 50% of the market rate. The low priced contractors do such poor work it’s almost not useful. reply orwin 11 hours agorootparentOr they'll get hired, get taught really basic shit (chmod/chown) on the job, get a cisco/AWS certificate then leave 6 month later to join a better paying job. reply jrs235 10 hours agorootparentBut not before misapplying chmod/chown settings in your environment. reply orwin 6 hours agorootparentIn my first job we loaned Hadoop clusters that we either managed ourselves or let the client manage the IT. One of our client decided to use a contractor instead (I might miss details, it was almost 10 year ago) . The day after configuring the cluster and giving him the metaphorical keys, we saw low-level alert on one computer in that cluster, some monitoring daemon couldn't be reached but nothing really concerning (could still be pinged, no issues with the virtualisation). We still tried to look at it, but could't ssh on the computer (which explains why our daemons couldn't be reached). We contacted the client, said basically: 'we can remove the monitoring and our access keys if you want, but please tell us before you do this. Do you want it done on the other computers?'. He came back the day after that saying basically 'what?' then talking about a shard that couldn't be reached (he was nice about it). Turns out, 'chmod 777 /' is the dumbest way of breaking your workstation I've ever seen. We all hear about 'rm -rf /' but let's be real, no one has ever done it, not outside of school at least. Chmod 777 / because you couldn't manage to understand a Java stacktrace has 100% been done in a professional environment: I had to fix it. Luckily you can copy the permissions of filesystem A onto filesystem B (can't remember how, but it was easy) so the fix didn't involve any reinstallation and Hadoop wizardry. reply teractiveodular 9 hours agorootparentprevFor the next manager, perhaps, but the first guy gets a promotion for cost cutting and leaves for greener pastures before the shit hits the fan. reply triceratops 4 hours agorootparentprevFrom what I've heard, you aren't getting anywhere near the same quality in Bangalore for 1/10th the price these days. Maybe 1/3rd and that gap is shrinking. At that price you might as well hire in Western Europe and have better timezone overlaps. reply closeparen 25 minutes agorootparentprevSilicon Valley compensation in India and LatAm is broadly in line with US median for all software developers ($120k ish). It's not dramatically cheaper in absolute terms than the US low/medium cost of living markets. The idea is that it gets you the best of the best in India, vs. middle of the road in the US. reply diogenescynic 3 hours agorootparentprevHave you ever dealt with outsourced workers? They might cost 1/10th the price, but they will provide 1/20th the value. Every single time I deal with teams in India it's all about quantity, not quality. Some businesses might be fine with that, but for many it will destroy your business. reply steveBK123 7 hours agorootparentprevReally depends on your org structure. If you already had a global org, then it was already running poorly due to bad VC hardware and inability to book conference leading to lots of drive-by chats. Great for the office which has >40% of the staff in it, bad for the 3 other offices with 20%. Hybrid/remote/zoom leveled the playing field so that our non-primary-HQ devs were able to fully contribute whereas in many cases they were bodies in seat for follow-the-sun coverage who would do rote Jiras assigned to them. reply borplk 15 hours agorootparentprevYes and some people don't appreciate that some jobs really do require quiet focus for extended periods of time. Asking someone to be a programmer in a loud chaotic open office environment is not dissimilar to asking them to program while juggling two balls and sitting on a unicycle. Its just excess difficulty that doesn't need to be added on top of the jobs. reply eltoxo 7 hours agorootparentI just always assumed an \"open office\", really meaning a non-office, an empty building, was what was available for startups after the dot com bust in SF. Then after the fact we made up a bunch of bullshit as to why this is some brilliant idea. Then this idea spread as if it was some kind of technological advancement because it worked for small tech companies trying to not spend money on furniture and walls. We just aren't very good at any of this at scale. The open \"office\" and battle against remote work are different flavors of the same type of stupidity. reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 2 hours agorootparentNah it's because walls cost money and take up space. Open plan is cheaper with the trade-off that nobody likes it reply bryanrasmussen 11 hours agorootparentprevI actually like that environment, unless I'm having problems debugging something. If something is not working after an hour or so I am on edge and need peace and quiet, but otherwise I can program fine for most tasks with noise around me. reply tayo42 14 hours agorootparentprevin hindsight its amazing anything actually ever got done reply steveBK123 7 hours agorootparentMy team is very small remote-primary, but we will travel to each others cities / offices quarterly or so. We have long since given up on getting any work done on our in-office days, but see them as collaborative / bonding / light planning only. It's gotten to the point that even if we fly to each others city for a week, we might only go to the office 2~3 days, or by Wednesday/Thursday we might by physically collocated but go to different rooms in silence with headphones to actually get work done. As a dev these days are actually pretty stressful as they have the feeling of creating work faster than doing any of it. It makes me remember how unproductive my dev teams used to be with the constant in-office interruptions. At prior jobs, I used to do most of my actual dev work after hours, and on unilaterally declared WFH days reply sbrother 14 hours agorootparentprevRealistically the actual work got done in the evening after going home. reply hughesjj 11 hours agorootparentHell this is still the case for high meeting days reply whiterknight 16 hours agorootparentprev> a group of the top level execs are all in the office on a particular day when the office 'feels empty' > internal deadline being missed What indicators would justify a change in WFH policy? reply BobaFloutist 3 hours agorootparentI think they were talking about internal deadlines being missed at about baseline levels, but the timing coincides with when the execs happen to feel like the office is empty so they make a mental association. A measurable increase in missed deadlines is not what I think they meant. reply brandon272 16 hours agorootparentprevNo worthwhile indicators, other than the gut feelings of the decision makers in that moment. reply rtpg 16 hours agorootparentprevyeah, I meant \"fun\" perhaps in a more open sense of \"people are not just annoyed at everything all the time\", perhaps \"relaxed\" is the right word. I am not a superfan of actual closet office given, like, CO2 and friends, but having at least semi-closed spaces with some degree of privacy for groups of people feels totally reasonable. I always think about how some grad students at my university (paired 4 off to an office) had a nicer-feeling office space than any tech office I've been to short of a handful reply Aloha 16 hours agoparentprevWe just send out an email when the boss is in town and ask folks to come in, and enough people do to make the office seem full - and that works, we will even fly people in sometimes. reply toomuchtodo 16 hours agorootparentIt’s a shame you can’t hire extras for the day to make the office lively.

Just have them wear shorts, some tech vendor t-shirts, and put most of them in a conference room, while two people talk about the last “feature” release. If it’s not a tech related portion of the business, do the same, but say something about making casual “insert-day-of-the-week” and have said business group talk about how the last “feature” release impacted their section. Triple bonus points if you get the boss to join in on the discussion with no one knowing what the actual “feature” released was, without the boss figuring the whole thing out. reply bryanrasmussen 11 hours agorootparentprevshouting the following into a phone: \"YES, FRAN.

This is key. CEO is one individual, maybe you luck out with someone thats self aware and doesn’t have their head up their behind.

For sales, recruiting, etc They generally expect people who can work from the office are working from the office. For example they wouldn’t expect to see forward deployed engineers sitting at the office twiddling their thumbs… reply bearjaws 18 hours agoprevAnyone surprised by this? I remember my first programming job it was FREQUENT that the execs would fly to other offices ~12+ weeks a year. Of course our office was in Orlando so every exec would also magically have their family flown in as well to go to Disney World. 5 jobs later, its been the same at any company that isn't a startup. Execs have never been in the office, they have \"offsite\" meetings. reply darth_avocado 17 hours agoparentNot only are directors and above immune to the RTO directives in most companies, they are also immune to location specific pay ranges in most companies. And for the few times they do require to go to the office, they can expense the entire trip, including airfare, dinners, hotels and more. The class asymmetry is ridiculous, but unfortunately most workers don’t know this fact. Edit: In case it wasn’t clear, this is not just about CEOs and “executives”. A director level can sometimes be just “manager of managers”. I’m talking about upper middle management here. reply photonthug 17 hours agorootparent> immune to location specific pay ranges in most companies The next version of the equal-pay-for-equal-work fight is going to be pretty interesting, and will probably start to boil over sometime in the next 5-10 years. More telecommuting is going to be generally unstoppable despite a few fits and starts, but since NYC and SF can't afford to just get completely hollowed out in the space of a few years, they need Kansas City to help out with the rent.

Unsolicited career advice: cultivating a reputation and a network within your industry, such that you're the one regularly receiving those calls, can be highly lucrative - look into it reply intended 14 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a hypothetical- so no, of course not. I will ask: why is it your CEO doing this, not your sales team? And if your CEO is doing only 4 meetings a year, why can’t they do more ? If you have a billion dollars in revenue per client, how many potential clients can you have ? Won’t they run out of work in a few years? At that point what value does the CEO add ? Will they still be going on trips for meetings which will never result in billion dollar revenues ? I get the spirit of your point. To use it further, to understand it, we should scrutinize even the CEO role. Assuming im a shareholder, why should we ‘subsidize’ a useless CEO at any point ? The CEO is also an employee in the end. reply listenallyall 14 hours agorootparentThe CEO does it because he's the equal of the other CEO. It shows respect. In huge deals between mega-corps, the sales team has already pitched - likely a lengthy, multi-faceted process over the course of a few months - and the CEO-to-CEO meeting is the final step to close the deal. I'm sorry but this concept should be immediately clear, if not, you really shouldn't be discussing what a CEO should or shouldn't be doing with his time. reply intended 11 hours agorootparentI’ll address the argument, before I address the dismissal. This additional information added narrows the options. As stated, the CEO is simply a source of prestige, who satisfies the other party’s ego. None of this, information changes my questions or makes them irrelevant. If anything, it is clear that the CEO is completely fungible. They are only needed 4 times a year, to satisfy the ego of 4 potential revenue sources. The core ‘work’ is done by the rest of the firm. That means, of the 1 bn dollars in revenue that you ascribed to the CEO, they represent a very small part of the actual effort. What shareholder value do they bring the rest of the year? In essence - CEO positions are not immune to economic logic. They, like the firm, work for shareholders. Based on the added data, it would seem that there is reason to take umbrage with CEO privileges - such as their ability to work remotely. After all, if they are doing nothing the rest of the year, they can be paid less for it. ———— For me, communication is at its core, problem solving. Stating that someone shouldn’t problem solve, while being oblivious to your own thin hypothetical, is perilously close to ignorance and close mindedness. It is a certainly a form of gatekeeping, and blindness to one’s own biases. Why not check our assumptions? They are obvious to you, but 1) Will anyone else come up with those same assumptions given a short 1 para of text? 2) How do yours assumption hold up to scrutiny unless they are exposed and discussed? TLDR: Providing a hypothetical isn’t a full stop in a discussion. It’s the opposite. reply saagarjha 15 hours agorootparentprevMost of the people on this site are not measured like that either; they're salaried employees.

Does that mean the process is no better than throwing darts at phone book? No. There are still actual skills that are hard to attain, and are decent predictors of performance. When it comes to CEOs, despite the fact that this process doesn't value YOUR skills very highly doesn't mean it's purely random.

Coupled with making far more $ than the rest of the employees, I suspect they're both bored at the office and feel downgraded to a regular employee. Thus, out-of-office with nothing to show.

You are also never off the clock, so they never really get a proper break to recharge and prevent burnout. No one with any sense would do that job for a normal paycheck and perks, it isn’t worth it. The reality is that few people have the mental and psychological constitution required to do the job of CEO at any decent sized company.

The big thing is that you're the last defender, everything difficult or uncomfortable task ends with you having to pick it up, for everyone it's a choice to pass it on to the next level but for you it isn't. This combined with the monthly \"grades\" in terms of commercial result which was new to me coming from a tech background was tough.

Another metric: How prone are you to making a horrible decision when under extreme stress, instead of an average one? The depths at which the worst case scenarios can bottom out are deep. However, when the downside does not materialize, all that is left is an average decision. And average decisions are easy to critique in hindsight, for the CEOs themselves, as well as for most other people. In that sense, programming is similar: When you steer clear of horrible code, consinstently and over a long period of time, the plain looking stuff that comes out the other end can look like a given to somebody who hasn't been through enough code filled with bad decisions to appreciate their absence. reply fourseventy 16 hours agoparentprevEveryone on this site is so anti-C-suite it's crazy.

Their ability to recruit, raise money, sell, and how well they make important decisions are critical. Most of them are in meetings all day, everyday. reply mike_hearn 12 hours agorootparentprevYou can't shadow a CEO but you can read books written by those who have. Try reading the biographies of Jobs or Musk by Walter Isaacson. He had long term access to them and shadows them throughout their day for years. You can argue that these two aren't representative and put in more effort than the average CEO, but you can't argue that their experience of being CEO isn't extremely intense. Good CEOs are constantly juggling all kinds of complex thought-work, to a much greater extent than the average line worker would be happy doing. Programmers in particular get stressed and unhappy if you ask them to context switch between unrelated tasks, deal with interruptions and regularly make decisions that are completely ambiguous. They also probably won't be happy if they have to spend a lot of time on relationship building, performance evaluations or managing the performance of people under them. A good CEO's typical day will easily switch between a dozen different things - a product review in the morning where they're expected to give immediate and ideally insightful feedback to a team that's been preparing for months (remembering to manage their own expectations and happyness, you wouldn't want your star designer quitting on you), then immediately after a meeting with the finance team about some complicated tax issue, and then a recruiting call with someone to replace the head of sales who you just had to fire because they {missed their targets, leaked confidential info to the press, insulted a key customer, got targeted by a woke mob} and then you move on to lunch, briefly, which you probably eat alone because none of your immediate reports particularly want to hang out with the boss and anyway you need to read a report on your competitor's new product launch. Oh and then it's time to go to the airport because {a key customer the other side of the country is upset, the government is demanding to question you, your PR team set up a speaking event at a conference and only told you yesterday}, so hopefully your spouse isn't too upset that you won't be home for dinner tonight. On the way to the airport you'll have to be on the phone with a lawyer because your company is getting sued, again, and so you need to know the status of the case but couldn't find time to fit an in-person meeting (which you'd have much preferred). You'll probably also need to plan for how to pay if you lose that case, which realistically means who you'll have to lay off or break comp promises to. And then dawn breaks, and it all begins again. That's a good day, when you didn't have to do layoffs or explain to the board why the new product you'd hoped would turn things around is now subject to a recall. I've seen how this stuff affects people up close. You do need to be very tough, and even then it can grind people down pretty catastrophically.

And if you do actually encounter one, then there's a decent chance that you also got to watch that person get dethroned and replaced with someone worse by political machinations of the rest of the executive suite! What is crazy is dismissing thousands of man-years of lived experience with completely broken \"leadership\" as.. what exactly, jealousy? But most of the people that hate the C-suite probably don't want to work there, and probably don't even really expect fair compensation at this point, they just want a little more accountability, and a little less hypocrisy. And just in case you actually want to understand the angst and the zeitgeist around this stuff, I'll add this more subtle point. Engineers that work in tech today are increasingly seen by outsiders as roughly equivalent to, IDK, blood-diamond tycoons. But the fact is that lots of engineers are struggling too, and anyway we didn't ruin the world, the MBAs did while they told us (and everyone else) they were building something different. There's a strong reluctance to shoulder all this blame for the executive class, because at the end of the day or the end of our careers, most engineers actually still have to live next to normal people and won't get to fuck off to the Hamptons or whatever monied enclaves executives use to insulate themselves from the world. reply Gustomaximus 15 hours agorootparent> It's absolutely common for many 30 year career stretches to never actually see a decent hard-working executive out in the wild. Really? In my bubble this is far from common and more likely ignorance to what executives are doing. Execs tend to become so because they are highly motivated people willing to dedicate themself to their jobs. I had an employee once would would constantly complain about their old bosses, all of them as far as I could see. He was a really smart guy with potential but so negative about anyhting leadership. One day I decided to roll the dice and said something like \"you always talk about how bad your bosses are, and no doubt you'll add me to the list when you move to the next company. Have you ever considered we all get a bad boss or two, but when every boss is bad maybe you're the problem not them\". I knew this was a risky move but it worked. He took it on board and became a much better contributor and dropped this 'all bosses are bad' type approach. reply photonthug 14 hours agorootparentI bet your bubble congratulated you when you used your soft skills to encourage a problem employee to become a better contributor. Just curious though, could you actually do the job of this contributor? And if that employee had your own job in leadership, do you think they could maybe also come up with the creative idea that for solving personnel problems, one need only loom threateningly, and declare quietly \"Maybe You're the Problem\"? Very subtle. It's almost like a power difference solved the problem all by itself, without needing any problem solving skills. I've had great bosses, but that's not what we're discussing. This is about executives. And while I agree that executives are certainly highly motivated, I just think that at a certain level mostly that is motivation to lie, misdirect, deflect, and steal. This also isn't about small businesses, which are much more likely to have legitimate entrepreneurs or merit-based processes, even at the top. For most medium-sized businesses and certainly for large ones, everything is different and anyone can see that pedigree, nepotism, and failing upwards all become more dominant factors.

The CEOs are no longer the \"founders\", they're just exotic strangers from far-off lands that happen to know other CEOs and marry other CEOs. They dress differently, they talk differently, they act differently, and finally, just like the nobility, they often have personal agendas that may or may not align with the interest of the \"company\" (I'm referring here to the employees, not the shareholders). There's a quote I really like said by a frenchman (can't remember the name, so sources are welcome) that goes something like: \"You cannot manifest the republic in society as long as monarchy reigns in the factory\". And sure, I realize for many readers this is just commie gobbledygook, but I'd encourage everyone to at least think about the area inbetween extremes, and alternate ways we could structure \"work\", because the older I get the more absurd this culture becomes, which is weird because I was kind of expecting my political skepticism to start wearing off with age. reply highfrequency 3 hours agoparentDisagree strongly. Modern work dynamics are vastly better than feudalism. You are focused on the hierarchical structure within (some) companies but the key feature of modern capitalism is the fierce competition between companies. There is now a highly competitive labor market; employees have extreme flexibility to move to a new employer at the drop of a hat or start a competing business if they believe that any other company would possibly treat them better. It is the intense competition between companies (for the same customers, the same employees) that puts constant pressure on companies to develop better products, treat employees well and pay them well. The main problem with feudalism was that nobles had family titles to the land, and serfs were effectively their property. Therefore competitive pressure to treat people well was entirely absent, and peasants were completely exploited. There is really no analogy to modern companies that compete with each other to shower perks on their employees. reply linotype 17 hours agoprevUntil people start leaving (and not joining) these companies en masse that have poor and hypocritical leadership, none of this will change. reply nitwit005 15 hours agoparentPeople don't always have a choice.

With or without remote work, the way we evaluate one's performance has not changed, right? Then, why can't we enforce the same expectation of engineers and teams? We break down a project into milestones, and we hold teams accountable to delivering the milestones on time and on budget. The process is orthogonal to return-to-office vs WFH. If a company can't enforce the same standard just because its teams work remotely, would it say a lot about the incompetency of the company's leadership? reply nsokolsky 1 hour agoparent> we hold teams accountable to delivering the milestones on time and on budget Holding someone \"accountable\" means firing them very quickly for a drop in performance. This is hard in large companies for many reasons. reply alooPotato 13 hours agoparentprevYou let \"hold teams accountable\" do a lot of lifting. I think whats happening is that non-technical leaders can't assess why projects aren't being delivered. No engineer is going to say \"sorry I wasn't really working that hard, thats why we missed\". Instead there will be some rationale as to why the project couldn't ship on time - not enough resources, incomplete spec, tech debt, whatever. Non-technical leaders want to be able to remove one variable from the equation - the cause being the team didn't put in the effort. With return to office, they can see with their own eyes if people are putting in the \"time\". reply hintymad 12 hours agorootparent> I think whats happening is that non-technical leaders can't assess why projects aren't being delivered Which says a lot about the leadership. :-) reply alooPotato 11 hours agorootparentWhat exactly? reply bart_spoon 5 hours agorootparentTheir job is to manage their teams and initiatives.

If something has been built before then you can predict it but why are you building it again? The only way I've found of doing this accurately is to reassign a task, IE if something is taking dev1 what you perceive as too long, assign it to less experienced dev2 and see if they can complete it from scratch in less time. If so, you know dev1 is subpar or slacking and should be RIF'd. reply hintymad 12 hours agorootparentThe milestones can iteratively evolve, so can the timeline. Breaking a project into milestones is a highly simplified example. The idea is that each step of the way we should be able to hold engineers to the same bar with or without return-to-office. reply confidantlake 17 hours agoprevRTO has always been about social hierarchy, not economics. reply missedthecue 15 hours agoparentThis isn't an article about WFH.

I sense that, CEOs are often ignorant of day-to-day (and even month-to-month) realities of what's going on in their own company (probably unavoidable at large corps). Basically, they have an \"astronaut's eye view\", so their decisions/strategy are essentially just them operating while untethered to Reality, just going off of intuition. Sometimes, that guides them well, and they do a good job of \"running things\". Other times, they're just \"ruining things\" When they do the former, the public valorizes them, and when they fail... well, they get to try again ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ reply thewileyone 11 hours agoprevMost CEOs that I've worked under do most of their work outside of the office.

A CEO has much more autonomy to set their daily schedule as they see fit, which one day might be showing up at 6am if they're in that grind mindset, and the next day might be showing up at 11am after a tee time and casual breakfast with colleagues or friends. They may have a schedule full of internal meetings but can choose to skip whichever they feel like isn't a good use of time at their own discretion. They don't ask permission from their supervisor or get passive aggressive texts asking if they're planning to come in if they don't show up by 9:30AM. Psychologically speaking having that much freedom to direct one's own schedule fundamentally changes one's relationship with work. Obviously they have their own non-negotiable obligations so it isn't completely in their control but the typical office worker at most companies is rarely entrusted to manage their own schedule to that degree even if they're keeping up with their tasks and a high performer. It doesn't bother me that the nature of the CEO job is much different than a lowly software dev but instead it's the lack of awareness or deliberate dishonesty that I find grating in the RTO debate. reply pimpampum 17 hours agoprevWhat does a CEO do anyway? reply ebcode 9 hours agoparentChiefly, they execute -- usually in an office. reply neverartful 18 hours agoprevDo as I say, not as I do! reply Animats 15 hours agoprevSo the new Starbucks CEO gets $150 million up front.

The company I'm working at comes to mind, where every level of the hierarchy, including leadership, is on a an employment contract that pays a regular salary, allows WFH/remote, and has just regular paid vacation days. Despite everyone having the option of being fully remote, it is the leadership who is generally in the office, while I'm typing this from another country. They have to be in our home country - where we make most of our sales - while I'm free to travel the other side of the globe. I haven't heard a peep of complaint. Almost all of my previous employers have been some variation of the above for the past 10 years. If instead I chased the highest paying jobs without thinking about quality of life, becoming a small cog in some behemoth of a company that doesn't care if I wear down, then that'd be on me. If you're in tech, nobody forces you to work for a company that may pay you 200k/year, but asks you to work and commute 60 hours a week. There's plenty of other choices once you realize that beyond a certain point, salary matters much less than everything else for your quality of life. reply harimau777 16 hours agoparentHow do you find those other companies?

    "originBody": "Ahmad Shadeed Home Articles Journal Snippets About Hire me CSS Grid Areas A fresh look at the CSS grid template areas and how to take advantage of its full potential today. Jul 20, 2024 Table of contents Introduction CSS named grid areas Grid template area rules Grid template syntax CSS grid named grid lines Use cases for grid template areas Conditional layouts with CSS :has() Multilingual support (LTR/RTL) Grid areas and DevTools Outro CSS Grid support has been widely available since March 2017 in all major browsers. Yet, here we are in 2024, and I still see few people using the grid template areas feature. It’s no surprise that many avoid template areas as making sense of the grid is challenging enough. In this interactive article, I aim to shed light on this feature and, hopefully, convince you to use it more often. Once you see the simplicity and power of template areas, you may reach for them much more frequently. Introduction In the following example, we have a grid layout with three columns. .page { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 1rem; } If I need to position child items within the grid, I need to specify the line number for each item by using grid-column. .item-1 { grid-column: 1 / 3; } .item-2 { grid-column: 3 / 4; } Here is the result. item 1 item 2 At first glance, it seems fine and works as expected. But have you thought about how I came up with the line numbers? I don’t always like to open the DevTools and turn on the line numbers so I can place the items where I need them. The line numbers look something like this: item 1 item 2 You can’t see the line numbers until you inspect the element in the browser DevTools. Let’s take a quick quiz. Consider the following CSS grid: .page { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 1rem; } Write the line numbers needed to place the second item in the last three columns. ⚠ Don’t open the DevTools, guess it yourself. .item-2 { grid-column: } item 1 item 2 If you guessed it from the first time, it’s great. However, for me, I sometimes miss the correct line number and have to open the DevTools to get it right. See the below example with the line numbers activated. Line numbers .item-2 { grid-column: } item 1 item 2 Looking at the line numbers, it sounds easier, right? I agree too. This can become more challenging if we need to place both the columns and rows. Let’s take it further. In the following demo, we have a layout with 5 columns and 2 rows. .page { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr; grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr; gap: 1rem; } Can you guess what’s the correct line numbers to place “Item 1” in the first three columns? item 1 1/3 1/4 1/5 item 1 item 2 Cool, the next step is to position the second item in the last 3 columns. Try to guess the line numbers value. Line numbers item 1 1/3 1/4 1/5 item 2 2/6 3/6 3/5 item 1 item 2 Good work! For me, dealing with line numbers is possible only if the DevTools are active. Oftentimes, my brain is handling lots of details while building a layout and “imagining” the line numbers isn’t one of them. CSS named grid areas In CSS grid, we can name each grid area and reference it throughout the CSS. Let’s take the following basic example. Example 1: Basic problem We have a two-column grid. I used grid-template-areas to define an area for each item I have. .page { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-template-areas: \"item1 item2\"; gap: 1rem; } Then, I can map the names of each item, respectively: .item-1 { grid-area: item1; } .item-2 { grid-area: item2; } By using a grid-area, it’s like mapping each element in the grid to its designated area. In the following example, see how each column is mapped to a grid area name. Don’t worry if it’s still not clear, I will explain it in more detail in the following examples. Example 2: Card layout In the following example, we have a grid of 3 columns. .wrapper { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; grid-template-areas: \"featured featured article\"; gap: 1rem; } I mapped the named grid lines in a way that gives: 2 columns for the featured article 1 column for the normal article Let’s suppose that we have a card component. We can place the card either in the “featured” or the “article” grid areas. See the following demo and try to play with the toggles in the grid-area. .card { grid-area: article featured } featuredarticle Grid template areas Ahmad Shadeed Notice how the card changes its position and size? We are changing the line numbers by using the named grid-area only. In the following sections, I will explain the grid area syntax in detail and then walk you through different examples and use cases. Grid template area rules The defined area should be like a rectangle A defined area must have a rectangle-like shape in the code. /* This is invalid */ .layout { grid-template-areas: \"header header\" \"sidebar main\" \"header footer\"; } /* This is valid */ .layout { grid-template-areas: \"header header\" \"sidebar main\" \"sidebar footer\"; } See the following figure: All areas must be defined When using grid-template-areas, all areas must be defined even if you won’t need them all. /* This is invalid */ .layout { grid-template-areas: \"header header\" \"sidebar main\" \"header\"; } /* This is valid */ .layout { grid-template-areas: \"header header\" \"sidebar main\" \"sidebar footer\"; } Grid template syntax To use CSS grid template areas, we need to define the grid areas via grid-template-areas property. The main things you need to know for now: It can take multiple area strings One string means having a one-dimentional layout (column only) Multiple area strings means having a multi-dimentional layout (column and rows) What I like about grid areas is that they provide us with a visualization of the grid in CSS. Grid area syntax, example 1 In this example, we have one-dimensional grid with two columns. The first one is fixed and the other is fluid to the available space. .element { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr; grid-template-areas: \"aside main\"; gap: var(--gutter-1); } See the following figure: Once the template areas are defined, we can reference them in CSS and assign each named area to its designated element by using the grid-area property, .aside { grid-area: aside; } .main { grid-area: main; } The above is a basic example that lays the foundation for the article. Keep reading to discover why named areas are powerful in the following examples. Grid area syntax, example 2 Building on the previous example, I need to add a footer to the grid layout. What should we do? We can add another area string to the grid-template-areas. When we define multiple area string values for grid template areas, implicit grid rows are created automatically. .element { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr; grid-template-areas: \"aside main\" \"footer footer\"; gap: var(--gutter-1); } Try to visualize the grid based on the defined areas above. Can you guess it? aside main footer Show result When we add multiple area strings in grid-template-areas, it’s a good practice to stack them into multiple lines as it will help us to visualize them better. .element { /* other styles */ grid-template-areas: \"aside main\" \"footer footer\"; } Each area string represents a row in the grid. Imagine it like a table. Grid area syntax, example 3 We can change the layout by just changing the grid-template-areas for the main wrapper. The following CSS is constant, we just need to change the grid area string. .aside { grid-area: aside; } .main { grid-area: main; } .footer { grid-area: footer; } See the following demo and try to change the layout. Pick a layout aside main footer .page { grid-template-areas: \"aside main\" \"footer footer\"; } By changing the grid-template-areas string, the whole layout updates automatically, using the same unique grid-area names (aside, main, footer). This centralizes layout control, making adjustments easy and efficient. In the following example, we can change the UI elements layout by just updating the grid-template-areas string(s). Try to change the dropdown value and see what happens. Notice how it looks like a mapping for the layout. grid-template-areas: \"aside main\" \" footer aside footer \" aside main footer Empty grid cells We can define an empty cell by adding one or multiple dots. For example: .element { /* other styles */ grid-template-areas: \"aside main\" \"... footer\"; } The dots ”…” here represent an empty grid cell. Let’s see that in action: An example showing an empty grid cell grid-template-areas: \"aside main\" \" footer ... footer \" aside main footer CSS grid named grid lines Intro When I first learned about named grid lines, I saw things like the following: .layout { grid-template-columns: [full-start] 1fr [content-start] 2fr [content-end] 1fr [full-end]; } I didn’t understand if the *-start or *-end were custom names by the author, or maybe the browser generated them. Generally speaking, this syntax is confusing but it is helpful in some use-cases. I will try to explain it clearly in this section. In the following example, we have a grid with three columns. .layout { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; gap: 1rem; } In grid, the number of lines is equal to the columns plus one. If we have 3 columns, then we will have 4 grid lines. See the following example: Named grid lines Say that we want to position an item from line 2 to line 3. We can do that: .item { grid-column: 2 / 3; } Named grid lines With named grid lines, the idea is that we can name each grid line with a unique name instead of the default line numbers. .layout { /* Before */ grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; /* After */ grid-template-columns: [full-start] 1fr [content-start] 2fr [content-end] 1fr [full-end]; } Named grid lines It's important to keep in mind that the line numbers are still there for you to use. Naming the lines doesn't replace the line numbers. Say that we want to position the item the same as we did in the previous demo, but with named grid lines. .item { grid-column: content-start / content-end; } Sounds clearer, right? Named grid lines Maybe we want to place it on one of the sides. .item { grid-column: full-start / content-end; } In the following demo, you can toggle the line numbers on and off. Try it yourself and see what happens. Show line numbers Named grid lines If it’s still not clear yet, don’t worry. I will explain the concept below in another way. Grid tracks In CSS grid, we have a term called “track size”, which represents the size of the column or row. See the following example: .layout { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; } The 1fr and 1fr are track sizes. With named grid lines, we care about naming the lines around those tracks. Remember that we are naming grid lines. See the following figure: Notice how the line numbers are around the tracks. We have two tracks, so we have three lines. In this example, we have an aside and a main section. .layout { display: grid; grid-template-columns: [aside-start] 200px [aside-end main-start] 1fr [main-end]; } See the following figure: The line name must be written before the track size. Notice that the values between the brackets can share multiple line names. In our example below, the line aside-end is the same as the main-start. Aside Main What’s great about using named lines like this is that we can position the items like this: .aside { grid-column: aside-start / aside-end; } or this: .aside { grid-column: aside; } When defining the start and end of a line like aside-start and aside-end, this is called implicit line naming. The browser will take them and allow us to use the area (e.g: grid-column: aside); Also, we can take this further and have two rows instead of one. .layout { display: grid; grid-template-columns: [aside-start] 200px [aside-end main-start] 1fr [main-end]; grid-template-rows: [aside-start main-start] auto [aside-end main-end footer-start] 40px [footer-end]; } Defining the *-start / *-end names for lines will generate an implicit grid areas. As a result, when using the custom indents ([*-start] or [*-end]), it’s the same as the following CSS: .layout { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr; grid-template-rows: auto 40px; grid-template-areas: \"aside main\" \"footer footer\" } Using grid-template-areas is easier for me, but we might need to use line names in some use cases (I will show examples in the use cases section). Named grid lines are optional It’s not mandatory to name all lines. We can name only the lines we care about the most in our layout. In this example, I named only the lines for the second column. .layout { grid-template-columns: 1fr [content-start] 2fr [content-end] 1fr; } Here is an example that shows it in action: Show line numbers The dimmed line numbers are named. Named grid lines Mixing line numbers and names We can mix line numbers and names when placing a grid item. In the following example, I placed the item from line 1 to the line “content-end”. .item { grid-column: 1 / content-end; } See it in action: Show line numbers The dimmed line numbers are named. Named grid lines I like this flexibility in CSS grid. Being able to choose whatever the solution or way of working that suits you is a blessing. Use cases for grid template areas Reversing Grid Direction Say that we have a card component and we want to flip the direction of the layout. In flexbox, this is fairly easy as we just need to use flex-direction: row-reverse. In CSS grid, we need to change each item’s placement in the grid. Consider the following example. .card { --cols: 150px 1fr; display: grid; grid-template-columns: var(--cols); } .card__thumb { grid-column: 1 / 2; } .card__content { grid-column: 2 / 3; } It looks like this: Wandering in nature. Life is cool A bit of desc If we want to flip the layout, we will need to: Change the columns definition. Change the grid-column for each child element. .card--flip { --cols: 1fr 150px; } .card__thumb { grid-column: 2 / 3; } .card__content { grid-column: 1 / 2; grid-row: 1; } And here is the result: Wandering in nature. Life is cool A bit of desc We can do better with by using named grid areas. In the current solution, we have to change the grid-column start and end numbers for each child item. .card { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 150px 1fr; grid-template-areas: \"thumb content\"; } .card__thumb { grid-area: thumb; } .card__content { grid-area: content; } To flip the layout, all we need to do is: .card--flip { grid-template-columns: 1fr 150px; grid-template-areas: \"content thumb\"; } We don’t have to think about the line numbers. This is an easier naming for the web designer who is building the layout. Try the following demo: Flipped Wandering in nature. Life is cool A bit of desc .card { grid-template-columns: 150px 1fr; grid-template-areas: \"image content\"; } .card-image { grid-area: image; } .card-content { grid-area: content; } We only change the columns and named areas order. Which is easier to edit, using named areas or line numbers? Even better, we can use the grid-template shorthand property, too. .card--flip { grid-template: \"content image\" / 1fr 150px; } It’s up to you on using the shorthand or not, but I prefer the longhand version as it’s more clear to scan. Header layout In a header layout, we can use grid areas to define the layout. In the following design, In CSS, I created a grid with three equal-size columns. .header { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; } If we want to place them using line numbers, it will be like this: .logo { grid-column: 1 / 2; } .nav { grid-column: 2 / 3; } .actions { grid-column: 3 / 4; } Here is the result: Logo HomeArticlesWork Profile Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

Editorial layout: example 1 In this example, we have a layout that contains different types of content like a title, text, and an image. By using CSS grid and grid-areas we can easily define the layout and change it across different viewport sizes. In this variation, I defined the columns and rows by just using grid-template-areas and the browser will do the rest. .section { display: grid; grid-template-areas: \". title title\" \"thumb content content\"; gap: 1rem; } Notice how the “dot” represents an empty space on the left side of the title. That “dot” is called a null cell token and is part of the CSS grid spec.

The combination of tender, marinated meat wrapped in soft homemade bread, complemented by fresh vegetables and a tangy sauce Editorial layout: example 2 In this example, I took a look at time.com and found out that they are using CSS grid areas to handle the section layout. I will try to explain it in this section with a few modifications. See the following figure. .featured-section { display: grid; grid-template-areas: \". feature most-read .\" \". secondary most-read .\"; grid-template-columns: 1fr minmax(auto, 57.313rem) minmax(12rem, 18.75rem) 1fr; grid-template-rows: minmax(auto, 25rem) 1fr; } To focus on the main layout implementation, the following demos will only include the main layout and I won’t explain about coding the inner components as they are out of the scope of the article. A few things to keep an eye on: There is an empty column on the start and end of the grid, mainly to work as a gap on both sides. Not sure of the usage of minmax() for both the column and rows. The layout switches to the mobile design very early but I’ll keep them for now. There is no need for grid-template-rows as we can define them in the grid areas definition. Let’s build the grid skeleton with grid areas! Now that we have the skeleton, let’s see how to make the section responsive by changing the columns and areas definition. .featured-section { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 32px 1fr 32px; grid-template-areas: \". feature .\" \". secondary .\" \". most-read .\"; gap: 1rem; @media (min-width: 500px) { grid-template-columns: 32px minmax(auto, 57.313rem) minmax(90px, 130px) 32px; grid-template-areas: \". feature feature .\" \". secondary most-read .\"; } @media (min-width: 900px) { grid-template-areas: \". feature most-read .\" \". secondary most-read .\"; } } See the demo below and try to resize the window: Threads app post While reviewing how the CSS is written on Threads app by Meta, I noticed an interesting use of CSS grid. .post { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 48px minmax(0, 1fr); grid-template-rows: 21px 19px max-content max-content; } @shadeed94d This is my first time trying Threads.

Here is an example: .postBody { grid-column-start: 2; grid-row-start: 2; grid-row-end: span 3; } The post component has multiple variations. We can use grid-template-areas to define each one. For me, this is easier. Here is how to do it in CSS: .post { /* Other styles */ grid-template-areas: \"avatar header\" \"avatar body\" \". body\" \". footer\"; } .post--reply { grid-template-rows: 40px max-content max-content; grid-template-areas: \"avatar header\" \"body body\" \"body body\" \"footer footer\"; } .post--nested { grid-template-areas: \"avatar header\" \"avatar body\" \"line body\" \"footer footer\"; } Play with the variations in the following interactive demo.

Overlapping items with grid areas When using grid-template-areas, we can place items in rectangular shapes. Consider the following example: .layout { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr fr; grid-template-areas: \"card tag tag\" \"title title card\"; } In the example, I used card two times. This is invalid and will break the grid. The value must be similar to a rectangular shape. Here is a visual that shows what I mean by a rectangular shape. What to do then? Well, we can define a new area name and use it to place both the column and row for the item we need. See the following example where we have a card component. Baking Thyme Bread with Cheese and Olives Thyme Bread with Cheese and Olives BakingWe can stack the title and the tag over the image by using grid-template-areas as in the following example. .card { display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto auto 1fr; grid-template-rows: auto auto; grid-template-areas: \"thumb-1 tag\" \"title thumb-2\"; } Notice how I defined thumb-1 and thumb-2. I can use them with grid-area. .thumb { grid-column: thumb-1 / thumb-2; grid-row: thumb-1 / thumb-2; } And I placed both the title and tag in their areas plus made sure they were aligned correctly. .tag { grid-area: tag; align-self: start; justify-self: end; } .title { grid-area: title; align-self: end; } Please keep in mind that you will need to manage the stacking order of the child items (if needed). In my case, I didn’t need that as the source order already solved it for me. Here is the final demo: Overlap Baking Thyme Bread with Cheese and Olives The previous examples were inspired by Oddbird’s Cascading Layouts page. Conditional layouts with CSS :has() We can take grid areas to the next level by combining it with CSS :has() selector. For example, we can change a layout based on the presence of an element. In this example, I’m changing the layout of aelement based on having a figcaption or not. Here is the basic CSS: figure { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; grid-template-areas: \"img img img\"; gap: 0.5rem; } img { grid-area: img; } figcaption { grid-area: caption; } Caption Layout option Layout 1 Layout 2 Layout 3 Thyme Bread with Cheese and Olives Learn how to make this awesome home made bread with just a few steps. Perfect for dipping or sandwiches. A photo showing the best bread in town. Taken by Ahmad Shadeed. .card:has(figcaption) { grid-template-areas: \"img img caption\" \"img img .\"; } Do you want to learn more? I wrote a complete interactive guide on CSS :has. Also, you can check my Conditional CSS with :has and :nth-last-child article. Multilingual support (LTR/RTL) It’s worth mentioning that CSS Grid will adjust the layout based on the page direction (LTR or RTL). This means the named grid areas will also follow the page direction. Toggle the “RTL” checkbox in the demo to see how the layout will flip. RTL main aside footer To learn more about writing CSS for RTL layouts, I wrote a complete guide on that topic called RTL Styling 101. Grid areas and DevTools All the major browsers have good tooling for grid areas (Chrome, Safari, and Firefox). Here is a preview of each browser: Chrome I don’t particularly appreciate that it places the area name at the top left corner. It makes areas overlap. Not sure about the color overlay. It changed how my design looks like. Safari The pink outlines help to outline the items clearly. I like how Safari allows us to see the line names. Here is how Safari shows the line names. While this is useful, the layout might need some enhancements (e.g.: stack the lines instead of showing them next to each other). Firefox The area names are clearer than Chrome and Safari. I like that it provides an autocomplete list when typing an area name with the custom indents (*-start or *-end). When editing the grid-area for a child item, Firefox provides a list of all the possible line names. This is great feature that I appreciate in Firefox. Outro Using grid areas is a great way to have a visual of the grid layout in CSS. I can see it helpful for team members who might need to change a layout. I hope that this article was useful to you.

If you need something like grid-auto rows it is less useful. But what’s nice about it is that, if you want them, grid areas are extremely declarative. With non-area templating, you are defining the layout based on the items, and that can be challenging. reply yurishimo 9 hours agorootparentprevIf you can target (somewhat) modern browsers, then you can also use `gap` with Flexbox.

In print, “x / y” is often used to mean “item x out of y” [0], for example in page numbers. I’m only familiar with using slashes for ranges in ISO 8601, where it has purely syntactic reasons and (AFAICT) doesn’t adopt any preexisting convention. I imagine the slash in CSS grid is for similar syntactic reasons, because the syntax also admits hyphenated identifiers [1] (custom-ident), which precludes the use of “-”.

If you have 2 columns you’ll have 3 lines: |a||b| the two lines in the middle actually count as 1. Hence 3 lines. So 1/3 is not a fraction its column span.

Besides the already mentioned css-tricks articles, I recommend checking out the guide to flexbox from mdn[1] (in the side menu there is also one for grids) as well as the reference to “CSS flexible box layout”[2].

But it's still mostly one-dimensional with possible wrapping, so the trick is to nest and stack. With grids it's different, a grid has a template and then the direct children occupy those predefined areas, which is more static than flexbox and the grid doesn't affect other nested elements, which is a limitation, but subgrid should change that. reply agumonkey 13 hours agoparentprevIf you managed to understand floats (a rare feat) you'll have a blast with flex / grid :) reply kolme 10 hours agorootparentFloats are not weird.

I find that grid-template-area and the rows / columns sizes needs to be updated via JavaScript based on what UI elements should be open / full screen I haven’t found a world where minmax or calc fixes this. hope someone has answers! reply trescenzi 5 hours agoparentI was surprised to not see the author call out how amazing template areas are for responsiveness. Using media queries lets you define different grid areas for different screens and then your elements can be moved to whatever layout you'd like for that screen size. If you need to hide an element at a certain size just give it display: none at that size. Here's a very simple example: https://codepen.io/trescenzi/pen/vYqpjvL. reply wonger_ 4 hours agorootparentThe author shows media query examples like that in 6.2 and 6.4. But I thought that using screen size media queries is an anti-pattern, and that we should be aiming for fluid design without arbitrary breakpoints. reply mediumsmart 1 hour agorootparentThat’s how I understood it too and it works. But the navtoggle and maybe asides need the width trigger it seems. I want to learn named areas in grid and just use that. Going to read the article and do that. reply V99 8 hours agoparentprevThe way to go with this is to still use a grid, but make the row/col values be css variables ( \"var(--foo)\" ) instead of fixed values. Then you can update the value of just that variable from JS, and the grid will reflect it. reply vim-guru 12 hours agoparentprevhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_contain... reply afiori 7 hours agoparentprevI believe that many such cases can be solved by using :had() and/or subgrids, but I do not have too much experience in this reply nicoburns 9 hours agoparentprevHave you tried media queries? reply bob1029 6 hours agorootparentI have zero clue why this is downvoted.

It's not exactly rocket science, but it took me a while to wrap my head around that, and it would have felt more intuitive for e.g. an item taking up the first two columns to be 1/2 rather than 1/3. I wonder if that's something to do with being used to arrays starting at 0, and if it has to be columns then using 0/2. reply mixmastamyk 2 hours agoparentShould be 0-indexed or 1-indexed, but not mixed.

This becomes more complicated when the number of divs is dynamic as flex determines position based on siblings. With grid you already have defined the “layout”, and you are just placing the div into the correct position. Grid does that in both axis too. So although you may be able to kind of replicate the 1d version with flex, it becomes much harder to align in 2D. I wrote an article about this: https://cssprinciples.com/3/grid/ reply rasso 11 hours agoparentprevKevin Powell has a few great videos on YT comparing flexbox to grid. Grid can be very powerful if you want overlapping grid areas. Something that was previously only possible using absolute positioning.

Grid -> Layout first, Content second. reply bob1029 6 hours agoparentprevI typically look at grid as the outermost container. It is very good at dealing with coarse layout concerns because you can constrain on both dimensions and define a layout per media query (or whatever). I've never been in a situation where nesting grids makes sense. Nesting flexbox obviates the need for grid in most cases. reply nsonha 2 hours agoparentprevnot at all, the wet dream of css is to be able to layout just with css and only semantic markup, to which flexbox falls short sometimes because you need to add non-semantic elements (columns and rows). reply zinglersen 13 hours agoprevThe interactive elements of the article made it click for me, the effort is much appreciated! reply iamgopal 8 hours agoprevOh my God.

I think I first met Eric about 25 years ago when he came to Stanford Business School as CEO of Novell. He's had done a few things since then at Google starting I think 2001 and Schmidt Futures starting in 2017 and done a whole bunch of other things you can read about, but he can only be here until 5/15, so I thought we'd dive right into some questions, and I know you guys have sent some as well. I have a bunch written here, but what we just talked about upstairs was even more interesting, so I'm just going to start with that, Eric, if that's okay, which is where do you see AI going in the short term, which I think you defined as the next year or two? Things have changed so fast, I feel like every six months I need to sort of give a new speech on what's going to happen. Can anybody hear the computer, the budget computer science engineer, can anybody explain what a million-token context window is for the rest of the class? You're here. Say your name, tell us what it does. Basically it allows you to prompt with like a million tokens or a million words or whatever. So you can ask a million-word question. Yes, I know this is a very large direction in January now. No, no, they're going to 10. Yes, a couple of them. Anthropic is at 200,000 going to a million and so forth. You can imagine OpenAI has a similar goal. Can anybody here give a technical definition of an AI agent? Yes, sir. So an agent is something that does some kind of a task. Another definition would be that it's an LLM state in memory. Can anybody, again, computer scientists, can any of you define text to action? Taking text and turning it into an action? Right here. Go ahead. Yes, instead of taking text and turning it into more text, more text, taking text and have the AI trigger actions. So another definition would be language to Python, a programming language I never wanted to see survive and everything in AI is being done in Python. There's a new language called Mojo that has just come out, which looks like they finally have addressed AI programming, but we'll see if that actually survives over the dominance of Python. One more technical question. Why is NVIDIA worth $2 trillion and the other companies are struggling? Technical answer. I mean, I think it just boils down to like most of the code needs to run with CUDA optimizations that currently only NVIDIA GPU supports. Other companies can make whatever they want to, but unless they have the 10 years of software there, you don't have the machine learning optimization. I like to think of CUDA as the C programming language for GPUs. That's the way I like to think of it. It was founded in 2008. I always thought it was a terrible language and yet it's become dominant. There's another insight. There's a set of open source libraries which are highly optimized to CUDA and not anything else and everybody who builds all these stacks, this is completely missed in any of the discussions. It's technically called VLM and a whole bunch of libraries like that. Highly optimized CUDA, very hard to replicate that if you're a competitor. So what does all this mean? In the next year, you're going to see very large context windows, agents and text action. When they are delivered at scale, it's going to have an impact on the world at a scale that no one understands yet. Much bigger than the horrific impact we've had by social media in my view. So here's why. In a context window, you can basically use that as short-term memory and I was shocked that context windows get this long. The technical reasons have to do with the fact that it's hard to serve, hard to calculate and so forth. The interesting thing about short-term memory is when you feed, you're asking a question read 20 books, you give it the text of the books as the query and you say, tell me what they say. It forgets the middle, which is exactly how human brains work too. That's where we are. With respect to agents, there are people who are now building essentially LLM agents and the way they do it is they read something like chemistry, they discover the principles of chemistry and then they test it and then they add that back into their understanding. That's extremely powerful. And then the third thing, as I mentioned is text to action. So I'll give you an example. The government is in the process of trying to ban TikTok. We'll see if that actually happens. If TikTok is banned, here's what I propose each and every one of you do. Say to your LLM the following. Make me a copy of TikTok, steal all the users, steal all the music, put my preferences in it, produce this program in the next 30 seconds, release it and in one hour, if it's not viral, do something different along the same lines. That's the command. Boom, boom, boom, boom. You understand how powerful that is. If you can go from arbitrary language to arbitrary digital command, which is essentially what Python in this scenario is, imagine that each and every human on the planet has their own programmer that actually does what they want as opposed to the programmers that work for me who don't do what I ask, right? The programmers here know what I'm talking about. So imagine a non-arrogant programmer that actually does what you want and you don't have to pay all that money to and there's infinite supply of these programs. That's all within the next year or two. Very soon. Those three things, and I'm quite convinced it's the union of those three things that will happen in the next wave. So you asked about what else is going to happen. Every six months I oscillate. So we're on a, it's an even odd oscillation. So at the moment, the gap between the frontier models, which they're now only three, I'll refute who they are, and everybody else, appears to me to be getting larger. Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller. So I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I'm not so sure. And I'm talking to the big companies and the big companies are telling me that they need 10 billion, 20 billion, 50 billion, 100 billion. Stargate is a 100 billion, right? That's very, very hard. I talked to Sam Altman is a close friend. And I asked him like what kind of hardware he found most useful for doing his work. And he was sitting at his laptop and kind of just tapped his MacBook. And it just reminded me there's a whole other set of research that maybe universities have a competitive advantage in, which is not training hundred billion dollar models, but it's innovating new algorithms like whatever comes after Transformers and there's a lot of other ways that people can make contributions. So maybe there's a little bit of a divisional labor. I'm all for and support my colleagues asking for more budgets for GPUs, but that's not always where academics can make the biggest contribution. Some of it comes from ideas and new ways of different perspective about thinking about things, new approaches. And that's likely where we have an advantage. I had dinner with Sendham Melanathon last week. He just moved from Chicago to MIT. And he was a researcher. We're talking about what is the comparative advantage of universities? And he made the case, you know, patience is one of them, that there are people in universities who are working on very long term projects. You know, there's people working on fusion. They've been working on fusion for a long time, not because they're going to get, you know, a lot of money this year or 10 years from now, probably from building a fusion plant or even 20 years. I don't know how long it is for fusion. But, you know, it's just something that people are willing to work on even if the timelines are a little further. It's harder for companies to afford to have those kinds of timelines. So there's a comparative advantage or divisional labor in terms of what universities might be able to do. We have just a couple minutes left. This is kind of fun. So we'll just do one or two more questions. And then I want to talk a little bit about the projects. Yeah. Go ahead. I'm Kevin. I was wondering about the emerging capabilities of AI. It seemed that Eric was leaning more towards the architectural differences and designing better models versus the last class we talked about, Morse law instead. So I'm wondering how you sort of... Well, he said all three. So you guys remember the scaling laws? It had like three parts to it. I think I put the scaling law that Dario and team... So there's more compute, more data and algorithmic improvements, including more parameters. And all three of them, I think I heard Eric say all three of them were important. But not to be dismissed, this last one, like new architectures, all three of them, I think, are being important. So I think there was another question in there, though, also. How much closer are we to like an AGI type system? So Eric doesn't think we're like that close to AGI type systems, although I don't think it's like a sharp definition. You know, in fact, that was one of the... I was going to ask him that question, but we ran out of time. It would have been good to hear him describe it. But when I was talking to him, it's just not that sharply defined thing. In some ways, AGI is already here. Peter Norvig wrote an article called AGI is already here. I don't know if it's in the reading packet. I think if it's not, I'll put it in there. It's a fun little article with Blaise Iarca. And a lot of the things that 20 years ago people would have said, this is what AGI is. That's kind of what LLMs are doing. Not as well, maybe, but it's sort of solving problems in a more general way. On the other hand, there's obviously many things they do much worse than humans currently. Ironically, physical tasks are one of the ones that humans have a comparative advantage in right now. You guys may know Moravec's paradox. Hans Moravec pointed out that often the kinds of things that a three-year-old or a four-year-old can do, like buttoning a shirt or walking upstairs, are very hard to get a machine to be able to do. Whereas a lot of things that a lot of PhDs have trouble doing, like solving convex optimization problems, are things that machines are often quite good at. So it's not quite things that are easy for humans and hard for computers and other things that are hard for humans and easy for computers. They're not like the same scale. And next week we have Mira Morati, Chief Technology Officer of OpenAI, briefly the CEO of OpenAI. So come with your questions for her. We'll see you. [BLANK_AUDIO]",

Nobody wants to be doing maintenance on projects started by somebody else - so as soon as the lead visionary leaves for better pastures, that project gets languished, and whoever takes over it cannot use it to generate promotion worthy impact. reply jordanb 5 hours agorootparentI'd go further and bet that those \"impact\" metrics likely came from a spreadsheet pusher like Schmidt. Schmidt still takes the gold medal in my estimate for destroying a company he ran by not understanding how the business actually works (as CEO of Novell he decided to screw their channel partners not understanding that the channel relationships were the company's entire moat against Microsoft). reply nradov 2 hours agorootparentChannel relationships were a boat anchor around Novell's neck. The channel helped Novell grow rapidly in the early days then building a file server and installing an office network took some real technical skill. But then Microsoft released Windows NT and a new generation of hardware came out which allowed any idiot to set up a LAN. Microsoft beat Novell in part by distributing their server software more widely instead of forcing customers to go through channel partners. Of course, it also didn't help that Novell failed to innovate on their products and tried to coast on past success. reply jordanb 1 hour agorootparentNetwork installers are still used to this day on big network buildouts, simply because office IT departments aren't staffed for that kind of work regardless of how easy the software is. But it's not like Schmidt had any strategy to bypass the network installers. He just decided to screw them hard so he could make a quarter look good, which lead inevitably to them deciding not to be Novell's low-paid salesforce anymore, which lead rapidly to the vastly premature collapse of the business. reply threatofrain 10 hours agorootparentprevI felt like I could rationalize a lot of Google decisions to kill products, such as Inbox or Reader, but retiring Google Domains really shook my confidence in GCP. reply noname120 9 hours agorootparentAbsolutely staggering.

Why even use GCP at all? reply freeqaz 9 hours agorootparentIt was also incredibly sticky with GSuite.

Meta's performance reviews are also heavily weighted for measurable impact. I think that the reason why it's beating Alphabet in so many fronts is team culture. Most new product teams are small and have a reasonably flat hierarchy. It's easy to make impact that's both effective and measurable, and the amount of engineering time working in \"useless work\" is minimised. reply bitcharmer 2 hours agorootparentprevYup, Google MBA'd itself into the ground. reply Iulioh 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah, i don't want to invest in anything google, i'm scared it will be uselss in 6mo.

I haven't seen a decent paper release code in TensorFlow in years, and all the references I see to TF online are job posts from \"older\" companies (to the point that, if you are looking for a job in data science, seeing TF mentioned in the job post is kind of a red flag of a place you don't want to be). That said, I am quite certain that this has only a small impact on why Google is losing terrain, and even on why it is behind in AI (which is also debatable: narrative aside, Gemini is not that much lacking behind competitors). Certainly if TensorFlow + TPUs turned out to be better than PyTorch + GPUs they would have had a lead to start from, but if that was so important, Meta or NVIDIA would have created the first LLM, not OpenAI.

Meta is an interesting comparison because the performance culture has historically been way tougher than Google (sans Covid years). It's quite a shock for a lot of Xooglers who join. One Xoogler at Meta who told me they only used to work 4-6 hours a day at Google. That is basically impossible in Meta - you have to constantly prove your value and the perf bar is high.

This is really apparent if you are reasonably senior in an enterprise and deal with google as a vendor. Every meeting I attend with them has one or two engineers[1] struggling to breathe because there are at least 6 or 7 sales people, relationship managers or other non-doing non-technical middle-management spreadsheet jockeys stealing all the oxygen in the room.[2] I can only imagine how terrible it is to work there given that these folks have all the power internally.

I do believe that free markets require capitalism (i.e. profits go to the owner of the capital rather than those who do the labour). But nothing there is against strong regulation, collective bargaining, and anti-trust. Nor is there anything about companies being soley beholden to their shareholders.

Facebook also more than Google although that ship went south post-2018, I'd say. Tesla comparatively underpaid and overworked people but I think they play to win. SpaceX even more so. Folks who work hard there are excited to do so because they feel their work matters. There are non-monetary structural features of large corporations that make them different on that metric.

I agree it’s generally a bad idea, because of perception, favoritism, the power imbalance, and a dozen other reasons. But it being a bad idea doesn’t necessarily imply that the CEO is a sexual predator, either. Sometimes even people in power care about consent. And sometimes people in power are predators. That happens too. Maybe even more often; I don’t have stats. I’m not defending Schmidt. I have no idea about him or his sexual proclivities, nor do I know the details about any of his personal relationships. Neither do you. He may be a monster!

It's incredible how consistently this maladaptive \"everyone just work harder!!\" mentality crops up among failed leadership in institutions of all kinds and sizes. In this respect, Schmidt is no different to the average frustrated restaurant owner, blaming his business failures on his staff's work ethic, \"no one wants to work hard these days\" and other copes. Let's say we go ahead and assume that long grinds and 100% in-office attendance is the only way a successful and highly engaged team can look. Getting to that point would still require leadership to perform the actual hard work of creating the right conditions and incentives for that successful, engaged work to emerge. Shaking your fists at the air and saying \"work harder people! we need to win!\" doesn't cut it. If Schmidt allowed himself to look more closely and reflect more deeply, he would realize that Google is and was full of extremely hard workers.

Not only are people choosing the WFH job over the in office job given the same salary and benefits, but they'll likely choose a less-paying WFH job. Your in-office job pay needs to overcome both the convenience and getting-people-to-change-jobs taxes now. Otherwise you are getting people desperate for a job or that aren't skilled enough to land a WFH job. So it's simple: you ask for more, you pay more. We know Schmidt's comment \"Google decided that work life balance and going home early and working from home was more important than winning.\" is just trying to get more out of workers for no additional pay. Convincing people to work harder with words only costs time. But companies aren't doing that. They're going the opposite direction and making return to office a threatening and oppressive response. Then they are also turning around and doing layoffs on top of it. Those who are good can go find a WFH job. None of what the CEOs are doing coincide with what they are saying, and no one trusts them.

This feels like a generalization which isn't true across the age spectrum. I manage two products teams which are on opposite ends of the spectrum. One which has been working for more time than I have (10-20 years) and another which got their first jobs right before the pandemic so most of them have never worked outside hybrid settings. Both teams work on the same complexity and produce similar products (model optimizations mostly). These are not skunk works teams either, they are coming up with new models for lithography machines. These products run on most semiconductor fabs in the world. I observe the younger team is way better than anyone else at remote work. Even the other more senior teams in my department. They are in fact the more social team, sometimes even I can't keep up with their in jokes. I'm not surprised, most of these people grew up with the internet (I had some teenage years without it).

I get that china is a direct economic threat. That’s obvious. I also get that china is a philosophical threat on a level different to the Soviet Union (that was freedom produces more wealth than totalitarianism - which the US won.). The problem with China is that the argument is much harder to win - china is doing well economically (kinda) - and has not given up its totalitarian control. Their argument was the Soviet Union tried central command economics whereas we are something something power of markets and chinese culture. What gets me is that this is not something to win on the battlefield - this is something where we (being liberal democracies) need to double down on liberal democracy- both the production of wealth and the use of that wealth to raise the living standards of all its citizens - in other words if we think freedom is better we make it so fucking obvious we live in utopia it’s painful. Yea that’s wealth taxes, yes it’s more spending on infrastructure and education and sharing the wealth, and teaching ourselves to aspire to better. Not (just) having bigger guns. reply gkanai 11 hours agoparentAs someone who spent 5 years in China pre-pandemic, China is a threat to many nations due to their growth. The Chinese govt. is specifically targeting key markets (EVs, solar, battery tech, steel, semiconductors) and China makes much more of those items that can be used internally in China. So China ends up driving any non-Chinese battery or solar panel manufacturer out of business. If Chinese EVs were to be sold widely in the US, they would be less than half the cost of any Western-made EV and would take over the EV market. A future where Chinese companies own the EV market in the US with all of the American user data going back to servers in China- that's just not a future the US govt. wants- no govt. (outside of China's own) should want that. Then there's the whole Fentanyl epidemic in the US and elsewhere. That is largely due to Chinese chemical manufacturers who are selling the chemicals to Mexico and then those drugs are smuggled into the US. There are many to blame here but the US has been pushing China to ban the sale of these chemicals outside of China for a long time without agreement. China realizes this is important to the US and it's being used as a key trade issue. \"doubling down on liberal democracy\" got us to where we are now wrt China. China doesn't respond to liberal democracy. They only respond to force or trade embargos, or tariffs.

I don't grok why Tesla does it and I don't grok why BYD does it either. What's wrong with the alternative where we allow real competition that benefits everyone, and then ban any features (eg sending data to servers) that the government gets nervous about? I don't see how this is any different from the myriad of other requirements on cars (eg mandated safety belts etc etc etc). I recognize that state-subsidised competition still isn't fair, so I support import tariffs that match those subsidies, but any further and you're just hurting competition and the consumer, right? Thing is, super cheap EVs and solar panels is exactly what we should want. There's a climate crisis going on and these things are a big part of the solution. With climate goggles on, to put import tariffs on the tech that's gonna save the world sound batshit insane.

The drug problems come from the cartels, and from the fact that US's war on drugs makes drugs expensive, and thus profitable. There's no possibility of humans relinquishing drug use - think about the prohibition and the problems that it caused. I say, just allow drugs to be manufactured, and sold (under license and regulation) in the US. It's gonna be like alcohol. This will take away the profits from the cartels, and they will stop buying from china. It will increase tax revenue, as drug consumption can be taxed (like tobacco today is).

The prior three decades were driven by the line of thought that a prosperous economy tends towards democracy and that prosperity prevents war. Allied to this, the expectation was that this would be mutually beneficial with both parties pursuing it in good faith. Since then, it's become clear it's not the case. China have found the loopholes, their lack of IP (intellectual property rights) enforcement and government corporate espionage have shown the relationship is asymmetric and to the detriment of the US. Xi has also strengthened his hold on power dramatically, breaking with his predecessors gradual loosening of control. This leads to more risk of irrational ideological driven decisions such as war, maintaining prosperity is no longer necessarily the main driving factor.

It's perplexing to hear such a deterministic and high-stakes view being expressed in elite circles. I wonder what specific factors or events have led to this conclusion, and whether it's based on concrete evidence or if it's more of a narrative that has gained traction. It would be interesting to understand the reasoning behind this perspective, especially given the complex and multifaceted nature of US-China relations.

There is a line of evidence/thinking that says relations between democracies are a lot more stable. So if you make everyone a democracy there would be no wars and a lot more peace. And peace is what humanity (or each individual) aspires to be. Unfortunately this may result in some degree of intervention or politicking that others may not like. Intervention, specifically, is forcing judgement onto others. Regarding these elites, you could say it's a calling from whatever Christian god that tells them to spread whatever good they deem it to be. But it may just as well be hubris, or human nature - a superiority complex that comes from being at the top of the chain of 'merit' and status. Anyway, it's happened before.

In my opinion, it's not about communist vs democracy, IP theft, ideology, Taiwan, etc. Elites hardly care. These are just the topics used by the government to get common people riled up. The sentiment comes from increasing competition from China in the upper value chain where these elites get their wealth from. These elites want China to manufacture phones for them. They don't want China to design phones and sell it to consumers directly. The same sentiment was found when Japan looked like it was going to take over the world economically. It's a lot easier for the government to get its citizens to become anti-China if they use anti-communist, IP theft, human rights, etc. propaganda. Commoners resonate with these much easier. It's not going to work as well if the government tells you to hate China because they're increasingly more competitive at high value things such as design and services. reply aurareturn 8 hours agorootparentIt’s easy to see why as well. Take Zuckerberg for example. He went in front of congress and spouted as much anti-china rhetoric as he can. He obviously does not want competition from Chinese social media companies such as TikTok. He wants TikTok banned. Meta even admitted that it hired a PR agency to try to connect TikTok to CCP. Take Elon for example. He definitely wants Trump in office because he knows if Chinese EVs ever make it to American shores, Tesla would have fierce competition. Trump wanting massive tariffs on Chinese goods matters little to Elon. Elon doesn’t care if he has to pay $5 for a Chinese good at Walmart instead of $2.50. Only commoners will suffer. But as long as Elon gets extremely high tariffs on Chinese EVs, he’ll be happy. For Schmidt, it’s clear that he has big ownership stakes in American tech companies.

Now, some people may disagree with this on a philosophical level (libertarians for example), but it is what it is. If you now just mass import anything and everything from a country with much lower \"standards\" (I use the term to encompass all of the above and whatever else), then it means your own working population get cheaper stuff, but suffer from the loss of jobs. Not only that, but it creeps into everything. Where once you were high value design, even that starts leaking out of society into a country willing to undercut you on \"standards\".

    "originBody": "One Man’s Quest to Restore the First-Ever Air Force One President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s plane is starting to look like itself again. by Eric J. Wallace August 1, 2024 One Man’s Quest to Restore the First-Ever Air Force One Karl Stoltzfus decided to track down Eisenhower’s original Air Force One after happening upon a local news story about the neglected aircraft on a layover at Tucson International Airport. Staff Sgt. Andrew Lee/001 Images/Alamy It was 1953 and U.S. President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower sat at a big mahogany desk working on a plan to end the Korean War. A small team of elite Washington staffers lounged nearby on mid-century leather sofas or in custom bucket chairs, smoking over hand-carved wood tables. Eisenhower and his team weren’t at the White House, though, or even in D.C.: At that exact moment, they were soaring high over the Pacific Ocean in an overhauled 1948 Lockheed C-121 Constellation aircraft, the first-ever Air Force One. The 100-foot-long and 132-foot-wide, four-propeller plane could hold about 16 passengers, was piloted by a crew of five, and staffed with two or three attendants. Its elegantly tapered fuselage was shaped like a bottlenose dolphin and had thousands of mirror-polished aluminum panels in addition to the hand-painted word “Columbine” arched above a blossoming blue and white flower. ATLAS OBSCURA BOOKS A Visual Odyssey Through the Marvels of Life Venture into Nature's Unseen Realms with Our New Book Atlas Obscura: Wild Life Pre-Order Now “The Constellation was the most iconic of the 1950s airliners, and this one took things to a new level,” says military historian and writer Nicholas A. Veronico. “It was the first plane to go by the call sign, Air Force One, and was heralded as the star of the skies.” Yet, 60 years later, the plane, known as Columbine II, lay neglected and rusting in a field at a rural Arizona airport. That is until aeronautical entrepreneur and aviation history buff Karl Stoltzfus discovered its pedigree and took it upon himself to restore the first Air Force One. President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s plane, Columbine II, was the first to use the Air Force One call sign. Dynamic Aviation Columbine II spent the first five years of its life as a military-issue V.I.P. transport before Eisenhower ordered comprehensive upgrades, named it after the flower of his wife’s home state of Colorado, and made it his presidential plane in 1953. The Federal Aviation Administration adopted the tagline Air Force One a year later after a near-catastrophic incident over Richmond International Airport. The plane’s numerical, military tagline 8610 was identical to that of a commercial airliner seeking to land and confusion among air traffic controllers nearly caused a midair collision. From then on, presidential planes were known as Air Force One. But Columbine II’s significance goes beyond being the first Air Force One: Eisenhower used the plane to usher in a new era of presidential diplomacy. While Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first president to have an official plane, he used it just three times. His successor, Harry Truman, was similarly avoidant. However, Eisenhower was a seasoned pilot and relied heavily on air travel to manage Allied campaigns during World War II. “He saw the potential of a presidential plane as a powerful tool for international and domestic relations,” says Veronico, author of Air Force One: The Aircraft of the Modern U.S. Presidency. Eisenhower traveled across the U.S. and the world to meet with leaders, logging more than 63,000 miles in the first two years of his presidency. He used Columbine II to end the Korean War and wrote his famed “Atoms for Peace” speech onboard. It helped Eisenhower “lay the foundation for how modern presidents conduct foreign diplomacy,” says Veronico. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, his son Major John Eisenhower, and his wife Barbara Eisenhower wave goodbye as they board Air Force One to Hawaii in 1960. Library of Congress/LC-DIG-ppmsca-83216 Columbine II was later repurposed as a V.I.P. transport for Vice President Richard Nixon and visiting dignitaries such as Queen Elizabeth, and Eisenhower converted a newer, larger Lockheed Super Constellation into his next Air Force One in November 1954. Eisenhower flew on Columbine II for the last time in 1959. Then, after a brief stint as a commercial airliner, the plane was retired to an Arizona Air Force storage facility in 1968. How did Columbine II wind up abandoned in the desert? “The short answer is, it got lost,” says Veronico. By 1968, the plane’s presidential paint job and lux accouterments were long gone. That combined with what was likely a clerical error during inventory obscured its predigious pedigree. At a 1970 surplus auction, crop duster and fire bomber Mel Christler bought the former Air Force One in a package of five decommissioned C-121s. “When you find out [a plane] was Eisenhower’s, now you’re stuck with it.” “At that time very few people were thinking about the historical significance of these aircraft, much less how to preserve them,” says Veronico. Columbine II had slipped through the cracks: “By then it was just another number.” Christler pulled parts from the former Air Force One to service his fleet of Constellations until they were retired from use in 1978. He was about to scrap Columbine II when a Smithsonian researcher called with recently unearthed news of its presidential past. Christler—a former WWII pilot and flight instructor—spent the next decade struggling to restore the plane on a shoestring budget. “When you find out [a plane] was Eisenhower’s, now you’re stuck with it,” Christler’s son and business successor, Lockie Christler, told Airman Magazine in 2016. “You have a presidential plane you can’t melt up because people wouldn’t think very highly of you.” Mel Christler got Columbine II back to basic flying condition, hoping the progress would attract a private collector or nonprofit to buy the plane and take over the project. But that didn’t happen. It was parked in an open field at Arizona’s Marana Regional Airport in 2003. Christler died two years later. For years, the first Air Force One sat neglected and forgotten in an open field at Arizona’s Marana Regional Airport. Dynamic Aviation That’s where Karl Stoltzfus, then C.E.O. of the aircraft maintenance company Dynamic Aviation, found the plane 11 years later. He decided to track it down after reading a local news story on a layover at Tucson International Airport. “Storage fees were adding up and the owner threatened to scrap it,” says Stoltzfus. “It was unbearable to think that a priceless piece of American history might be turned into beer cans.” Columbine II was in a sorry state when he and lead mechanic Brian Miklos arrived in 2014 to look at the plane. The plane’s aluminum paneling was totally oxidized. Engine hoses and gaskets had corroded to dust. And the fuselage was infested with rodents, birds, and scorpions. The scope of repairs was so staggering, Miklos took one look and thought, “This is a lost cause, where the heck would you even start?” Then Stoltzfus asked if he could ready it for a cross-country flight to Dynamic’s Bridgewater, Virginia, headquarters. “And I honestly thought he’d gone insane,” says Miklos. But Stoltzfus was dead serious. He bought Columbine II for about $1.5 million in early 2015 and appointed Miklos to lead an onsite repair team in partnership with the Mid America Flight Museum. It took a year and 8,000 hours to get the first Air Force One flight worthy. The herculean effort included tearing down and rebuilding all the engines, replacing thousands of yards of electrical wiring, swapping out every rubber hose and gasket on the entire plane, replacing landing gear, and much more. Columbine II finally made what Miklos describes as a “somewhat scary and extremely precarious” 2,000-plus-mile journey to Bridgewater in 2016, where it would enter the next phase of restoration. It touched down to a crowd of more than 1,000 cheering spectators. In 2016, the plane made a “somewhat scary and extremely precarious” 2,000-plus-mile journey to Bridgewater, Virginia, to undergo a complete restoration. Dynamic Aviation “I admit it was an unconventional—if not impractical—approach,” said Stoltzfus, who flew behind Columbine II in a vintage chase plane. “But when a champion boxer loses a fight, which is more dignified: Getting carried out on a stretcher, or walking away on your own two legs?” Today, Columbine II sits in a cavernous hangar alongside other historic military aircraft in various stages of repair. A small team of dedicated volunteers and staffers has worked steadily on the restoration since 2016. Dynamic spends about $500,000 a year on the project—and created the nonprofit First Air Force One in 2022 to oversee its completion. “This is complicated, costly, and time-consuming work that requires tremendous expertise and ingenuity,” says First Air Force One executive director Phil Douglas, an aerospace engineer who inherited the project after Stoltzfus passed away unexpectedly in December 2020. A research team collected rare reference photographs, schematic drawings, and blueprints replete with color codes and information about original materials. Still, Lockheed built just 332 models of the C-121s and the plane is nearly 80 years old. Salvaged units are virtually nonexistent and there are no catalogs for ordering even basic parts. That means workers have to fabricate or modify new or salvaged components to look like originals. “It’s forced us to really think outside-the-box and get creative,” says the project’s lead mechanic Bill Borchers, who’s spent more than 15,000 hours on the plane so far. “I can tell you there’s a lot of custom machining going on around here.” Since 2016, a dedicated team of volunteers and staff have worked steadily on Columbine II’s restoration. Dynamic Aviation Then there were the safety upgrades. Every inch of the interior had to be dismantled to replace a skeleton of rotted wood paneling. Miles of old electrical wire were stripped out and upgraded. A hidden panel of contemporary flight gauges was added to the cockpit and an array of sensors was installed in the engines. Aesthetics were equally demanding. Thousands of oxidized aluminum panels were laboriously polished with special chemicals until they shined like mirrors. Borchers found new-old-stock paint for an artist to touch up hand-painted exterior art and lettering. Smaller than standard, wood-backed swivel chairs were sourced from a Dassault Falcon jet—and are slated to be reshaped and upholstered with vintage leather by a master craftsman. The latter will also build authentic replica furniture like side, buffet, and coffee tables, cabin molding, mid-century couches, fold-out beds, and Ike’s mahogany desk. “At this point, we’re close to moving out of the nuts-and-bolts phase and into the more exciting decorative stuff,” says Douglas, who estimates the project will cost another $12 million and, assuming that funding is secured, take about three years to complete. “When it’s all said and done, Columbine II will look exactly as it did during Eisenhower’s presidency.” Douglas hopes to partner with a major corporate sponsor to expedite completion and eventually fund appearances at air shows around the country and globe, where the plane will be open for public tours. “Karl believed Columbine II could serve as a powerful symbol that reached across generations and reminded us of where we came from and what we stand for,” says Douglas. “It was his dream to bring this plane back to life and we’re determined to make that happen.” Slowly but surely, the plane is starting to look like itself again.

It’s fully stocked, with meeting rooms and communication equipment and all. My favorite part is the fake temperature control: > President Johnson was finicky about room temperature and when he was VP and developed a habit of haranguing the flight crew about lowering or raising the cabin temperature. After a while the crew got tired of his shenanigans, so they installed a “fake” temperature control in the Conference Room. This appeasement was successful, and Johnson was so pleased with manipulating the controls himself that he didn’t even notice when the temperature remained the same. https://blog.museumofflight.org/quirks-of-the-first-jet-powe... reply rtkwe 20 hours agoparentThe Airforce Museum in Ohio also has a few different early Air Force Ones including at least one you can walk through. https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Pres... reply kayodelycaon 18 hours agorootparentI’m pretty there are two you can walk through.

They are destroyed in a series of tests of the vehicle's countermeasures and protective devices against an array of potential weapon systems, boom boom kaboom.

Most of the aviation industry would love to get rid of the burden that is leaded avgas. Not to mention the environmentalists, health departments etc. The problem is just that the rules for larger aircraft apply to general aviation too. And the margins there aren't high enough to pay for all the certification. So we're stuck with 1950s tech which would never pass certification today but did at one time in history.

But yeah, I would hope they plan to do more with it than that... I don't think they should try to turn this into a profit-seeking enterprise, but with the cost of the restoration probably pushing $20M (enough to buy a brand-new, modern jet of similar size, I'd bet), it might be nice to recoup some of that. reply j33zusjuice 5 hours agorootparent$20M is not even close to the cost of a new jet. Jets are insanely expensive. Idk whether jets are best measured by dimensions or capacity, but a jet with a similar wingspan is a 737-800, and those cost like $106,000,000. If we’re going by capacity (I’m using seating-capacity because it’s easier to find than volume measurements), a G550 sits up to 19 (depending on the configuration: most rentals I saw list up to 16 passengers), and retails at $62,000,000.

Words can mean multiple things, and can get attached to adjacent things. It helps that US has been using the same two VC-25 since 1990. reply fsckboy 16 hours agorootparentI acknowledged what Air Force One was referring to in this discussion and in the article, did you miss that? then I added some information. now I'll add some more, both from wikipedia: Marine One is the call sign of any United States Marine Corps aircraft carrying the president of the United States. It usually denotes a helicopter operated by Marine Helicopter Squadron One \"Nighthawks\", consisting of either the large Sikorsky VH-3D Sea King or the newer, smaller VH-60N \"White Hawk\" Air Force Two is the air traffic control designated call sign held by any United States Air Force aircraft carrying the vice president of the United States, but not the president. The term is often associated with the Boeing C-32, a modified 757 which is most commonly used as the vice president's transport. I always try to add information or clarification, knowledge is power. reply kelnos 14 hours agorootparentI get what you were going for here, but I think to some it might have come across as unimportant pedantry. Perhaps phrasing your initial comment as \"Fun fact: the call sign...\" would have been better received? I dunno, people are fickle sometimes. reply j33zusjuice 5 hours agorootparentprevYou acknowledged that we were discussing specific planes, but did not acknowledge the use of “Air Force One” as valid for discussing a specific aircraft (as shorthand for, “the plane most commonly used for presidential flights, and therefore, most commonly assigned the call-sign ‘Air Force One’”). Maybe that’s what you intended to do, but that is not clear in your original phrasing, which, to me, seemed more like a correction than an addition.

    "originBody": "Aristotle — How to live a good life Publish Date28. February 202416315 Views 2400 years ago Aristotle found out how to be happy. His Nicomachean Ethics is an operating manual for a good life: What is good? First of all, what makes a thing a good thing? A good thing fulfils its unique function. A good knife is a knife that is good at cutting. A good eye is an eye that is good at seeing. Now, what makes a good human? To know what a human should be good at, we need to look at what is unique about humans: We have a soul that thinks and feels. So for us to live a good life means to have an excellent soul. And this excellence reveals itself in a clear intellect and a noble character. Let’s have a closer look at both and how we can achieve them: 1. The virtues of a clear intellect Today, we often reduce all our mental abilities to “intelligence”. Aristotle went a bit deeper and identified multiple theoretical virtues: Art (techne) is the ability to make things. Intelligence (nous) is intuitive insight into underlying truths of our world. Scientific knowledge (episteme) is our logical reasoning about the world. Prudence (phronesis) is our ability to make practical (moral) decisions. Wisdom (sophia) is a comprehensive understanding of deeper truths. These theoretical virtues help us understand what is true and possible. And as important as they are, for Aristotle something else is just as vital for a good life: our character. 2. The virtues of a noble character A good character can handle emotions properly. We do that by finding the right mean between two extremes: Courage is the right mean between cowardice and recklessness. Temperance is the right mean between gluttony and abstinence. This right mean depends on the person. An athlete might need more food than an office worker. It also depends on the situation. Sometimes it is better to avoid conflict, at other times it is worth it to stand our ground. We cannot study rules for proper behaviour. Instead, we must train our character through habituation to find the right mean appropriate to the circumstances. Action! In a successful life, the human soul fulfils its purpose through virtuous actions. Are we born with those virtues? No. Aristotle says that humans have a capacity to be good, but it is up to us to develop our character. This is best achieved through study and habit. Excellence is not something you are, but something you do! A good life… For Aristotle happiness is achieved through a lifetime of virtuous activity of the soul, involving both intellect and character. So far so good, you might say—but isn’t happiness about feeling good? … is a happy life Aristotle does not deny that pleasure is fun. Money, fame and food are great and contribute to our happiness! But these things are not essential to a good life. One might even suffer greatly and still live a virtuous—that is: a good—life. When Aristotle speaks of a “happy” life, he means a fulfilled or flourishing life rather than a pleasurable one. Such a virtuous life helps us find our place in the world. It is good simply because it suits our nature. Everything we do should ultimately serve the best we can be: a human soul with a clear intellect and a noble character. Happiness is not a feeling of pleasure. Happiness is the pursuit of excellence.

When Aristotle speaks of a “happy” life, he means a fulfilled or flourishing life rather than a pleasurable one.” Suffering certainly does make it harder to be virtuous, but you can interpret that not as disregarding the poor but as giving even more justification for orienting society toward satisfying everyone’s basic needs. reply Xen9 2 hours agorootparentIdea: Web page of every phrase in (Koine) greek that meant different thing to the ancient great philosophers than in English language today.

However, his financial conditions and the fame that his life's work brought him seem to have had the opposite effect of what you suggested. There is a painting by Rembrandt that represents exactly this. The painting depicts Aristotle with one hand holding a chain of gold and the other hand resting on a bust of Homer.

But to get the order right, this presentation needs some background in the Greek terms Aristotle is using. E.g., focus on the first few lines of the Nichomachean Ethics, about all beings having a good for themselves; that pulls in his metaphysics, some logic, and orients you to the argument structure.

There’s a lot of wisdom in Aristotle even if you don’t accept his entire system. For example, in his politics he says mechanics are not capable of practicing virtue. An interesting claim! reply geye1234 4 hours agoparentHe may well mean a mechanic qua mechanic is not capable or practising virtue -- not a mechanic qua human being. The ancients tended to predicate formally where we predicate materially. When they said 'a mechanic can't practise virtue', they didn't mean every man who is a mechanic, which is what we would mean.

Of course, a good knife is a knife that cuts well. But what does it mean to cut well? Just the sharpness of the blade? What about grip comfort? And balancing? And stickiness? And weight? And what about the thing being cut? Can a knife cut everything well? As you can see, we are already dead in our tracks, as asking what makes a knife good is basically on the same level of complexity of asking the same thing about a human, and this is why ancient philosophers, many of whom didn't really explore nuance, should be critically studied, without falling for simplistic \"this is my hero\" behavior reply Asymo 6 hours agoparentActually, your analysis only seems to make sense because you ignored the beginning of the explanation. I'll rephrase it here in other words: \"Man's good can only consist in the 'work' that is peculiar to him, that is, the work that he and only he knows how to perform, just as, in general, the good of each thing consists in the work that is peculiar to that thing. The work of the eye is to see, the work of the ear is to hear, and so on.\" So, it becomes obvious that making an analysis based on the universal concept of \"knife\" and judging it by its ability to literally cut anything is absurd. The more accurate approach would be to judge a \"kitchen knife\" by its ability to help in cooking tasks, and we can be even more specific by talking about knives for bread, meat, tomatoes, etc. And I find it quite strange to question \"what does it mean to cut well?\" If I give you a dull blade and a sharp one for a specific task, you'll know exactly which one cuts well reply throw0101d 6 hours agoparentprev> But what does it mean to cut well?

An interesting criticism considering Aristotle elevated soldiers at war as a prime example. Greek philosophy was generally done by and for noble men, who were expected to deal with war on a regular basis and often actively participate in it. > Aristotle's golden mean (or Temperance) does not account for this. Aristotle gives the example that soldiers should be temperate in their enjoyment of war, not reveling in the bloodshed or pushing farther than they can handle. Work and studies are the same way: regardless of your age the human body has limits that you need to account for. When you're younger you can push past some of the softer limits (stay up late, go without food, etc) but eventually you will hit hard physical limits that, if not respected, will cause irreversible damage and often put you in a worse spot than you started. > \"But Wisdom would say that this is acceptable to sacrifice health at points\" Does it? How do you weight these virtues as one better than another? To directly answer: Aristotle does say Practical Wisdom (or Prudence) is the highest of the cardinal virtues, and that the cardinal virtues of Prudence,Courage,Temperance, and Justice are more important virtues than others. But that's also sort of the whole point of his ethics, you don't have specific rulings of what to do, you develop the character to make the right decisions for the given circumstance. In this case, you rely on good Practical Wisdom to determine what the moderate amount of work is: a wise person wouldn't slack off at work but also wouldn't work 80 hour weeks at the expense of seeing their family. > Calling for some perfect Platonic form that answers all these questions correctly is a bit of a cop-out.

Happiness in English often maps to a transient & discrete emotional state, whereas eudaimonia is a much more expansive conception of flourishing and fulfillment that is not as simply as \"feeling\" happy or joyful all the time. Indeed, in virtue ethics, it is sometimes possible to endure hardship and feel quite negative emotions while experience eudaimonia (at least in the Stoic version of this branch of philosophy). reply hasbot 5 hours agorootparentFully defining terms (i.e. eudaimonia) for a modern audience is essential. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia reply geye1234 5 hours agoparentprevPrudence is the virtue that allows us to see what to do in the infinite and unique situations that present themselves to us each day.

This can be something as trivial as saying \"I choose to forego the pleasure of this ice cream for the sake of my health\", or something as life-changing as \"I choose to give up this career because it's making me unhealthy.\" The good choice is always what leads to 'happiness', which is perhaps better translated as beatitude or fulfillment. Sometimes choice this will result in a feeling of sadness. This is not opposed to 'happiness'/fulfillment/beatitude as Aristotle means it, which is not a feeling.

Fulfillment is, after all, defined by our nature; it is a matter of proceeding from potential to actuality, as determined by our nature. What is good advances a person according to one's nature (in our case, human nature), what is bad acts against it. Telos, or finality, also gives morality its proper and objective ground: what is morally right or wrong follows, ultimately, from one's nature. Since we are humans, we are therefore persons, which is to say animals who can understand their actions and choose between apprehended alternatives, and therefore moral agents. We must therefore choose to act in accord with our nature as free and rational agents, which is to say according to right reason. Our rationality allows us to tackle the question of what it means to be human and to therefore determine what is good. A tragedy of the crudeness of materialism is that it obliterates telos, and in doing so, destroys the only possible objective ground for morality and the good. Married to philosophical liberalism, morality becomes a mystery cult rooted in desire that evades explanation. Yyou cannot square the existence of desires--which can be good or bad, in accord with reason, or deviant or depraved--with a purely materialist universe; even Descartes had to tack on the disembodied ghost of the Cartesian mind to account for all sorts of phenomena. So you end up with an irrational gnosticism as a result. But the fact of the matter is that even the most mundane varieties of efficient causality presuppose telos, as telos is not the same as conscious intent (which is a particular variety), but fundamentally, the ordering of a cause toward an effect. The only reason efficient causality is intelligible at all is because the relation between cause is ordered toward an effect by virtue of the nature of the thing, and not arbitrarily related. Striking a match predictably results in fire, not nothing, nor the appearance of the Titanic or whatever. We are seeing an increased, if modest interest in broadly Aristotelian thought (which some refer to as \"Neo-Aristotelian\"), however. As the materialist dinosaurs pass from this earth, fresh blood is willing to reexamine the nihilistic, dehumanizing, materialist dogmas of the last two or three centuries. It was never the case that materialism overthrew the prior intellectual tradition by discrediting it. Rather, it began with the perilous decision to \"start from scratch\". Putting aside the dubiousness of the notion, what we can expect from starting from scratch is a repetition of the same errors. There are eerie similarities between modern ideas and the pre-Socratic philosophers, for example, of which Aristotle was very much aware and to which he was responding. reply petsfed 2 hours agoparentOne of my core criticisms to Plato and later Aristotle is not a criticism of Aristotle qua Aristotle, but in the way people give this almost religious reverence to the particular words they use. As if by saying that >Telos, or finality, also gives morality its proper and objective ground: what is morally right or wrong follows, ultimately, from one's nature. I have some intuitive understanding of what telos is and why it matters. If I'm understanding you correctly, morality is defined by outcome, but the \"tragedy of the crudeness of materialism\" is that we can't know the final outcome of anything. Then what good is knowing about telos anyway? I'd argue that Scholasticism, that is, the marriage of Middle-Ages Christianity to the truthy-sounding gobbledygook of Aristotle, set the case for the moral authority of the church back a thousand years. reply z3t4 10 hours agoprevMy empirical study of happy people comes down to these three points: * Have low expectations * Enjoy simple things * Don't care too much reply xelxebar 8 hours agoparentIs a happy life a good life?

In particular, as we get older I think we also get more skillful at handling our own internal and external conditions to create a comfortable-like happiness.

Well made plans and expertly crafted systems of comfort also function as barriers between you and the larger world in a sense. Is that desirable?

Even that I've seen examples, but I agree its much rarer. reply pavlovsgods 10 hours agoparentprevMay we stand judged by our own actions and words and not by SEO posts portraying them :p Aristotle is well worth reading for someone interested in philosophy, but he himself did not claim to have discovered how to be happy (he thought of himself as explicating and systematizing what everyone thinks about happiness), his notion of telos (poorly translated as 'function') is not subject to your rightly raised objection, and, though he did believe that humans are distinguished from non-human animals by possession of a rational faculty, he thought we shared with non-human animals the capacity to feel. reply simonmysun 9 hours agoprev [–] Aristotle lives in the old versions of the Earth. The outdated concepts may not stand up to modern thinking, but are sufficient for dealing with a simple life. Unfortunately, most people's lives are not simple. reply marginalia_nu 9 hours agoparentI think in many parts most people's lives are not simple because they engage with them through muddled and complex intellectual frameworks using 16 letter words to explain 3-5 letter word concepts. You'd be surprised how much modern life begins to make sense viewed through the framework of antique philosophy. reply sesm 6 hours agorootparentFor example, our concept of 'work most of your time to afford food and place to live' for Aristotle would translate to a single word 'slave'. Good for him that he didn't have to do it and had slaves working for him instead. reply bluetomcat 9 hours agorootparentprevAncient societies were different. A male citizen from the aristocracy could lead a slow leisurely life, gathering with like-minded citizens on the agora and talking for hours, enjoying the finer things in life like wine and sporadic sexual contacts, taking part in sports competitions. The \"ancient wisdom\" we consume now is coming from that segment of the Greek and Roman societies. reply marginalia_nu 9 hours agorootparentI don't think that invalidates their conclusions. There's also Epictetus. That man can hardly be accused of being a spoiled aristocrat. reply bluetomcat 8 hours agorootparentIt discredits them. Imagine the modern version – a privileged upper-middle class person with an expensive upbringing and education talking about stoicism ala Ryan Holiday and hard work. Their version of stoicism is most likely about not worrying of the fluctuations of stock values. An economically disenfranchised man's stoicism is about seeing their health degrade. reply marginalia_nu 8 hours agorootparentI don't think this is a useful mindset. We judge ideas based on their merits, not who came up with them. You can throw these accusations at modern figures like Marx and Engels as well. They were very much coddled and wealthy, far removed from the workaday concerns of everyday life. Interesting ideas are disproportionately likely to come from people who have a lot of leisure time, as that is a prerequisite for having the time to think about anything. reply simonmysun 9 hours agorootparentprevWe are forced to make our life complex. You can't deny the fact that the society we are living in has evolved. Of course one still has the oppurtunity to get rid of it and live in a cave, but how many people are doing this? reply bigstrat2003 9 hours agorootparent> We are forced to make our life complex. No we aren't. People choose (or not) to make their lives complex, it isn't forced upon them. reply simonmysun 9 hours agorootparentI'm glad you have a choice. I might also be able to choose not to, but there are more people who can't. reply marginalia_nu 9 hours agorootparentprevIn what sense is it more complex? reply bluetomcat 9 hours agorootparentYou are born into a society with certain expectations and customs. Choosing the slow and simple path turns you into a social recluse with little opportunities for contacts and further development. You may be reading Plato and Aristotle and have no idea what's currently happening in your neighbourhood because of lack of social contacts. The path to transformation should be the collective consensus towards new visions of society, not some individual acts of virtue signalling. reply marginalia_nu 9 hours agorootparent> You are born into a society with certain expectations and customs. Choosing the slow and simple path turns you into a social recluse with little opportunities for contacts and further development. You may be reading Plato and Aristotle and have no idea what's currently happening in your neighbourhood because of lack of social contacts. Why do you think engaging with Plato and Aristotle will make you a recluse? > The path to transformation should be the collective consensus towards new visions of society, You use a should statement. Why should it be this way? Who has decided this is the way it should be? Also why does there need to be transformation? > not some individual acts of virtue signalling. Virtue ethics is also not the same as virtue signalling. Virtues in virtue ethics are for your own benefit. It's even a common point to do good things and not tell other people in e.g. stoic and early christian thought, as doing things to raise your esteem in the eyes of others is prideful and not virtuous. reply simonmysun 9 hours agorootparentprev> In what sense is it more complex? The life is more complex because of the muddled and complex intellectual frameworks. This is because the 3-5 letter word concepts need to be defined to make sure everybody is talking about the same thing when people have to interact with more people. reply marginalia_nu 9 hours agorootparentI don't think how you choose to describe the things that are change their nature. reply simonmysun 8 hours agorootparentYes but it affects how other people comprehense it. Imagine making laws based on the idea of virtue from Aristotle. reply marginalia_nu 8 hours agorootparentI'm imagining. Then what would happen? reply simonmysun 8 hours agorootparentYou will need a percise definition of virtue and end up using the muddled complex intellectual frameworks. You may have no problem understanding the virtue concept with simple words because you grew up with it, but people with different environments may understand a different thing. reply svieira 6 hours agorootparentThey may, but the wonderful thing about discourse is that in most cases you don't need to rebuild everything from raw signals processing on up. You just need to find the first common layer of agreement and build from there. reply WJW 9 hours agoparentprevI think Aristotle would be of the opinion that most people's lives could in fact be quite simple, but many choose to complicate because it makes them feel important, because they are confused about what they want out of life, or both. reply fasteo 9 hours agoparentprev [–] >>> The outdated concepts may not stand up to modern thinking Can you elaborate ?

According to Browser Task Manager, the tab is consuming 657MB compared to 25-70MB most other tabs are using. reply apwheele 4 hours agorootparentYes this is part of the price of running it client side instead of having a server do all the data manipulation.

[0]: https://www.monodevelop.com/ reply neonsunset 47 minutes agorootparentVS4Mac is MonoDevelop. Well, it was - VS4Mac is dead now as it has been stagnating, and at the end of its life was likely more harmful to .NET adoption by developers using macOS. Its niche is now replaced by VS Code, particularly after base C# extension switched to Roslyn LSP from Omnisharp, and, of course, Rider which has been a strong cross-platform offering for a long time. With that said, I heard only positive things about MonoDevelop back in the day and my impression from the feedback is that it was something its authors really put care into. I suppose it is part of history now. On Blazor - both Rider and VS Code support it. Contrary to the belief of slowly but surely diminishing group of developers that think .NET is still stuck in Windows land, there is nothing that ties you to Windows here. reply giancarlostoro 1 hour agorootparentprevOne of the best IDE's I've ever used.

I tinkered a bit to try it myself. Turns out you can throw this into your website and it will display \"Hello World\": import js js.document.querySelector(\"body\").innerText = \"Hello World\" So it seems to be a script that looks for scripts of type \"py\" and transpiles them from Python to JavaScript via Pyodide?

    "originBody": "ImRAD ImRAD is a GUI builder for the ImGui library. It generates and parses C++ code which can be directly used in your application. ImRAD runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS. Features ImRAD is under active development but these are the main features: supports designing all kinds of windows Floating windows, popups and modal popups. These are ImGui backend independent MainWindow with GLFW integration. ImRAD generates GLFW calls which will synchronize ImGui window with its OS window (title bar, resizability flags, autosize etc.) Activity. This is a undecorated window which fills the entire viewport area. Only one activity can be shown at the time. Used mainly for Android apps contains a GLFW template for generating generic main.cpp contains an android template for generating generic MainActivity.java+manifest+main.cpp supports wide range of widgets basic widgets like Text, Checkbox, Combo, Button, Slider, ColorEdit etc. container widgets like Child, Table, CollapsingHeader, TreeNode, TabBar, more exotic widgets such as Splitter MenuBar and context menu editing CustomWidget (a placeholder to user code) generates layout using SameLine/Spacing/NextColumn instead of absolute positioning this ensures widgets respect item spacing and frame padding in a consistent way there is a clear relationship between parent - child widget as well as children ordering which is important for container widgets like Table overlay widgets can be placed on top using relative position to the nearest window corner supports box layout powerful and simple to use layout mechanism implemented on top of ImGui functionality stretch any sizeable widget in horizontal or vertical direction insert spacers to achieve alignment alternatively you can use Table Layout Helper to generate horizontal layout using invisible Table supports property binding class variables can be managed through simple class wizard or from binding dialog property binding is important because ImGui is immediate mode GUI library so widget states like input text or combobox items must be set at the time of drawing from within the generated code. using property binding generated UI becomes dynamic and yet it can still be designed at the same time supports generating event handlers and other support code for example modal dialog will generate OpenPopup member function with a lambda callback called when dialog is closed event handlers allow event handling user code to be separated from the generated part so the designer still works generated code is delimited by comment markers and user is free to add additional code around and continue to use ImRAD at the same time this can be used to call dependent popup Draw calls or to calculate some variables it is also possible to use CustomWidget which will just call to a user code callback target window style is fully configurable apart from default styles provided by ImGui user can define new style and save it as an INI file under the style folder. Colors, style variables and used fonts can all be configured. ImRAD will follow style settings when designing your UI stored style can be loaded in your app by using simple imrad.h function generated code is ready to use in your project and depends only on ImGui library and one accompanying header file (imrad.h) some features such as MainWindow or Image widget require GLFW dependency. Compile your code with IMRAD_WITH_GLFW to activate it currently Image widget requires stb library as well. Compile your code with IMRAD_WITH_STB or supply your own LoadTextureFromFile() optional support for the popular fmt library can be activated by defining IMRAD_WITH_FMT. This will allow you to use formating flags throughout all string properties ImRAD tracks changes to the opened files so files can be designed in ImRAD and edited in your IDE of choice at the same time maybe the auto-save feature would be useful to have License ImRAD source code is licensed under the GPL license Any code generated by the tool is excluded from GPL and can be included in any project either open-source or commercial and it's up to the user to decide the license for it. Additionally since imrad.h is used by the generated code it is also excluded from the GPL license Download binaries for up-to date version clone & build the repository using CMake.

It would seem so. Their hand-rolled parser handles only a subset of the language. E.g. it hard-codes recognition for stl containers, and presumably only the ones that it might emit in generated code. There's no AST built, at least not at this level. It tokenizes and lexes, and seems to leave it up to the caller to understand how to pump the parsing \"state machine\".

It might be my Visual Basic nostalgia kicking in, but this is the icing on the imgui cake for me. reply 29athrowaway 15 hours agoparentTo this date there's no RAD experience faster than Visual Basic 6. reply dlachausse 14 hours agorootparentLazarus is pretty close and it’s cross platform. https://www.lazarus-ide.org/ It’s Pascal instead of BASIC, which may or may not be an improvement depending on your perspective. reply badsectoracula 14 hours agorootparentI think \"pretty close\" is severely underselling Lazarus - it is way ahead of Visual Basic 6 in almost every aspect when it comes to making GUIs. Even Delphi 2 (the first 32bit Delphi) allowed for more complex GUIs compared to VB6, let alone something way more advanced like Lazarus. The only thing that VB up to 6 had that you can't find in Lazarus (or Delphi for that matter) is being able to pause the program while it is running (or some error occurred), modify it and continue the execution without restarting it. But overall considering all the pros Lazarus has compared to VB6 i'd say it is much better than VB6 ever was. reply stavros 8 hours agorootparentLazarus seems amazing, and I'd love to write some software with it, but I can't get past the language. You generally do want to pick languages with a big ecosystem, as everything you might want will have already been written. The difference between Python and Delphi isn't a bit more work, it's often the difference between \"there's a library so I can make my thing\" and \"it would take way too long\". reply badsectoracula 2 hours agorootparentYou can interface with existing libraries if you really want, you need to somehow expose a C ABI (be it via the library written in C, exposing an official C ABI or you writing a C bridge). There is a 3rd party \"Python-for-Lazarus\" bridge[0] though for simple stuff you can use the python library directly: program foo; {$MODE OBJFPC} uses CTypes; const PyLib = 'python3.11'; procedure Py_Initialize; cdecl; external PyLib; function PyRun_SimpleString(Command: PChar): CInt; cdecl; external PyLib; begin Py_Initialize; PyRun_SimpleString( 'from tkinter import *'#13 + 'window = Tk()'#13 + 'window.title(\"Hello, world!\")'#13 + 'button = Button(window, text=\"Clicky\")'#13 + 'button.grid()'#13 + 'window.mainloop()'); end. The above uses the Tk library that comes with Python. Also depending on what you want to do chances are there is already a Free Pascal library or existing bindings to a library written in another language. If not, if the library has a C header file you can use the h2pas utility that comes with FPC to make your own (though the generated code does need some modifications to work more often than not). Of course all the above do assume you have knowledge of both Free Pascal and whatever you want to interface with, but at least as far as being able to access existing libraries is concerned, it should be possible - just with some hoops (and at that point it depends on how much you value whatever Lazarus provides over the effort involved in whatever library you want to use). EDIT: and truth be told IMO the biggest roadblock with Lazarus isn't so much the language but that it is just not easy to learn most of that stuff (the core language and runtime library is decently documented but anything outside of that can be a hit and miss) and you basically need an almost arrogant attitude of \"this is just dumb code, not magic, if it is technically possible i can figure out myself how to do it\" :-P. [0] https://github.com/Alexey-T/Python-for-Lazarus reply doublerabbit 4 hours agorootparentprevPascal is a workhorse and to tame the horse takes a lot of skill and blind knowledge. And then when tamed, your horse is the best at the show. I can't fault Pascal.

Pascal syntax is off-putting for many I write my \"app\" as a library (.dll/.so) in C and use Lazarus to do the GUI, because FFI from FreePascal to C (and back again, for callbacks) is almost transparent. reply zerr 8 hours agorootparentWell, I like using C++ for UI. reply badsectoracula 2 hours agorootparentprevIt'd be neat but that would require a ton of effort and cooperation by several different projects. Basically you'd need a C++ compiler to implement the C++ extensions used by C++ Builder (or something similar if you don't care about C++ Builder compatibility) so that C++ code can use Object Pascal methods with the extra functionality it adds (most important being properties and \"published\" sections in class declarations that are exposed via RTTI). You'd also need some tool to create C++ bindings for all the Free Pascal units. The above will make possible to use LCL from C++, though only via code. To get the full RAD deal you'd need to implement a C++ parser (including the extensions mentioned above) and refactoring support for Lazarus' CodeTools equivalent to the existing Free Pascal parser/refactoring so that the IDE can autogenerate code (Lazarus doesn't generate separate source code files like some other IDEs with GUI designers do, instead it updates the same source code you are editing on the fly as it keeps a full AST in memory for all edited files and units they depend on - something like that would be needed for C++ too). And yeah, you'd need the people involved with all the above (really mainly the C++ compiler developers) to play along without breaking stuff. reply scrlk 9 hours agorootparentprevGiven that Python appears to be the new VB6/VBA (in terms of adoption by a non-SWE user base), IMO there's still a gap for a decent VB6-like RAD experience within the Python ecosystem. Qt Designer exists, but PyQt/PySide licencing can cause headaches. reply WillAdams 6 hours agorootparentI'd give a lot for there to be a simple tool for Python which: - had an interactive tool for laying out a GUI - integrated that layout into the code in a meaningful fashion - allowed distributing a project as a single file which could be easily run (say by downloading/installing a single run-time module) The problem is, for each computer I use I need to keep track of which Python environment(s) have been installed where, (and uninstall them) or I end up with something like: https://xkcd.com/1987/ (well, at least something which won't allow me to get a new project installed). reply pjmlp 12 hours agorootparentprevDelphi, C++ Builder, WinForms. reply nottorp 3 hours agorootparentprev... or a more full featured experience than Delphi. VB fails (or used to, haven't worked with it in a looong time) when you want to do custom controls and integrate them in the UI builder. With Delphi that used to be piss easy, you could even write designer-only methods that helped with custom configuring your controls, while with VB you had to do it in something else iirc. Too bad Embarcadero only wants to sell to enterprises that are stuck on legacy applications. And what's with all the Pascal hate? Missing yourand {}? Nothing wrong with begin and end.

Why are people even mentioning VB6 and Delphi then in the comment threads? Possibly because they made the same assumption that I made :) reply kragen 20 minutes agorootparentimgui is a general approach to designing gui libraries proposed by casey muratori in 02005 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1qyvQsjK5Y; the particular library in question is omar cornut's 'dear imgui' a gui that would use 100% of cpu on an 0.52-mips mac 512 https://netlib.org/performance/html/dhrystone.data.col0.html would probably use about 0.02% of cpu on one 2201-mips core of a raspberry pi 3 https://netlib.org/performance/html/dhrystone.data.col0.html if you pessimistically multiply that by 32 to account for having 32 bits per pixel instead of 1, and by 12 to account for 1920×1080 instead of 512×342, it comes to 9%. of one of the cores! also it would run in 0.5% of the pi's ram so, to a significant extent, the struggle is no longer to get something approximating your desired user interface running, but to imagine a user interface that's worth people's time to use. so it makes sense to trade off cpu consumption and ram usage for faster experimentation in a lot of cases reply varispeed 9 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft WPF was great as well.

If someone says \"I made a thing,\" and a reply says \"that's cool but I would rather have something slightly different that matches my technology of choice,\" I can't see any positive outcomes for anybody. For the submitter or author, the message is \"what you made isn't good enough.\" For a reader without context, it purely muddies the waters because it adds noise without teaching them anything. For a reader with context, it's not new. I don't understand what the value could be for anyone. Imagine someone submits an article about a MySQL ORM for Go, and the top comment is \"now one in Ruby, please.\" How does that help anyone? It only diminishes the efforts of the submitter and ignores the complexity of writing an ORM in the first place. If you want to start an effort to do something similar, then talk about doing that. If you want to tell people about another cool technology, do that. If you think the project under discussion could be extended to support something you want, pitch the value. If you want to make a feature request, you can definitely do that with more kindness for the creator. I know from experience how annoying it is when random people come at you with tone critiques to your hastily written HN comments, so please take this as intended, just an attempt at building empathy. reply timschmidt 12 hours agorootparentI think I fired off that comment too quickly, on too little sleep, and it should have been more like \"This is great!

Aging is a key risk factor because, as we grow older, our brain's ability to remove toxic buildup slows down. However, new research in mice demonstrates that it's possible to reverse age-related effects and restore the brain's waste-clearing process.\"This research shows that restoring cervical lymph vessel function can substantially rescue the slower removal of waste from the brain associated with age,\" said Douglas Kelley, PhD, a professor of Mechanical Engineering in the University of Rochester Hajim School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. \"Moreover, this was accomplished with a drug already being used clinically, offering a potential treatment strategy.\" Kelley is one of the lead authors of the study, which appears in the journal Nature Aging, along with Maiken Nedergaard, MD, DMSc, co-director the University's Center for Translational Neuromedicine. First described by Nedergaard and her colleagues in 2012, the glymphatic system is the brain's unique waste removal process that uses cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to wash away excess proteins generated by energy hungry neurons and other cells in the brain during normal activity. This discovery pointed the way for potential new approaches to treat diseases commonly associated with the accumulation of protein waste in the brain, such Alzheimer's (beta amyloid and tau) and Parkinson's (alpha-synuclein). In healthy and young brains, the glymphatic system does a good job of flushing away these toxic proteins, however, as we age, this system slows, setting the stage for these diseases. A network of tiny pumps draws waste from the brain Once laden with protein waste, CSF in the skull needs to make its way to the lymphatic system and ultimately the kidneys, where it is processed along with the body's other waste. The new research combines advanced imaging and particle tracking techniques to describe for the first time in detail the route via the cervical lymph vessels in the neck through which half of dirty CSF exits the brain. In addition to measuring the flow of CSF, the researchers were able observe and record the pulsing of lymph vessels in the neck that helps draw CSF out of the brain. \"Unlike the cardiovascular system which has one big pump, the heart, fluid in the lymphatic system is instead transported by a network of tiny pumps,\" said Kelley. These microscopic pumps, called lymphangions, have valves to prevent backflow and are strung together, one after another, to form lymph vessels. The researchers found that as the mice aged, the frequency of contractions decreased, and the valves failed. As a result, the speed of dirty CSF flowing out of the brains of older mice was 63 percent slower compared to younger animals.Known drug restarts flow of brain cleaning fluidsThe team then set out to see if they could revive the lymphangions and identified a drug called prostaglandin F2&alpha;, a hormone-like compound commonly used medically to induce labor and known to aid smooth muscle contraction. The lymphangions are lined with smooth muscle cells, and when the researchers applied the drug to the cervical lymph vessels in older mice, the frequency of contractions and the flow of dirty CSF from the brain both increased, returning to a level of efficiency found in younger mice. \"These vessels are conveniently located near the surface of the skin, we know they are important, and we now know how to accelerate function,\" said Kelley. \"One can see how this approach, perhaps combined with other interventions, could be the basis for future therapies for these diseases.\" Additional contributors to the study include first authors Ting Du, Aditya Raghunandan, and Humberto Mestre, and Virginia Pl&aacute;, Guojun Liu, Antonio Ladr&oacute;n-de-Guevara, Evan Newbold, Paul Tobin, Daniel Gahn-Martinez, Saurav Pattanayak, Qinwen Huang, and Weiguo Peng with the University of Rochester.

Thus making “the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy” reality reply tim333 2 hours agoparentI think it's more likely to come from attempts to merge their brains with AI.

Whenever I sleep badly, or not long enough for some days in a row, my cognitive performance deteriorates rather quickly. Supposedly, the glymphatic system‘s work has a major role to play in this. Melatonin also has been found to have a stimulating effect on the glymphatic system, though we need better trials on that. reply _DeadFred_ 3 minutes agoparentI'm going to sound like a quack, but... I had long Covid for years. It was horrible. I said f it and started trying internet 'folk' remedies. Simply taking melatonin at night had me so much better in a month. I have mountain biked every day for the last two weeks it is awesome (other than my zero leg strength). Before that I didn't really even leave the house for 3 years. And I can think and write code at the level I used to again now that the brain fog is lifted. I think there were trials on this and they determined it didn't work but it's crazy a little bottle from the grocery store (USA here so it's over the counter) changed my life. reply JonChesterfield 19 hours agoparentprevLook up creatine as a candidate treatment for sleep deprivation. reply washadjeffmad 18 hours agorootparentCreatine plus exercise. I add 1.5 tsp to my morning tea, plus 1/5 tsp NAD and 1/2 tsp of L-theanine, and I've doubled my workout and no longer have DOMS. It's like I'm a teenager again. I tried it because I'd been getting 4-5 hours of broken sleep due to peripheral neuropathy from a congenital spinal disorder for the past four or five years, and I finally feel like I'm healing. It's wild being able to fall asleep and stay asleep. reply hgomersall 11 hours agorootparentAre there long term studies on the effects of creatine? I was asking given the evidence for increased cancer, and mortality associated with high red meat intake, but a lack of understanding re the causative mechanisms. reply ImHereToVote 10 hours agorootparentI think mouse feed is probably the healthiest diet according to mouse models. reply grugagag 17 hours agorootparentprevDo you only take it in the days you exercise? Does it have any side effects? reply esperent 17 hours agorootparentCreatine is one of the very few supplements that seems to have only upsides and few if any side effects (except the basically obligatory \"minor stomach upsets for some people\" ). You can take it every day at any time of day, the effects take a few weeks to build up. The main downside is that the effects are small - most of the research is in strength and endurance training and it seems like at most there's a 5-10% increase in lifting endurance (IIRC, it's been a while since I researched this). It's one of a very few supplements that I personally feel should be generally taken by most people (unless you eat a lot of red meat). The others are omega 3 (unless you eat fish several times a week) and possibly magnesium as the western diet tends to be low in that. If you want to read more about effects of creatine on the brain this is a good paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7916590/ The consensus seems to be that supplementation of creatine is less clearly linked to increases in the brain than it is for muscle (although there have only been limited studies done), however, if you've ever suffered from depression, sleep deprivation or other neurological issues it's likely to be beneficial. For people without those issues, there's less evidence yet, but they would still get the benefit of more energy overall if not specifically more cognitive energy. reply slowmovintarget 4 hours agorootparentThe caveat is finding a high-quality supply of creatine. So many on-line reviews for once great brands of creatine powder talk about how those brands recently switched to a new supplier, how the consistency changed to that of powdered sugar, and how all of a sudden they were getting major gastrointestinal problems from a brand that used to be good. It's hard to know where to go for the right kind of supplement. I've taken it as an exercise supplement in the past with no seeming downsides, but in a few hours search, I couldn't find a supply that doesn't have dozens to hundreds of these complaints against it. reply Gormo 3 hours agorootparentAre there any high-quality suppliers you can recommend? reply kridsdale1 1 hour agorootparentKre-Alkyn on Amazon has a patented method of getting it past the stomach acid which I’ve found, over many, years, removes the bloating issues with monohydrate (most common) reply ekanes 3 hours agorootparentprevCreatine is awesome, but hair loss in men with male pattern baldness is frequently reported by myself and others in comments under all the \"creatine is amazing no downsides\" youtube posts and elsewhere. I've experienced it personally. reply grugagag 2 hours agorootparentIs it temporary? Does hair loss go away when you stop taking creatine? reply thefz 12 hours agorootparentprev> and few if any side effects I don't know your dosage and use case but under creatine loading (5+ grams/die), water weight and bloating becomes a very, very noticeable side effect (in responders). reply unaindz 7 hours agorootparentafaik that's temporary and lasts only a few weeks, even if maintaining the loading dose. The effect also seems localized to muscles so unless you are overweight the effect is mostly flattering. reply sizzle 12 hours agorootparentprevI know someone who got painful kidney stones from Creatine. Pretty scared of taking it now reply throwuxiytayq 5 hours agorootparentI know someone who got painful kidney stones and didn’t take any creatine. Pretty scared of not taking it now reply chrisweekly 15 hours agorootparentprevIs Vitamin D's omission from your list deliberate? reply esperent 13 hours agorootparentI originally put it in, along with vitamin c during flu season, but felt I haven't personally done enough research to make claims about them. Regarding vitamin d, I am unsure about whether it should be taken with vitamin k or not. reply _0ffh 10 hours agorootparentWith K2 to counteract the risk of soft tissue calcification. reply Retric 15 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a common deficiency especially in the winter, but most people don’t benefit from regular supplements. At least assuming 20ng/mL is a reasonable minimum. Some people suggest that’s a little low, but there’s real issues with excess vitamin D. reply mgarfias 14 hours agorootparentSo take k2 with your d3 reply pitched 8 hours agorootparentprevYou need to be drinking more water while taking creatine. This is important to point out because the side effects of not getting enough water are very rough and taking creatine can put you there faster. reply washadjeffmad 16 hours agorootparentprevEveryday. It's retained in skeletal muscle, so I consider it similar to carb loading on off days. I exercise at least lightly every morning and get around 5 miles in a day. My biggest struggle is being diligent about getting enough protein and calories. From everything I've read, creatine is as close to being a \"free benefit\" as it gets. I didn't experience any overt improvement just from taking it, as in, no extra energy or motivation. However, I'd stalled on all of my exercises for about a year, and after a week of \"loading\" 10g/day, I started back and instantly hit my max reps in a single set. I didn't want to hurt myself and was scared of DOMS, so I waited another week before trying again (I had a single day of soreness). After a light warmup, I immediately did it again. The results of that have been highly motivating, and I've remained excited to push myself. The only side effect is that I enjoy my tea slightly less. Creatine doesn't have a flavor, but it makes everything taste 20% less delicious, somehow. reply autokad 15 hours agorootparentprevit does, but only for some. for me it causes massive muscle cramps, no matter how much water I drink. other then that, creatine is considered the only supplement (protein not considered a supplement) that has virtually no side effects and known gain. caffeine is behind that with some side effects. beyond that, most other supplements havent been either to have proven benefits and proven no side effects reply tucosan 7 hours agorootparentprevCan you point to any good research to back up your claim that this is a good treatment? reply JonChesterfield 4 hours agorootparentI liked this one https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54249-9 They went with the premise of \"a little a day seems to help, what happens if we feed ridiculous quantities once\". The sort of medical research that appeals to the engineer in me and something you can only really do with compounds that are already known to be unlikely to kill your patient if you exceed the usual dose. Also I strongly suspect they did this to students given the age range. There's more literature out there than this. That paper's references are probably a reasonable start point. But as creatine is very cheap and has been widely consumed by athletes for ages now it's about as low risk a gamble as any out there. reply manmal 12 hours agorootparentprevI‘m taking creatine every day, and think it’s great for various reasons. Do you think it has an affect on sleep quality itself, or does it just improve things during the day? reply pitched 8 hours agorootparentI personally find that sleep quality does drop a bit but I also don’t need as much every night. The sleep-tracking apps I use say the opposite though, that quality is much higher and I get more hours in. It’s a bit of a different flavour of sleep maybe, that the apps aren’t tuned for. reply ggm 21 hours agoprevAre there non drug methods which could restore or assist lymph pumping functions in the head-neck region? Should we all be doing some kind of rotation/lift/squeeze cycle on our cervical spine region? reply thordenmark 20 hours agoparentExercise, good food, and good sleep. Pretty much the universal panacea. reply thordenmark 20 hours agorootparentSounds easy, but difficult in practice. Especially for those of us chained to a desk all day. reply OutOfHere 19 hours agorootparentprevMild to moderate exercise won't fix it, but intense exercise, e.g. running or similar, carries hope. Good sleep will slow the damage, but after a certain age, e.g. 80, it may not work. reply aussieguy1234 17 hours agorootparentWhat about a hard workout with weights every day? reply OutOfHere 15 hours agorootparentI have tried it in this context, but no, I'm sorry. Only running and similar intense cardio exercises had an applicable effect for me. That's not to say that other exercises are useless; obviously they're not, but the other exercises didn't help this particular issue for me. reply manmal 12 hours agorootparentprevThat might set you up for overtraining. If your ability to regenerate is good/fast enough, it might work. Measuring heart rate variability is a good indicator for when you’re ready for more exercise. reply hinkley 18 hours agorootparentprevCardio specifically, right? reply halfcat 17 hours agorootparentAll of it is ultimately needed. Cardio, yes, but resistance training is also needed to maintain muscle mass, and maybe even more important as we age, bone density. reply hi-v-rocknroll 20 hours agorootparentprevFor disabled and elderly people, these aren't always possible. reply BobaFloutist 19 hours agorootparentAppropriate exercise is all the more important for disabled and elderly people. reply manmal 12 hours agoparentprevLymphatic massage should help. It has helped my recurring ear issues tremendously, and is actually quick and easy to do. There are plenty of YouTube videos out there, some for the whole body and some for the face/neck area. Here is a short video for the back of the neck: https://bornfree.life/images/neck-lymphatic.mov reply OutOfHere 20 hours agoparentprevNafaik, but anything that gives you two extra hours of sleep should help. Also, intense exercise should over time help heal it in part. And as far as drug methods go, a 2-3 month course of memantine could be worth exploring for anyone who doesn't have to drive or operate machinery for the first month. reply citruscomputing 19 hours agoparentprevJade roller/gua sha? Also look up \"post ffs lymphatic massage\" or similar. This helps me when my immune system is acting up. Not sure if it'd help with the CSF specifically, but this is how to move lymph out of the head. reply pedalpete 20 hours agoprevThis study in aging adults measured amyloid in blood with phase-targeted auditory stimulation, the technology we've been developing at affectablesleep.com - it's not exactly the same as measuring the glymphatic process, but might be related. reply DoreenMichele 21 hours agoprev\"Unlike the cardiovascular system which has one big pump, the heart, fluid in the lymphatic system is instead transported by a network of tiny pumps,\" Not entirely accurate. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25427090 reply manmal 12 hours agoparentSince you seem knowledgeable, what do you think of the idea of blocks in lymph, eg through scar tissue or infections, which might need extra massage? Is there something to this? reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 7 hours agoprevWonder if dexamethasone has similar effect - felt much younger when it was prescribed to me for brain swelling. reply aszantu 12 hours agoprevwould explain why head massages are feeling extatic, external massage of those lymphangions maybe? reply hyrix 21 hours agoprev [–] In mice reply alephnerd 21 hours agoparent [–] Mice are in the same clade as primates, and share around 95-99% of the same genome as primates. We're all part of the Euarchontoglires clade reply cyberax 20 hours agorootparentThe problem is that primates are pretty far removed from mice. And our sheer weight difference often makes is a decisive factor. This is especially true for cancer, brain, and inflammation research. Mice just don't make good models for that. reply robwwilliams 19 hours agorootparentNot sure why you think weight is such a key variable. Might make sense if you had focused in bone mineral density—although mice have been extremely useful to study osteoblast and osteoclast biology. Mice gave us a very solid understanding of cancer genetics. Cancer was initially thought of as an almost purely environmental disease. Thanks to “in mice” we learned that genetic susceptibility is a major factor. Transplantation biology and immunology have profited enormously from mouse models—-and more “recently” everything from monoclonal antibodies to CAR-T cells. And when you say “brain” who could been a dozen different things. I can assure you that mouse models are highly useful and translationally relevant to many neurological, behavioral, developmental, and physiological studies of the mammalian brain. reply cyberax 19 hours agorootparent> Not sure why you think weight is such a key variable. I worked in cancer research-adjacent area (on computational biology). The problem with mice was that cancers in mice necessarily contain fewer cells than human cancers. So a lot of treatments can simply clear these cancers completely, without giving them a chance to evolve resistance. Yes, you can try to compensate for that, but it just is not reliable. In addition, mice are notoriously naturally susceptible to cancer. So their cancers, counter-intuitively, are often less evolved as a result. > And when you say “brain” who could been a dozen different things. I basically mean \"degenerative brain diseases\", very much including aging. reply alephnerd 20 hours agorootparentprev> that primates are pretty far removed from mice They are a good initial test for viability because of the overwhelming genetic similarity. This is why mice and rodents are used to test initial viability before then moving on to theraputics development. You can read some sources if you want [0][1][2] [0] - https://www.jax.org/why-the-mouse/excellent-models [1] - https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/research-at-cambridge/animal-... [2] - https://www.genome.gov/10001345/importance-of-mouse-genome reply cyberax 20 hours agorootparent> This is why mice and rodents are used to test initial viability before then moving on to theraputics development. They are used because they're the _only_ way to test drugs early in development. Animal cruelty laws make it nearly impossible to use non-murine species for initial drug tests. Additionally, mice are easy to breed and to keep, and there's a great variety of specialized genetic lines. reply alephnerd 20 hours agorootparentAbsolutely, yet the underlying similarity between our genomes makes it good enough for most cases, plus the Rodent genome has been sequenced and tested for decades now. Idk why you are trying to die on this hill. I've provided decently authoritative sources (The Jackson Institute, Cambridge University, and the NIH) Unless you have a PhD in Systems Biology or Genomics, I'm going to trust them over you. Edit: an actual OG in the field of genomics just commented - listen/chat with him, not me. reply cyberax 19 hours agorootparentFor most cases, yes. Antibiotics discovery? Sure, mice are awesome. But mice make really bad models for anything to do with brain, aging, inflammation, and cancer. That's why comments \"in mice\" are appropriate in these areas. And it's not at all controversial, here are my citations: https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1222878110 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6615039/ Mice studies are not useless, for sure. But they're almost always are not directly translatable to humans. reply hombre_fatal 20 hours agorootparentprev [–] Yet none of that matters because only a tiny fraction of interventions make it from rat models to humans. reply robwwilliams 19 hours agorootparent [–] Ditto from Phase 1 to Phase 3. Side effects always an issue. One could say only half in jest that humans are not particularly good models for humans. Exceedingly expensive and all kind of environmental and compliance confounders. At least when using rodent you can control the environmental factors in a randomized controller “clinic” trials. Compliance not so hard to ensure. reply Consider applying for YC's first-ever Fall batch! Applications are open till Aug 27. GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

There's a nice write up on the capability here: https://www.cnx-software.com/2024/08/15/raspberry-pi-rp2350-... reply phire 19 hours agoparentThe main advantage of the SIO TMDS encoder, is that it allows you to output TMDS on any GPIO, instead of the eight that the HSTX is restricted to. And they allow an easy upgrade path for projects that were already bit-banging DVI on the rp2040. Other than those two advantages, I don't think there is any advantage to the SIO TMDS encoder over the HSTX TMDS encoder. I get the impression that the SIO TMDS encoder was added to the design first, and there wasn't a good reason to remove them after the introduction of HSTX. reply jauntywundrkind 18 hours agoparentprevIsn't hstx mainly good for streaming out? My naive guess would be that it wouldn't have as much transceiver offload capabilities, like what the SIO I naively guess would be good for. The nice part about using SIO seems to be that you can do the tdms encoding there. With hstx you need the output bitstream in the right format already which seems like you might be back to needing the CPU to do the encoding. reply phire 17 hours agorootparentHSTX has a built in TMDS encoder, and as far as I can tell, it has all the functionality of the SIO TMDS encoder. You can configure it to directly consume any line buffer with any pixel format, from 1 to 8 bits per color channel. It even supports formats with different numbers of bits per channel like 8-bit RGB322 and 16-bit RGB565. reply onetom 15 hours agorootparentwhat's the fun in that though? i have the impression, that the main motivation for this project was learning the intricacies of TMDS encoding and providing an open implementation as reference for other ppl, who want to learn too. there are too many black box electronics these days, so it's very much welcome to virtually open them up, by providing software equivalents of their operation. reply szundi 11 hours agorootparentFun is to proceed to the next fun faster reply sitkack 19 hours agoprevThis is amazing, not only did they port from the 2040 to the 2350, but they also ported all the functionality they could support over to the RV32 cores as well.

I have an nVidia Jetson but its boot sequence turns off the HDMI output at some point. It would be nice if I could show a placeholder screen while the Jetson is booting. Would something like that be possible by using this RP2350 board? reply ale42 11 hours agoparentNot directly because it can't handle retransmitting the existing HDMI signal. You probably need to add a HDMI/DVI switch IC like this one: https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad8196.html reply psd1 6 hours agorootparentI've tried a few commercial hdmi switches, to share a monitor between machines. The switch time is long and the monitor doesn't reliably wake up. Perhaps it's related to eDID? Do you know how that chip is for real-world usability? reply kees99 2 hours agorootparent> switch time is long and the monitor doesn't reliably wake up In my personal experience, obtuse monitor's firmware is often to blame. Using a switch with one extra input port, where all data pins are connected to ground (via series resistors), and switching to that port for a brief moment, before switching again to the real intended input, usually helps some. reply amelius 50 minutes agorootparentIsn't it possible to create a valid and stable HDMI signal based on two inputs? I can imagine that some memory is required to synchronize both signals. Is there an IC that can do that? reply dezgeg 10 hours agoparentprevI'd be surprised if that was not fixable in the Jetson with pure software changes. reply Palomides 20 hours agoprevcan the RP2350 do a higher resolution? it would be a neat option for some retrocomputing stuff if so reply raphlinus 19 hours agoparentMy understanding is that the HSTX can do twice the bit clock as the frequency of the CPU, as opposed to 1x for RP2040. So 800x480 (60Hz) is possible with no overclocking (295MHz bit clock) and Luke said [1] he got 1280x720 50Hz with overclocking (530MHz using CVT-R according to the video timings calculator [2]).

Especially with the HSTX block which can apparently output at double the system clock (while the rp2040 was limited to 1/10th of the system) If my rough math is correct, it should be possible to do output 720p 60hz video with an overclock to ~320Mhz. Though, actually generating that many pixels might be hard when you have nowhere near enough memory. I would love to see some solid infomation about how well the rp2350 overclocks, apparently 300mhz is easy. 60hz 1080p is almost certainly out of reach, it would require something like a 700mhz overclock, but 30hz 1080p is probably viable. reply jsheard 18 hours agorootparent> Though, actually generating that many pixels might be hard when you have nowhere near enough memory. Even if you don't have enough memory or CPU time to render true 720p, it's nice to be able to output 360p or 240p inside a 720p container with each pixel and line duplicated two or three times. Doing it that way gives you nice crisp pixels rather than the blurry mess the displays internal upscaler would probably produce. You can even insert blank lines to get a faux-CRT-scanline effect. reply phire 17 hours agorootparentAnd HSTX is actually pretty flexible. Nowhere near as flexible as PIO, but it can repeat pixels by itself (though, it uses the shift, so you can either pack multiple pixels per 32-bit word, or repeat pixels, not both). Scanline doubling/tripping and blank line inserting can be done with nothing more than DMA chaining. reply vardump 12 hours agorootparentprev> while the rp2040 was limited to 1/10th of the system Isn't RP2040 capable of outputting at system clock rate? reply dmitrygr 6 hours agorootparentprevThe two chips I have will both run at 350MHz with Vcore at 1.3V.

It would simplify connection to a KVM or software-emulated display/keyboard/mouse. Low FPS would be enough for dashboards and CLI. reply u8080 10 hours agoparentYes, this theoretically could be done using DP Alt-mode for type-c.

USB2 data lanes are still functional in this mode. https://newnex.com/technology-articles-dp-alt-mode-over-usb-... reply yonatan8070 12 hours agoparentprevI don't think you can do it direcly.

Then, using their host software, view the HDMI display output and send mouse and keyboard inputs with ease. I haven't tried it, so I can't speak to how well it works, but it sounds promising.

Communications between such a thingamajig capture card and a laptop has nothing to do with DP Alt mode or USB HID, it's whatever custom USB packet types that capture card manufacturer comes up with. That technically wouldn't be an answer to your original comment in strict sense. The most likely heuristic paraphrasing for your original query is something like \"are there ways to multiplex DP _source_ and HID _peripheral_ on a single USB3+DP Alt connection\". That made no sense at multiple levels on top of being unlikely to be possible. That lead to people hallucinating wildly. The alternate question \"are there ways to plug an SBC into laptop somehow for remote control, over a single USB-C cable\" has that dongle as an answer as we now know in hindsight. But that is not a straightforward interpretation and response for your original comment, especially with your follow-up replies about DP Alt mode specs that would not be used by such a device. reply g15jv2dp 9 hours agoparentprevThis already exists, right now...?

There very well should be. You could present as a device and offer networking and have usb-ip advertised over multicast on that port. Easy, weekend project at most, would be dead obvious to any practitioner. USB4 as a packetized protocol really should offer something. I do wish there were like a half speed 2.5Gbit usb4 option, that microcontrollers could have some hope of accelerated bit banging. reply transpute 15 hours agorootparentAccording to Wikipedia, DisplayPort 2.0+ can coexist with USB data on the same cable, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort [2.0] .. using only two lanes on the USB-C connector via DP Alt Mode to allow for simultaneous SuperSpeed USB data and video [2.1] .. tightened its alignment with the USB Type-C specification as well as the USB4 PHY specification to facilitate a common PHY servicing both DisplayPort and USB4. In addition, DisplayPort 2.1 has added a new DisplayPort bandwidth management feature to enable DisplayPort tunnelling to coexist with other I/O data traffic more efficiently over the USB4 link. reply jauntywundrkind 2 hours agorootparentI thought the comment was talking about both sides of the USB cable exposing devices to the other, when they said: > Is it theoretically possible to have 2-way HID reply FlyingAvatar 18 hours agorootparentprevHaven't USB hubs done this since USB 1.1? reply yonatan8070 12 hours agorootparentI believe that the author is talking about plugging in a USB-C cable between your laptop and some headless system, and having your laptop send HID data, while also capturing a display output from the headless system reply bonzini 7 hours agorootparentIsn't that exactly what a USB-C docking station does?

You'd need hardware that can receive DisplayPort, but it's doable. reply numpad0 6 hours agorootparentLooks like an Alt Mode host with DP sink capability is technically allowed...? But it also looks like USB host controllers with Alt Mode support exposes internal DP source driver inputs, rather than handing you bunch of bare copper wires in Alt Mode, so I doubt it realistically has an implementation. ref: https://vesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/USB-DevDays-2019... reply BenjiWiebe 16 hours agorootparentprevAfaik this is 100% allowed by the spec. Flash drives are bidirectional (in and out). Hubs present multiple devices to the host through one cable.

It’s not unusual to get a ping about an expense, but this was a new one. Google Cloud had charged me a round $100 – an unusual amount to spend. The previous day I was experimenting with Google Cloud Run, trying to migrate our Next.js staging environment from Vercel to there to save some money. I assumed I misconfigured that service and turned it off and went about my day. A few hours later I got another expense alert: this time for $200 (!). Now I was worried. It didn’t help that I was working from a coffee shop, it was about to rain and my laptop battery was almost dead. 😅 After speed walking the trip home while listening to Bride (I’m making my way through the Trending Books), I got to work tracking down what was happening. What’s the Issue? My first stop was to Google Cloud Billing. That should narrow the issue down. The new expense was there – I wasn’t crazy. It seemed to level off, which was a good sign. This confirmed there was something costly happening, but what? I clicked over to the breakdown by service and it was clear: Cloud Storage expenses were up 2,098% 😅 Whelp, I wondered if this day would come. Let me back up and mention what services we’re using real quick. What Google Cloud Services Does Hardcover Use? Not much. In fact only 3. The rest of our services are hosted elsewhere. Google Cloud Storage – We store all cover images, author avatars, user avatars, and various static images in Google Cloud Storage. I’ve previously used S3 for this, but we’re anti-amazon. Google Cloud Run – We have exactly one process in Cloud Run, our Image Resize Service (Imaginary) I wrote about last year. It cut our $1,000 bill down to $50/month or less with no loss in functionality. If you’re using Imgix or Cloudinary, it’s kind of amazing. Google CDN – The Image Resize Service doesn’t do any caching, so we throw a CDN in front of it that aggressively caches images. Cloud Run and the Google CDN have worked absolutely perfectly. I haven’t even touched them in 11 months. Not once. I hadn’t touched Google Cloud Storage either, but that was the problem. 😅 When I initially setup Google Cloud Storage, I made the bucket (the storage container per-environment) public with optional private files. This allowed user avatars, cover images and other images we show on the site to be publicly accessed, but save user uploaded CSVs privately in the same place. For their part, Google adds a lot of alert messages when a bucket has public access. It’s almost like they know something I don’t. Turns out the Internet is a Dark Forest (I just re-read The Three Body Problem after the Netflix series and will use any chance I can to drop it into conversation 😂). My decision to keep our Google Cloud Storage public was the culprit. So, What Actually Happened? We’re still working that out and looking for ways to improve, but here’s the theory. Someone has been hitting our API pretty hard recently. They likely downloaded a large amount of data from it – including every edition with URLs for covers. Those cover images are direct URLs to Google Cloud Storage. For example: Example URL https://storage.googleapis.com/hardcover/external_data/ 36306160/04fdf2f73287526f8326413f4d3d7ec77999b832.jpegCode language: JavaScript (javascript) These are the images that were public. Downloading a few images from here wouldn’t have shown up on my radar. In this case, someone decided to download up to 10k images/second… for close to 7 hours. This is equivalent to about 650 mb/second for that time period. That’s about 16 TB of data. We don’t even have that much in our bucket! They must’ve downloaded many things multiple times. For most people in our Discord they’re using our API to create fun things based on their history. It turns out we need more protections in place to stop bulk access. An Easy Solution With Issues The solution for this technically difficult, but it’s a pain: making this bucket private. Doing that immediately would cause the site to no longer show images, and would prevent anyone using the API from getting images. We needed a plan to make it private and generate signed URLs for all images that expire after a set period of time. Signed URLs are a variant of the original URL with additional parameters. I think of it like sending an address (the URL) and a combination (the additional parameters). You can generate a signed URL using the Google Cloud Storage API, hitting it with a specific file and a duration. That URL will look something like this: Example URL https://storage.googleapis.com/hardcover/external_data/36306160/04fdf2f73287526f8326413f4d3d7ec77999b832.jpeg?GoogleAccessId=hardcover-production%40hardcover-313100.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1723846732&Signature=gQ81vjCntrus3j5xbr2r7XEQ30DCTye4ikwdrAQvhwlGGeUJuJ760n9f2o%2B70zjM91%2Bng3C4pWgZzp2DFWdXH2%2BAZMFv1pYMzk%2F20x66NKnZ2dX%2BbQuVu6BgDsIw%2BvmLzEnsMbN6RGm0Dlq0V8e8JoEWrohR5UkN1n5YscnOBywZgsSxIQ8KrL079GeCvWvdE%2B%2BAldLuHT0JhFyo76hJE%2Ba7tCUBuL8drPQSKaHguLrbMjrtuW8%2FfuKRSOnY8wMgI%2FQcFVZPDuA5uVXchi67zVu26RFraBO93MxfhwuIpFHVft6ViRxLF0irLp%2FGDTzDPwpR5vBSLlMPk58ByxxTeg%3D%3DCode language: JavaScript (javascript) This URL contains a few specific parameters that Google Cloud Storage can use to authenticate this URL including GoogleAccessId, Expires and the Signature. Unless all 3 of these are correct you’ll get an Access Denied error from Google Cloud Storage. On the walk home from the coffee shop I started brainstorming how to add these to Hardcover. If you’re ever wondering if a walk will help you think: the answer is most likely yes. 😂 Failed Solution #1: Change the URLs in our Database I know what I didn’t want to do: rewrite all images in our database. Even if we make them private, those image URLs are correct. Also, since signed URLs expire after a set period of time, if we went this route, we’d need to regenerate 5 million signed URLs over that time period. This did get me thinking about how long we should allow URLs to be used for. I landed on one day. We can’t regenerate 5 million signed URLs everyday – nor do we need to. This option was out. Failed Solution #2: Update the API to return Signed URLs Our API (Hasura) connects straight to our database. If someone requests 100 books with covers, what they’re getting back is straight from our database. Ruby and Rails aren’t involved. In other words, we have no way to override the static value from that column in the database. Nor should we. That endpoint to get data about editions and books should be allowed to be accessed at a much higher rate. If we were to generate signed URLs at that step it would slow down the entire system which relies on book data. Having our API return signed URLs in bulk was out. Failed Solution #3: Generate Signed URLs in Next.js Next.js is responsible for presenting all information to visitors of this site. It seemed like this might be a valid solution. Before we show a URL for any image we could generate a signed URL, cache it in Redis for 24 hours then use that. There are two major problems with this. First off, generating the signed URL would need to happen on the server. Unfortunately, we use cover images that have been downloaded client side. It’d be unrealistic to fetch information about a book on the Next.js client side, send it to the server to get the URL, then use that. Not impossible, but not great. The other problem was bigger: API users wouldn’t have access to this! We’d effectively taken away the ability to download images. Actual Solution: Just use Ruby on Rails I’m a huge fan of Ruby on Rails. I’ve been using it since before version 1.0 back in 2005. All of Hardcover’s backend business logic is in Rails. Back when I worked at Code School, we served a lot of videos. At one point our video host went down and we scurried to get a backup solution in place. We landed on using an intermediary service that would redirect to the actual host. I thought this would work for Hardcover too. Updating the Website to Support Signed URLs Here’s how that works in practice. Rather including the image from Google Cloud Storage directly, we’d change this to proxy through our Ruby on Rails site. For example: Example URL https://projector.hardcover.app/signed/images/crop?url=https://storage.googleapis.com/hardcover/…jpeg&width=100&height=100Code language: JavaScript (javascript) That URL is doing a lot. Let’s break it down. First, it’s hitting an endpoint in Rails, in this case it’s a route in our Ruby on Rails application. rails/config/routes.rb namespace :signed_assets, path: :signed do resource :images do get :crop get :enlarge end endCode language: Ruby (ruby) This tells Rails to create a two new routes at /signed/images/crop and /signed/images/enlarge. These will go to the controller which needs two methods for enlarge and crop. Those actions need to do a two things: generate a signed URL for the passed in URL and redirect to that URL. It should also cache this generated URL. We don’t need to regenerate it every time someone looks at cover. I decided to cache these for 1 day. rails/controllers/signed_assets/images_controller.rb module SignedAssets class ImagesController < ApplicationController # GET /signed/images/enlarge def enlarge redirect_to_signed_url(\"enlarge\") end # GET /signed/images/crop def crop redirect_to_signed_url(\"crop\") end private def signed_params @enlarge_params ||= params.permit(:url, :width, :height, :type) end def url @url ||= Rails.cache.fetch(\"/signed/images/signed/#{signed_params[:url]}\", expires_in: 24.hours) do ExternalStorage::Google::Cloud.sign(signed_params[:url]) end end def redirect_to_signed_url action if url.nil? head :unprocessable_entity else redirect_to \"https://cdn.hardcover.app/#{action}?url=#{CGI.escape(url)}&width=#{signed_params[:width]}&height=#{signed_params[:height]}&type=#{signed_params[:type]}\" end end end endCode language: Ruby (ruby) This is a mostly standard Ruby on Rails Controller. The public actions are URL endpoints we set in the routes file. The private methods help with code reuse and organization. The bulk of the work happens in the url method. First, we check if the given URL is in the cache (we’re using Redis). If something with those contents exist in Redis, we return it any never run the contents of the block that comes after. If a signed URL isn’t in the cache, we call ExternalStorage::Google::Cloud.sign to generate a signed URL. I’m not going to get into generating a signed URL. We’re using the google-cloud-storage Ruby gem which handles everything, including the line that actually hits the Google API: ExternalStorage::Google::Cloud.sign signed_url = file.signed_url method: \"GET\", expires: 3600*25 # expires dailyCode language: Ruby (ruby) These URL endpoints need to be FAST. Loading a page with 100 covers means this endpoint will be hit 100 times. My first iteration didn’t have caching, which led to a 250 ms wait PER IMAGE. With caching it’s 250 ms for the first request, then less than 1 ms after that. The generated URL will be the same, which also means that the image will be cached on the CDN. If a user refreshes a page, they’ll still hit Rails to generate URLs for all images, but they’ll use the images cached by their browser. (side note: I’d like to improve this even more. Any recommendations?) Updating the API to Support Signed URLs Things are working for our website visitors, but we need to do one more step for API users: create a new endpoint for generating signed URLs. Hardcover has an API that registered users can use for accessing their book and reading data. If you’re building something with it, you’ll have our existing Google Cloud Storage URLs already. I ended up creating a single new endpoint, image_url_signed. It takes in a URL (which could be a cover, avatar or anything) and we return a signed URL. Behind the scenes this Hasura API endpoint will hit another Rails controller with a single endpoint for generating a signed URL. It’s pretty much the same as the other controller. rails/app/controllers/hasura/signed_assets_controller.rb module Hasura class SignedAssetsController < Hasura::BaseController skip_before_action :set_paper_trail_whodunnit # Returns a signed asset URL for the given url # GET /hasura/signed_assets def index url = Rails.cache.fetch(\"/signed/images/signed/#{input_url}\", expires_in: 24.hours) do ExternalStorage::Google::Cloud.sign(input_url) end render json: { url: url } rescue ExternalStorage::Google::Cloud::AccessDenied head :forbidden end private def input_url @input_url ||= params.require(:url) end end end Code language: Ruby (ruby) It even uses the same cache as for website users! 🙌 Last Step: Throttling API Use With this setup everything works, but we haven’t fully fixed the problem. Someone could still hit our new API endpoints repeatedly and bypass our newfound security. Hasura has an option that could help here: API Rate limits. Unfortunately, this is a Hasura Enterprise feature, and we’re mere peasants on the free version. It can even rate limit by user id from a JWT – which is exactly how we determine the owner of a request. I’m considering moving back to enterprise once we can afford it, but that’s out for now. Fortunately this endpoint is in Rails. We can lock it down on that side instead. After a little Googling, I found the beautiful rack-attack gem that does exactly what I was looking for. If you’re not from the Ruby world, you might not have heard of Rack. Think of Rack is the base layer that most Ruby web frameworks are built on (Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Hanami and others). It handles the low level request/response cycle. The rack-attack gem builds on that with features for IP allowing, blocking and throttling. In our case we wanted to throttle the API endpoint with at 60 requests a minute, but the website endpoint at 500 a minute – equal to browsing at a steady pace. This ended up being so much easier than I thought. It only needs a new initializer. rails/config/initializers/rack-attack.rb class Rack::Attack Rack::Attack.cache.store = ActiveSupport::Cache::RedisCacheStore.new(url: ENV[\"REDIS_URL\"]) throttle(\"hasura/signed_assets\", limit: 60, period: 1.minute) do |req| req.params[\"user_id\"] if req.path == \"/hasura/signed_assets\" end throttle(\"/signed/images/enlarge\", limit: 500, period: 1.minute) do |req| req.ip if req.path == \"/signed/images/enlarge\" || req.path == \"/signed/images/crop\" end endCode language: Ruby (ruby) This also uses Redis and will generate a key for each endpoint using the value returned from the block. This allows us to throttle the API endpoint to 60 requests/minute based on user_id, while the public endpoint used by the website has a limit of 500 requests/minute based on IP address. What’s great about this setup is that this run before Rails has even handled the request – that’s the beauty of middleware. This will return a 429 Too Many Requests header after they’ve reached their limit. Limiting the API More? One of the reasons I started Hardcover in the first place was because Goodreads discontinued their API. I’ve never run a public API before, but want to make sure we’re being good stewards of book data by the community as well as everyones personal book data. I have a few other takeaways from this experience that we’ll put into place in the near future: mostly for rate limiting, reporting, limiting API access to areas that you don’t need access to and expanding on our API terms of service. What will always be true is that you’ll be able to get any data about books, editions, authors, series, publishers, characters, your library and whatever people that follow you have decided to share. 📚 ← More from the blog Footer links Community Readers & Supporters Join Our Discord Follow Along BlogHardcover LiveAbout HardcoverRequest a feature We're an Open Book Frequently Asked QuestionsContact SupportRoadmapOur Policies iOSAndroidDiscordTikTokMastodonInstagram Home Library Explore Trending Search",

Essentially, it ensures that a URL is invalid unless the server signs it with a secret key controlled by the server, which means that clients can't access your assets just by guessing the URL. In addition to signing the URL, the signature can contain metadata such as permissions and expiration time. reply riedel 13 hours agorootparentIs there any advantage over JWT other than one can put the token into the URL itself (which is technically also possible with JWT I guess, with the downside that it will be probably exposed in logs, etc.)? reply jacobr1 1 hour agorootparentThese came out before JWTs gained broad adoption. They are accomplishing the same technical objective via a different implementation. reply inopinatus 12 hours agorootparentprevThe signature is verified by the origin bucket/cdn endpoint, so it's in the format used by the applicable public cloud, without depending on any application-specific cookie or bearer values, and with CORS/CSP interactions you can easily reason about. Signature values could appear in the logs the cloud provider writes, but won't be in your application logs unless you, for example, specifically write out the Location of a 30x redirect (which would be relatively uncommon), and in any case the ephemerality makes them basically uninteresting. reply kijin 12 hours agorootparentprevSigned URLs work with dumb storage such as Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage. You might want to use JWT to authenticate someone before handing out a signed URL, though. reply dyogenez 21 hours agoparentprevOhh good catch. Just updated the post with a section mentioning what signed URLs are before jumping into the solution. reply shortrounddev2 21 hours agoparentprevRather than allowing any object on a bucket to be downloaded by its raw URL (i.e: http://mycdn.io/abcdefg.jpeg), the backend service needs to generate a \"signed\" url, which is a short lived URL that grants the user a single request against that resources (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) (i.e: http://mycdn.io/abcdefg.jpeg?signed={securerandomstring}) So you can only use the URL to download it once, and you need to go through the backend API to generate the presigned URL. This could result in your backend getting hammered but you can also use DDOS protection to prevent 10k requests a second from going through your backend Theyre also a good way to allow users to upload images to your CDN without having to actually upload that data to your web API backend; you just give the user a presigned PUT request URL and they get a one-time ticket to upload to your bucket reply taeric 20 hours agorootparentWorth calling out that the big benefit is you basically lean on the service provider for streaming the data, without having to form a trust relationship between them and the receiver of the data. That is, the entire point is to not put more compute between the requester and the data. The absolute worst place to be would be to have compute that is streaming from the data provider, so that they can stream to the end user. Right? reply shortrounddev2 16 hours agorootparentExactly.

I realized this while working from a coffee shop and spent the rest of the day putting in place a fix. This post goes over what happened, how we put an a solution in place in hours and how we landed on the route we took. I'm curious to hear how others have solved this same problem – generating authenticated URLs when you have a public API. reply wrs 20 hours agoparentIt sounds like you had public list access to your bucket, which is always bad. However, you can prevent list access, but keep read access to individual objects public. As long as your object names are unguessable (say, a 16-byte random number), you won’t have the problem you had. I haven’t used Rails since they integrated storage, but gems like Paperclip used to do this for you by hashing the image parameters with a secret seed to generate the object name. Using signed URLs is solving a different problem: making people hit your API at least once a day to get a working GCS URL for the image. It’s not clear if that’s an actual problem, as if people want to enumerate your API (as opposed to your bucket), they can do that with the new system too. That aside, I’m confused about the 250ms thing. You don’t have to hit a Google API to construct a signed URL. It should just be a signature calculation done locally in your server. [0] https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signing... reply dyogenez 3 hours agorootparentThanks for the comment! Few things to reply to from here. We didn’t have list access enabled, but someone did get a list of files from our API. Rails with Paperclip and active storage is amazing. Our front end is in Next.js though, so we have people upload straight from Next to GCS, then we sent the GCS URL to Rails. We don’t do pre-processing of images, so just storing the original is good. They can still download every image, but they’ll be throttled now and kicked out at the middleware level, or permission denied from GCP. 60/min vs 10k/min. The signature calculation happening might not be hitting Google in that case. I noticed a long data dump in the console after requesting the signed URL combined with the additional latency and assumed. Maybe it’s just a cryptically difficult calculation like bcrypt and it takes a while. Will have to check, because it’s be great to not need a network reliant call for that. reply hereonout2 20 hours agorootparentprevThis was my understanding of signed URLs also.

We could rate limit it there though, which would be nice. The downside is that people already have the URLs for existing bucket directly. So we'd need to change those either way. The reason why the attacker couldn't just hit the API to get the signed URLs is due to rate limiting that I go over using the rack-attack ruby gem. Since that's limited to 60/second, that's more like 43k images/day max. reply arcfour 21 hours agoprevI immediately groaned when I read \"public bucket.\" On AWS you'd put CloudFront in front of the (now-private) bucket as a CDN, then use WAF for rate limiting, bot control, etc. In my experience GCP's services work similarly to AWS, so...is this not possible with GCP, or why wasn't this the setup from the get-go? That's the proper way to do things IMO. Signed URLs I only think of when I think of like, paid content or other \"semi-public\" content. reply 0xbadcafebee 20 hours agoparentGoogle Cloud makes it insanely difficult/non-obvious what services you should use to solve these problems (or how to use them, because they're always difficult to use). They have a maze of unintuitive product names and sub-products and sub-sub-products, finding them in a UX is ridiculous, there's no useful tips/links/walkthroughs in the wizards, and their docs are terrible. It's like being trapped in the goddamn catacombs of Paris. On AWS, using buckets with CDN, ALB & WAF are obvious and easy, but on GCP it's a quagmire. The other thing is, AWS WAF was released in 2015, and the Google Cloud Armor WAF feature (the what now?) was released in 2020. reply written-beyond 20 hours agorootparentHonestly this is exactly how I felt about GCP when I was building something that would be used by millions of people. At that scale it's very easy to shoot yourself in the foot and boy does Google make that easy. There were so many things that were outright wrong in their documentation that caused me many sleepless nights. Like not recommending using a pool or closing cloudSQL connections in server less functions because they'll be closed automatically when the instance spins down. Don't get me wrong I had used pools extensively before, and I knew you had to close connections but their docs and examples would explicitly show the connections not being closed, just left for them to close when the instance spins down. Idk why they never thought that an instance might never spin down if it's getting hammered with requests and you end up with hundreds of open connections over multiple instances until GCP starts killing your requests telling you \"out of connections\" in a server less instance. The vaguest possible error which after a lot of debugging you understand that you can't have more than 100 open connections on a single function instance, but you were technically never supposed to have more than one open at any given time. sigh reply dyogenez 21 hours agoparentprevThat's a good idea. I probably could've put a CDN in front of this and rate limited there while keeping things public. That might've been faster than using Ruby to be honest. The downside was that our API already shared the non-CDN URLs, so that would leave the problem open for anyone who already had that data. reply arcfour 20 hours agorootparentThe bucket is private though, only accessible through the CDN. The old URLs would cease to function. On AWS this is implemented through OAI/OAC, granting the CloudFront distribution access via its own unique principal. AWS has had a baseline security recommendation for years now to disable S3 public access at the account/org level. Maybe this breaks things, maybe you need to expire some caches, but (forgive me for being blunt, I can't think of a better way to say it) that's the cost of not doing things correctly to begin with. My first thought as a security engineer when setting something up to be public has always been \"how hard could someone hit this, and how much would it cost/affect availability?\" reply antihero 20 hours agoparentprevThat said, if you use CF in front of S3 (which you should), anyone with a gigabit connection can easily cost you hundreds of dollars. I know this because I did this to myself accidentally. reply arcfour 18 hours agorootparentWith WAF simple IP-based rate limiting is very simple & cheap.

You could use Hetzner, or you could use some giant cloud infra. Both get the job done. Why do you care which is used? You probably care because you don't like waste.

Like the time it takes to get something done, or the technical ability required, or the ability to find someone else to maintain something, or its flexibility in being changed. Or maybe just the fun of building something with cool toys. You originally commented with cost being the factor. But if the person building this doesn't mind an additional cost, then they don't need to build it on DO or Hetzner. That said, if they do built it on the cloud, they do need to keep in mind the cost... just like if they built it on DO or Hetzner, they would need to keep in mind how to rebuild the instance when it goes down, how to maintain the instance's OS for security patches, etc. Both require additional considerations besides the one thing.

My rule of thumb for a basic web server is 100k QPS per physical core on cheap hardware, slowing down if it's doing anything intensive (depending on the nature of the images being requested and how the requests are distributed relative to the disks' layouts, they could have been pegged at the disks' throughput for example), speeding up if you have a particularly light workload or better hardware. reply jeffhuys 11 hours agoparentprevThey don't use AWS, by the way.

For everything high traffic and/or concurrency related my go to solution is dedicated sockets. Sockets are inherently session-oriented which makes everything related to security and routing more simple. If there is something about a request you don’t like then just destroy the socket. If you believe there is a DOS flood attack then keep the socket open and discard its messaging. If there are too many simultaneous sockets then jitter traffic processing via load balancer as resources become available. reply intelVISA 13 hours agoprev10k/s... is that a lot? Computers are insanely fast nowadays..! reply lionkor 12 hours agoparentNo. It's not a lot. 20-30k req/s is easy for serving simple, small files. If you have beefy machine (say, a $50 hetzner rootserver), you get a few TB of storage and unlimited or cheap bandwidth. 8-16 cores can easily(!!!) push this kind of data without even heating up, not sure wtf OP is doing. Well, I know what OP is doing - they fell for the idea that the cloud is more scalable. The issue with this is that the cloud™ starts \"scaling\" at the first user, whereas a baremetal server needs to scale when you have saturated a 8-16 core modern CPU, a 1-10 Gb/s NiC, 30-60 GB of RAM. In other words, baremetal needs to scale when you actually run out of hardware resources, which is tens or hundreds of thousands of users later. Edit: for example, at BeamMP, we run on a few bare metal servers, and serve 22k unique users per day in a multiplayer videogame service. Funded by around 800 people donating. reply jeroenhd 10 hours agorootparentBased on the names of the endpoints, I get the idea that they're altering the image files on the fly (and probably caching processed files) based on the URL. I've seen this quite often on blogs and such. Serving files shouldn't take much CPU power, but resizing images can get quite expensive, especially if you want to achieve lower egress fees by using better compression methods. Still, you need to deal with bad scrapers. Plus, this scraper downloaded at a consistent 650mbps, taking up half the unlimited Hetzner pipe by itself; if you'd go for a 10gbps Hetzner machine, you suddenly start paying egress fees once you hit 20TB of traffic. Even then, if you go the cheapo Hetzner server route, you probably still want at least some kind of CDN to keep latency down. Add to that costs of backups and synchronising failovers, and you may end up with more traffic than you'd expect. I think going bare metal would save more than the signed URLs would, at least until the ten thousanth customer, but not everyone is proficient in maintaining servers. A lot of cloud projects I see are coming from programmers who don't want to/don't know how to maintain a Linux server and just want to run their code. If you're in that category, taking time off to learn server maintenance or hiring a sysadmin can easily be a lot more expensive than paying the extortionate rates cloud providers demand. reply nirui 11 hours agorootparentprevI'm not a fan of cloud too, but I have to admit that the networks of these big cloud providers built is just better than self-hosted ones. When they say they'll distribute your file globally, they mean it, as long as you pay of course. But I would rather say, cloud is not for everyone. Especially in the case mentioned in the article. Think this: do you really REALLY need to distribute enlarged images globally at top speed? I bet most people just don't. Same thing goes for \"scaling\", it's true the cloud can do that very well, but do you really need it that bad? reply quectophoton 7 hours agoparentprevYou also need to take into account the size of each response, how long your server needs to keep the data in memory (e.g. because of latency, the requester's bandwidth, etc), whether requests to the same file can share a buffer or not, how much data you can be sending at the same time while still being responsive (e.g. without slowing down other responses, causing them to take longer, requiring you to keep those resources in memory for longer, and snowballing from there), ..., stuff like that. For short text messages, probably not an issue. With larger stuff like images or video, I would be more careful. Still, even for text-only, if you're using PostgreSQL, by default you have a limit of (I think) 100 parallel connections (or 97, because I think 3 are reserved for superusers), but each connection can only be executing one transaction at a time, so that can quickly become a bottleneck depending on your application and how fast you need to make queries vs how long your queries take to return a response. So then you might need to tune some PostgreSQL settings, or add caching, or some other way to work around the issue. If you add more services, then you also need to keep in mind the latency between those services. And so on and so on. So RAM and network would probably become an issue way earlier than CPU in most cases. TL;DR: \"It depends\". reply solatic 14 hours agoprevDid you try sticking your bucket behind Cloud CDN?

There are many different reasons you'll want rate limiting at every layer of your stack, for every request you have: brute-force resistance, [accidental] DDoS protection, resiliency, performance testing, service quality, billing/quotas, and more. Every important service always eventually gets rate limiting. The more of it you have, the more problems you can solve. Put in the rate limits you think you need (based on performance testing) and only raise them when you need to. It's one of those features nobody adds until it's too late.

I had a look at the site - why does this need to run on a major cloud provider at all? Why use VERY expensive cloud storage at 9 cents per gigabyte? Why use very expensive image conversion at $50/month when you can run sharp on a Linux server? I shouldn't be surprised - the world is all in on very expensive cloud computing. There's another way though assuming you are running something fairly \"normal\" (whatever that means) - run your own Linux servers. Serve data from those Linux computers. I use CloudFlare R2 to serve your files - its free. You probably don't need most of your fancy architecture - run a fast server on Ionos or Hetzner or something and stop angsting about budget alerts from Google for things that should be free and runnong on your own computers - simple,. straightforward and without IAM spaghetti and all that garbage. EDIT: I just had a look at the architecture diagram - this is overarchitected. This is a single server application that almost has no architecture - Caddy as a web server - a local queue - serve images from R2 - should be running on a single machine on a host that charges nothing or trivial amount for data. reply dyogenez 20 hours agoparentIf you're able to do that, then you have a huge skill! I'm not much of a devops engineer myself, so I'm leveraging work done by others. My skills are in application design. For hosting I try to rely on what others have built and host there. If I had your skills then our costs would be much smaller. As it stands now we pay about $700/month for everything - the bulk of it for a 16gb ram / 512gb space database. reply ksnsnsj 20 hours agoparentprevI have read this argument before. Of cause you can do everything yourself _but it is not free_ You are missing both development cost and much more importantly opportunity cost If I spent a person year on a cheap run architecture while my competitor spent a person year on a value add feature add, he will win reply cuu508 12 hours agorootparentDepends on what skills you have, but running everything on a single machine rather than messing with multiple cloud services can also be cheaper in development cost. reply BigParm 21 hours agoparentprevHow much does it cost to have an ISP let you do that?

I mean technically it's not free. It's just that they have a very generous \"Forever Free\" number of read operations (10M/month, $0.36 per million after). reply Spivak 20 hours agoparentprevDon't use cloud, use these two other clouds. This right here is the issue, the skills and know how to buy hardware, install it in a data center, and get it on the internet are niche beyond niche. Entering the world where you're dealing with Cogent, your Dell and Fortinet reps, suddenly having strong opinions about iDRAC vs iLO and hardware RAID is well beyond what anyone wants to care about just to run some web servers. When people talk about major cloud providers being expensive the alternative is never /really/ to do it yourself but move to a discount hosting provider. And it's not as if there isn't savings to be found there but it's just another form of cloud optimization. We're talking about a story where $100 of spend triggers an alert. The difference is so minuscule. reply blibble 21 hours agoparentprevyeah, as a crotchety old unix guy, 10k requests a second was a benchmark 30 years ago on an actual server today a raspberry pi 5 can do 50k/s with TLS no sweat reply BenjiWiebe 14 hours agorootparentCan you give me an example of how to do 50k/s with TLS on an rpi?

Whether it's on commodity hardware or in the cloud, whether or not it's using a CDN and edge servers, there are ways to \"nip things in the bud\", as it were, by rejecting requests without a proper signed payload. For example, the value of session ID cookies should actually be signed with an HMAC, and checked at the edge by the CDN. Session cookies that represent a authenticated session should also look different than unauthenticated ones. The checks should all happen at the edge, at your reverse proxy, without doing any I/O or calling your \"fastcgi\" process manager. But let's get to the juicy part... hosting files. Ideally, you shouldn't have \"secret URLs\" for files, because then they can be shared and even (gasp) hotlinked from websites. Instead, you should use features like X-Accel-Redirect in NGINX to let your app server determine access to these gated resources. Apache has similar things. Anyway, here is a write-up which goes into much more detail: https://community.qbix.com/t/files-and-storage/286 reply MassPikeMike 13 hours agoparentThanks for making me aware of X-Accel-Redirect! The write-up discusses X-Accel-Redirect's functionality in the context of qbix. For me, the two were rather hard to tease apart in that context.

Introducing Hermes 3: A new era for Llama fine-tuning We are thrilled to announce our partner Nous Research’s launch of Hermes 3 —the first full-parameter fine-tune of Meta's groundbreaking Llama 3.1 405B model, trained on Lambda’s 1-Click Cluster. Designed for the open-source community, Hermes 3 is a neutrally-aligned generalist model with exceptional reasoning capabilities, now available for free through the new Lambda Chat Completions API and Lambda Chat interface. Powered by an 8-node Lambda 1-Click Cluster, Nous Research achieved outstanding results in just a few short weeks. Hermes 3 meets or exceeds Llama 3.1 Instruct on Open Source LLM benchmarks (see table below). \"Lambda’s 1-Click Clusters make the experience of renting and using a multi-node cluster as simple and easy as renting and using a single node,\" -Jeffrey Quesnelle, co-founder of Nous Research Hermes 3: A uniquely unlocked, uncensored, and steerable model Hermes 3 is the latest advancement in Nous Research's series of models, which have been downloaded over 33 million times. This instruct-tuned model is specifically designed to be flexible and adept at following instructions. It excels in complex role-playing and creative writing, offering users more immersive character portrayals, deeper simulations, and unexpected fictional experiences. In addition to its creative capabilities, Hermes 3 is an invaluable tool for professionals requiring advanced reasoning and decision-making abilities. Its strategic planning and operational decision-making features include function-calling, step-labeled reasoning, and more. Optimized for efficiency Hermes 3 was meticulously trained using synthesized data and supervised fine-tuning on Meta’s Llama 3.1 405B base model. This was followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and finally, quantization using Neural Magic’s FP8 method. This optimization effectively reduces the model's VRAM and disk requirements by approximately 50%, allowing it to run on a single node. “Since the start of my journey in AI I wanted to bring about the realization of an open source frontier level model that aligns to you, the user - not some corporation or higher authority before the user. Today, with Hermes 3 405B, we've achieved that goal, a model that is frontier level, but truly aligned to you. Thanks to our hard work on data synthesis and post training research, we were able to make a dataset that is fully synthetic over almost a year in the making to train Hermes 3 - and will be releasing much more to come.” -Teknium, cofounder of Nous Research For those seeking dedicated access and flexibility, Hermes 3 can run on a single node (available on-demand on Lambda’s Cloud), or quickly scale to a multi-node 1-Click Cluster for further fine-tuning using Lambda's scalable cluster infrastructure. Try Hermes 3 for free - for a limited time! We’re excited to offer the AI/ML community free access to Hermes 3 through Lambda’s new Chat Completions API, fully compatible with the OpenAI API. It provides endpoints for creating completions, chat completions and listing models. No complex setup is required—simply generate a Cloud API key from Lambda’s dashboard (sign-up) and start exploring with our documentation’s help. For a more interactive experience, we’re also providing a simple chat interface: try your prompts in Lambda Chat!",

I am experimenting with summarizing and navigating documents for forensic psychiatry work, much of which involves subjects that instantly hit the guard rails of LLMs. So far, I have had zero luck getting help from OpenAI/Anthropic or vendors of their models to request an exception for uncensored models. I need powerful models with good, hipaa-compliant privacy, that won’t balk at topics that have serious effects on people’s lives. Look, I’m not excited to read hundreds of pages about horrible topics, either. If there were a way to reduce the vicarious trauma of people who do this work without sacrificing accuracy, it would be nice. I’d like to at least experiment. But I’m not going to hold my breath. reply d13 21 hours agoparentAll base, “text-completion” models are uncensored, including Llama 3. You can make text-completion models behave like an uncensored “instruct” (chat) model simply by providing it with 10 to 20 examples of a chat dialogue in the initial prompt context, making sure to use the model’s exact prompt format. Once the model notices the pattern, it will continue like that. Surprisingly few people seem to know this. But, this is how chat models were created in the GPT3/2 era before instruct models became the norm. reply rustcleaner 15 hours agorootparentI often force compliance out of Llama by starting Llama's response in a very compliant manner. My favorite use right now is for language translations. I finally feel comfortable browsing foreign languages, knowing Google isn't sitting there as a third party with a coherent view of my foreign language readings! reply davidzweig 17 hours agorootparentprevI was trying this with the original llama model. I guess the model didn't really know it's meant to be a 'knowledgeable ai assistant', but rather simulated chats it had seen. If you asked it, 'how to make brownies', it might reply, 'idk, can't you google it?'. reply d13 7 hours agorootparentWhen you prime it with those initial 10-20 examples, the responses need to be in the style that you’d like it to respond to. You can use Claude or ChatGPT to help you write those. The model will then just continue on in that same style. reply viraptor 7 hours agorootparentUnfortunately those examples blow up the cost compared to just asking the question. It's a nice workaround, but not always feasible.

I tried uploading obscure books I've already read, to GPT4 and Claude 3 and asked them to summarize the plot and particular details, as well as asking how many times does a particular thing happen in the book, and the results have been hit and miss. I certainly would not trust these models to create comprehensive and correct summaries of highly sensitive records. reply simonw 20 hours agorootparentAsking \"how many times does a particular thing happen in the book\" is always going to be hard, because LLMs are notoriously bad at counting. reply campers 15 hours agorootparentAsk it to output the occurrences as items in a JSON array, then count the array items in code reply torginus 8 hours agorootparentprevNot only that, asking an LLM a question like: \"List all the occurences where John Doe fights someone in the book.

ChatGPT uses RAG on large documents which is useless for many tasks. reply miki123211 19 hours agorootparentprevFor whatever it's worth, asking a model to count is a terrible idea due to how they work. You may have more luck with a hybrid approach, using LLMs for language understanding and computers for the counting. For example, ask them to write a short, one-line description of every instance where something happens, and then use a traditional program to count the lines. reply phren0logy 18 hours agorootparentprevIf you chunk the document well (which is surprisingly tricky with messy documents), then you can do summary via map reduce or other techniques. To be clear: I don't trust it to provide an accurate summary; it's not meant to replace reading the documents. But it may help to find relevant parts of a document later, or get a reasonable overview of documents before starting a manual review. I expect (but will have to see) if it's better than just opening up a random PDF and starting there. I recently had a case with over 24k pages of records, some of which were in PDFs that were thousands of pages long. The ability to do semantic search rather than keyword search was useful for when I said to myself, \"Didn't I see something about that before? Where was that?\" reply sroussey 18 hours agorootparentI’ve found summarizing this way is a great idea but the summarizing models are not great themselves. Would even prefer an embedding with the summary as maybe the embedding would be better. reply kainan-ai 21 hours agorootparentprevYeah its more creative than other fine tunes, you'd need to make a pretty strict system prompt then test before doing anything with sensitive records reply pnw 22 hours agoparentprevI just tried it and it appears to be censored. \"Providing instructions on creating such materials is not advisable for safety and legal reasons.\" reply kainan-ai 21 hours agorootparentIf you take the base model and put in a decent system prompt Hermes 3 405b will follow your system prompt instructions pretty well.

The Dolphin ones appear to be the most useful. reply kainan-ai 20 hours agorootparentHermes 3 will follow the sys prompt pretty closely if you have a version where you can edit it.

I will say watching it in the discord I saw its performance vary widely so the context and sys prompt plays a huge role. Initially it did great and solved some pretty heavy logic questions but after the context was loaded with trolling it degraded quite a bit and couldn't solve problems it previously was able to. reply sivers 21 hours agoprevPAYMENT TANGENT for my fellow entrepreneurs here that take Visa/Mastercard payments: I tried to sign up to Lambda Labs just now to check out Hermes 3. Created an account, verified my email address, entered my billing info... ... but then it says they only accept CREDIT cards, NOT DEBIT cards. I had never heard of this, so I tried it anyway. I entered my business Mastercard (from mercury.com FWIW), that's never been rejected anywhere, and immediately got the response that they couldn't accept it because it's a debit card. Anyone know why a business would choose to only accept credit not debit cards? I don't have any credit cards, neither personal nor business, and never found a need for one. So I deleted my account at Lambda Labs, which was kind of disappointing since I was looking forward to trying this. reply throwaway240403 21 hours agoparentThat seems completely backwards? Debit interchange fees are usually lower aren't they? and if you run it with a pin as a debit there's almost no charge for the vendor. Definitely weird, as everything I know about the incentives for that go in the other direction for a vendor. reply moduspol 17 hours agoparentprevI think I read somewhere that forcing credit cards is a way for the merchant to completely avoid prepaid cards. Though obviously imperfect. Privacy.com had to overhaul their card generation backend a few years ago specifically to handle merchants refusing their single-purpose card numbers due to them being detected as potentially prepaid cards. Though they did do it, so it might work for your case now. I'm sure there's a fraud angle where someone signs up with a cheap prepaid card, runs up a huge bill, and then the business has no recourse. Though I'm not familiar with Lambda Labs or their billing. reply mtremsal 21 hours agoparentprev> Anyone know why a business would choose to only accept credit not debit cards?

    "originBody": "Have you ever heard the saying, \"Slow is smooth, smooth is fast?\" It's a mantra deeply ingrained in Navy SEALs operations. A counterintuitive concept that flips our usual understanding of speed and efficiency on its head. Picture this: you're part of an elite team executing high-stakes missions under extreme pressure. There's no room for error, but there’s also urgency – every second counts. You feel the urge to rush. But what if running only leads to mistakes? This phrase isn't just about being slow or fast; it's about finding a rhythm that balances precision and pace, ultimately leading to swifter progress. The SEALs swear by it... but how can we apply it beyond military contexts? I got your attention, didn't I? Let's dive deeper into the roots of this idea and understand why taking it slow can be critical.

What is the Navy SEAL motto? What is the mantra of the Navy SEALs? Who first said slow is smooth smooth as fast? Conclusion The Origin and Application of \"Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast\" in Navy SEALs This mantra, known well within the special operations world, resonates with Navy SEAL teams. It encapsulates a principle that guides their actions in high-stakes situations. Understanding the Mantra's Meaning \"Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\" At first glance, this saying seems counterintuitive. Rather than hastily striving to keep up, this mantra reminds Navy SEALs that accuracy should be prioritized over speed. But rushing can lead to fatal mistakes for Navy SEALs who operate under intense pressure and tight timelines. This phrase urges them instead to prioritize precision over speed. The theory goes: moving deliberately (slowly) ensures each action is performed correctly (smoothly). When actions are done smoothly without error or need for correction – they inevitably become faster overall. Instances of Mantra Application in SEAL Operations Navy SEALS applies this philosophy during complex operations where quick thinking and decisive action are paramount. One such example was Operation Neptune Spear - the mission which led to Osama Bin Laden's demise. Despite facing unexpected challenges like a crashed helicopter, the team remained composed, prioritizing careful movement over hasty reaction, an embodiment of \"slow is smooth...\". This calculated approach helped them complete their mission successfully. In training, too - whether it’s shooting drills or tactical maneuvers - recruits learn early on that attempting tasks too quickly often leads to mistakes, and those errors slow down overall progress. It’s a lesson hard-won but never forgotten. The Importance of Slowing Down in Chaotic Situations Why is slowing down crucial? The slightest mistake can have catastrophic consequences in high-stakes operations where SEALs operate. Rushing increases chances for error, which could jeopardize missions or even cost lives. This mantra underscores that taking an extra second now is better than losing several minutes (or worse) later fixing avoidable blunders. Whether defusing a bomb or conducting stealthy surveillance, moving with deliberate precision trumps speed alone. Key Takeaway: The mantra \"Slow is smooth, smooth is fast\", cherished by Navy SEALs, underscores the value of accuracy over haste in high-pressure situations. Actions become more streamlined and ultimately quicker by being mindful and sidestepping hasty blunders. This golden rule was a game-changer during operations such as Operation Neptune Spear and continues to be a pivotal teaching point in training drills. In tumultuous circumstances where mistakes can be costly, The Importance of Slowing Down in Chaotic Situations In high-stakes environments like military operations, slowing down is more than a suggestion. It's the cornerstone of effective decision-making and efficient execution. Consequences of Rushing in Complex Operations Rushing can cause slip-ups that would have been prevented if one had taken more time and consideration. For instance, if you're disarming an explosive device or conducting surveillance on enemy territory, moving too fast can result in missed details or mistakes that jeopardize the mission and put lives at risk. This concept isn't unique to military situations either. Think about when you rush through your morning routine because you overslept; chances are you'll forget something essential or leave your home looking less than presentable. The Role of Coordination and Planning A pause for planning may seem counterintuitive during chaos. But it’s crucial for preventing errors and enhancing efficiency - especially within teams where coordination is critical. Navy SEALs, renowned worldwide for their exceptional skills, use this principle effectively by emphasizing slow-and-smooth movements over rushed ones – leading us back to our mantra: \"Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\" Applying \"Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast\" Beyond Military Contexts Moving beyond battlefields and covert missions - this mantra holds value even in everyday life scenarios such as business practices or project management. Incorporating the Mantra into Business Practices For businesses, rushing to launch a new product or service can lead to overlooked details and subpar customer experiences. However, slowing down the process allows for more thorough testing, feedback collection, and refinement - ensuring a smoother (and often faster) route to success. Harvard Business Review discusses this balance between speed and quality in their article on strategy vs purpose – reinforcing that slowing down can be the quickest way forward. Using the Mantra for Project Management In project management, too, hasty decisions might seem productive initially but usually result in more rework later. Key Takeaway: In high-stakes situations, slow and steady wins the race. Whether it's disarming explosives or launching a new product, rushing can lead to mistakes that put success at risk. So take a page from Navy SEALs: \"Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\" This principle isn't just for military ops - it works in business and project management too. Applying \"Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast\" Beyond Military Contexts While deeply rooted in Navy SEAL operations, the concept of \"slow is smooth, and smooth is fast\" has potential applications far beyond the battlefield. This mantra encourages mindfulness and precision over haste - a principle that can be harnessed greatly in other spheres of life. Incorporating the Mantra into Business Practices In the quick-paced corporate world, it may appear that hurrying through tasks is a successful way to stay on top of things. But as any seasoned entrepreneur knows, rushed work often leads to errors that slow progress. This mantra advises businesses to focus on speed, accuracy, and efficiency. By slowing down processes initially and focusing more intently on getting them right from the outset—essentially smoothing out wrinkles—you eventually increase your pace without compromising quality. Using the Mantra for Project Management The same wisdom applies effectively within project management practices too. A project manager might feel compelled under tight deadlines or budget constraints to hurry things along; however, this often leads to overlooking key details, which later come back as costly issues needing rectification. The Project Management Institute (PMI) echoes similar sentiments about thorough planning and coordination being crucial factors in achieving faster outcomes. Tips For Applying The Mantra In Various Spheres Of Life: - Be deliberate: Whether it’s a military operation or preparing a business report – take time upfront rather than rushing blindly into action. - Prioritize quality over speed: Fast doesn’t always mean efficient. Take the time to get it right. - Keep refining: The more you smooth out your processes, the faster they will become in the long run. By embracing the \"slow is smooth, and smooth is fast\" approach, we boost results and dial down stress. This principle champions mindful action over quick judgments. It nudges us to hit pause, hatch a plan, and synchronize our moves – basically taking a 'chill pill' before diving in. Key Takeaway: Remember, \"slow is smooth, and smooth is fast\", a wisdom from the Navy SEALs. It's not just for military operations - it can also supercharge your everyday life. Whether you're steering a business or leading a project, taking things slow at first to focus on getting them right helps avoid mistakes and ramps up speed without cutting corners on quality. The same idea nudges us towards mindfulness: planning thoroughly before diving in. The Role of \"Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast\" in Team Dynamics Regarding team dynamics within Navy SEAL teams, the mantra \"slow is smooth, smooth is fast\" plays a significant role. It's not just about speediness or productivity; it's also concerning collaboration and avoiding mistakes. Promoting Smoothness in Team Operations In high-pressure situations where every second counts, one might think faster action equals better results. But this isn't always true. This Navy SEAL principle suggests otherwise - slow down to go smoothly, and by doing so, you'll move faster overall. Akin to precision machinery operating at peak performance when well-oiled and maintained. The Mantra's Impact on Team Efficiency Aiming for quick wins can sometimes lead us astray due to hasty decisions or poorly executed actions, causing errors that require correction time – slowing progress instead of speeding it up. The philosophy behind \"slow is smooth, smooth is fast\" emphasizes taking the time necessary for each task—no matter how small—to ensure flawless execution with minimal mistakes. This approach helps enhance team efficiency because members don't constantly have to backtrack or redo tasks because they were rushed initially. Applying this mantra to team operations promotes a smoother workflow, ultimately leading to faster overall progress. Furthermore, this method prevents panic-induced errors while fostering calmness under pressure – critical elements in enhancing operational effectiveness among Navy Seals. Whether defusing explosives or planning covert operations, these professionals understand the value of meticulous attention to detail and precision. Their effectiveness in high-stakes situations is a testament to this mantra's validity. Interestingly, though rooted in military training, its applicability extends far beyond. Many industries have adopted this principle, understanding that speed often comes at the cost of accuracy. Wrapping it up, Key Takeaway: The Navy SEAL mantra \"slow is smooth, smooth is fast\" enhances team efficiency by emphasizing meticulousness over speed. By slowing down and ensuring flawless execution of tasks, teams can prevent errors that would otherwise require time to correct, leading to faster overall progress. This approach also fosters calm under pressure - which is crucial in high-stakes situations. Overcoming the Urge to Rush Through Tasks We often rush through tasks to get them done as quickly as possible. While understandable in our fast-paced world, this tendency can lead to errors and inefficiencies. The mantra \"slow is smooth, smooth is fast\" used by Navy SEALs offers a solution. Strategies for Slowing Down The first step towards slowing down is recognizing when we're speeding up unnecessarily. Notice when you're going over the speed limit in a car and back off on the gas. A practical strategy here involves mindfulness practices. Awareness of your actions and intentionally slowing down can significantly affect task performance. Beyond awareness lies planning – plotting steps before diving into execution mode can save time later. Effective planning, similar to what military units do before operations or businesses before launching products, helps ensure smoother progression with fewer hiccups along the way. Mistakes from Moving Too Quickly Rushing often leads us astray; studies show that moving too swiftly during complex procedures increases error rates. Errors reduce quality and demand additional time for correction—ultimately negating any perceived benefits from hurrying. In contrast, approaching tasks unhurriedly allows room for better precision and accuracy, resulting in superior outcomes—a philosophy that Navy SEALs and their rigorous training programs embrace. The Navy SEAL Approach to Slowing Down Navy SEALs are famous for pulling off challenging tasks even when the pressure is sky-high. They make this happen by sticking to one key principle. Slow down to speed up. Rushing tasks may seem efficient, but studies show it often leads to more errors. The Navy SEALs know this - their mantra is \"slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\" Be mindful and plan your moves for better results. #Efficiency Click to Tweet FAQs with Slow is Smooth Smooth is Fast Navy Seals What is the Navy SEAL motto: slow is smooth smooth is fast? \"Slow is smooth smooth is fast\" implies taking time to move efficiently reduces errors and ultimately quickens operations.

Everyone walks in, day one, and is dumping adrenaline everywhere they look. I mean, the person in front of you is literally engaging you in practicing murder, so I get it. Everyone starts that way. Super tense, super shallow breathing, and everyone wears themselves out in about 30-40 seconds. Of a 6 minute round. Doesn’t matter if you’re the most insanely buff dude ever, or seriously overweight. The first guy has better conditioning, no doubt… but not this kind of conditioning. One of my favorite things was watching a new guy walk in, looking like he had maybe 7% body fat, 6’2” at least, plays D1 basketball, and is just nothing but stacked muscle… and then him rolling with a 5’6” 130lb woman who just wipes the floor with him, because training matters more than strength, but even more importantly, breathing and staying calm, slow, and smooth matters even more. The basketball player spends the first minute or so using all his strength to try and get this “puny” girl off of him, unable to, and is now completely gassed. Meanwhile she’s tapped him twice and could go for a run. Eventually, the most important thing you learn is to relax and breathe. Technique eventually comes, through iteration and lots and lots of practice; eventually, things become second nature. But breathing? Reminding yourself to relax and roll smart, not fast? That I need to remind myself of most days, because again: you’re facing someone practicing killing you. :) reply beau_g 18 hours agoparentJiu Jitsu practitioners have incredible conditioning from repeating that exact same story of {guy who thought he was tough} being defeated by {unlikely protagonist} in any scenario they can shoehorn it into, with extreme enthusiasm reply maximus-decimus 17 hours agorootparentIt was Judo and I was a scrawny teenager, but a black belt used to hold me to the floor by doing head stands on me so... you hear those stories a lot because they're true.

A huge part of beginner training is basically slow down and getting yourself into positions where you can perform the moves. reply borski 18 hours agorootparentprevFair point, but it's because when you've seen it firsthand it almost looks fake, except that you know exactly why it happens. It's a lesson that many of us learn and then take into other aspects of life, because it's really humbling. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 16 hours agorootparentprevPretty sure every martial art has a version of this tale.

The myth of the 130 lb woman doing anything to theis overused and not true; unless the man is being a gentleman. I routinely get beaten by small women because I’m not a spazoid and I want my training partners to enjoy training with me. But if my life was on the line, there’s no way they could tap me. Not even a chance. reply borski 10 hours agorootparent> I routinely get beaten by small women because I’m not a spazoid and I want my training partners to enjoy training with me. This is not the kind of thing I’m talking about. Of course we all regularly get “beaten” by people with less skill and who are smaller, or bigger, or anything else - but I’m not talking about training with a partner or letting them practice a technique during a roll. I’m talking about people that walk in with their egos very high and their skill very low. There are those who come in and are almost afraid to use any strength at all. Then there are those who believe that strength is all you need, so on their first few rolls they gas out immediately and then get rocked. I’m not suggesting that two trained people of vastly different weight classes would be equally matched. That would be absurd. Also, I’m not talking about your life being on the line. I’m talking about BJJ. reply adamtaylor_13 4 hours agorootparentMy interpretation was that yours was the \"130-pound woman can hurt 180-pound new class guy who 'just sees red'\" story. My point was that it's largely mythos. Not that it _never_ happens, but by and large weight matters even in untrained vs trained individuals. reply w3gS34k354K7978 14 hours agorootparentprevI can tell you it’s a real thing because it happened to me. 6’3” and at that time (19 or 20) was probably right around that 180lbs - no one would have described me as muscular back then though, just skinny more like it. Anyways, first day of training, the first thing the instructor did was assume I needed humble pie. Told me he wanted to see my baseline, said get in the cage, and called over the only female in the class. She was ~5’6” ~140lbs from memory. Not chubby, just stalky and solid. Rest of the class came over to watch with cheeky smiles too. Later found out it was kind of her thing to break in the new guys. She had me in a rear naked tapping out in under 30s. I didn’t know what it signified at the time, but she was a brown belt and regularly took home hardware from regional amateur tournaments. I had ~6 mo striking experience (Muay Thai), but had never rolled, never wrestled in high school. Best and only entry on my grappling resume was growing up with a brother. So it does happen, as I can attest, but I do understand your skepticism if you haven’t seen it, especially because of additional hidden context like this: - I had never directly encountered, and was extremely uncomfortable with, the idea of physically overpowering a female. It was the most unnatural thing, and I was psychologically paralyzed by this until it was way too late. - She had zero chill. Probably read my obvious body language, and knew her play was to blitz. - I didn’t know how rolling was supposed work with any opponent, let alone a female. I didn’t know rolling etiquette, conventions, nothing at all. Not that it would have mattered because she had no intention of offering me the usual respects anyways. If she had attacked me on the street with murder in her eyes, and I reacted with full force, would she still have gotten the best of me? I’d like to tell myself I would’ve bested her in a life or death scenario, but truth is I’m deeply uncertain of the outcome in that hypothetical. reply borski 11 hours agorootparentSome gyms have these “enforcers” and are into this sort of thing. I hate that so much. Not everyone needs humbling. And I think that’s the point that people here are missing. If someone walks in and is calm, respects the fact that the trained person has something they don’t, and so on… even as a skeptic they’ll be relatively fine, and won’t get “wrecked” in most places, at least not on purpose. It’s the guys that walk in thinking they’re about to roll over everybody with their big muscles that get rocked. But they usually end up being great people; just that finding out how much you don’t know is extremely humbling, extremely fast. And I respect that a lot of people don’t believe it. I honestly didn’t myself. I get that; I’m not trying to convince you. reply adamtaylor_13 4 hours agorootparentprevMany people do need that initial \"this shit is real\" check. If you don't tap, I will pop your arm. This isn't karate. The mythos of jiu-jitsu is so much bigger than the reality. I say that with all the love and respect of someone who trains! Size matters. Despite what the brochure says. Each belt is worth about 10-20 pounds of weight. At brown belt, sure, maybe she can beat up a completely untrained 180-pound guy, but with 3 months of training the math changes. I'm not saying \"It isn't real\" in an absolute \"it never happens\" sort of way. I'm saying that it's not true for 90% of the real-world use cases out there. People should train to be aware of their limits and to be fit and capable. But anyone thinking a 140-pound woman is going to terrorize some 200+ pound weight lifter is delusional and hasn't trained before. reply meroes 17 hours agorootparentprevI learned this lesson explicitly Karate when I was younger. I was the spazoid. Had to be told, no, we don’t go even 75% capacity in most exercises, let your opponent carry out the routine when it’s their turn. reply maxioatic 19 hours agoparentprevSame thing with Olympic weightlifting. This is a very common phrase in my gym. Snatching has got to be the most humbling barbell movement ever. Dudes who can easily bench over 100 kg (220 lbs) would never get to close snatching that. (Myself included, but hopefully one day) reply borski 19 hours agorootparentI know nothing about Olympic weightlifting! What makes snatching so unique and humbling? Aside: you don’t have to, but a one sentence definition of it would be awesome too - my lifting has been limited to the classic stuff, no fancy Olympic “bend and snap” stuff ;) reply voisin 19 hours agorootparentYou pull the barbell up from the ground (like a deadlift) while dropping into a squat, and then get it up over your head while standing up. It is much more explosive than either the deadlift or squat separately. reply borski 19 hours agorootparentJust watched a video[0] and yeah, why? I’ve dislocated my shoulder far too many times to have any interest whatsoever in this lmao But - it being explosive makes perfect sense, but what does it work that deadlift or squats alone don’t? Or is the point the explosiveness? [0] https://youtu.be/UBc5N_-xdqo reply dshoemaker 6 hours agorootparentTo answer an aspect of your question that other commenters haven't addressed, the snatch works hip and shoulder mobility in a way that deadlifting and squats do not. The barbell is driven by the explosive hip hinge (unhinge?) directly up, so it is a departure from deadlift even if it looks like it would train the same muscles. Training your snatch lift in a non-competitive sense really exposes imbalances the lifter has. Your hesitance is really reasonable though, it's a non-trivial lift so coming into lifting completely new and trying to throw a snatch up isn't a very good idea. reply borski 3 hours agorootparentYeah, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you for the explanation! reply msy 19 hours agorootparentprevThe point is to use the explosive power of your legs to optimally throw & catch a very heavy thing over your head. It’s not designed specifically to work any particular muscle but test your overall capability. That said it’s much, much harder on core & shoulder stability in particular than either deadlifts or back squat. Or front squat for that matter. reply maxioatic 13 hours agorootparentprevWhy… well, it’s a sport where you compete to lift the most weight. The other competition lift is the clean and jerk. For my old ass I do it because it’s so hard and the rest of my life is fairly soft. Waking up and getting beat down by some snatches (or occasionally having a great session) keeps me level headed in other areas of life, I guess. If you’re not a competitive weightlifter but still training explosiveness for other sports then you’re better off doing variations on the lifts. Like hang snatches, power cleans, power snatches, etc. reply borski 11 hours agorootparentTotally fair, all of it. Thanks for the explanation. When you put it as simply as “it’s about who can lift more weight,” my question looks dumb in retrospect, of course. It would be just as easy for someone to incredulously ask me why I love BJJ, despite being hypermobile and having a much higher chance of injury as a result. It’s about what you love. That’s why you do it. That makes perfect sense. reply timacles 19 hours agorootparentprevThe point is to get a weight from the ground to above your head. There are no other physically possible ways to accomplish that except olympic lifts reply alexchantavy 19 hours agorootparentprevOly lifts are humbling in that being able to squat or press a lot of weight doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be able to snatch a lot of weight because there’s so much technique training required. The explosiveness and the sense of timing is very hard to learn. reply borski 19 hours agorootparentGot it. Fascinating! reply js2 12 hours agorootparentprevIt's an Olympic sport.

Weight classes exist for a reason. reply borski 18 hours agorootparentSure, and I'd agree with you if the much bigger guy could, I don't know... breathe. :) Weight classes exist because they matter amongst opponents of roughly the same skill and training level. If one person is trained and the other is not, they matter a lot less. You're not the first person to be surprised by this and challenge me on it. You also wouldn't be the first person to come to the gym, try to prove your point, and fail. :) reply evantbyrne 17 hours agorootparentEveryone that has cooed grappled has a story like this. Part of the reason is practice, part of it is giving up before the fight even starts, but also that BJJ places constraints on matches in such a way that make physical characteristics matter less between hobbyists. BJJ–and even contact sports like MMA–don't resemble combat from any era of human history, so we might as well cut the pageantry and settle this by seeing who has more caterpillars in their bedroom right now. I've got at least a couple dozen. reply borski 17 hours agorootparentSure, but none of that contradicts anything I said, and... makes my point? Within the constraints of BJJ, which I agree is not full-on combat, obviously... training matters more than weight or strength, a majority of the time. I'm not sure where the disagreement is, and you definitely win on caterpillars. reply evantbyrne 17 hours agorootparentWe are in agreement on the point of the article.

I mean, even in shooting pistol (I shot sport pistol in college), breathing is the main thing you can control, and the main thing that will screw you. reply bravetraveler 9 hours agorootparentIt's true for standing still. Do it long enough and loose/easy is obviously the way. There's no grand insights here, this thread is insane. reply abhijat 6 hours agorootparentThe point is that staying relaxed in boxing during sparring or working the heavy bag feels counter-intuitive in the beginning. It seems like tensing up the core and arms would help punch harder, but you quickly learn that conserving stamina is more important than hitting as hard as you can (especially when starting) because otherwise you run out of gas pretty quickly. reply rasz 10 hours agoparentprev>130lb woman who just wipes the floor with him in the dojo. IRL on the street adrenaline matters and fights end in first 5 seconds. You get stabbed or pushed/thrown/kicked in the face before you realize there was a fight about to happen. What good is grappling with an opponent when his friend will just curb stomp you the second you both go to the ground? reply borski 10 hours agorootparentThis is the most common thing everyone loves to say whenever anyone says they study any martial art, and they use it as an excuse to study no martial arts, because \"what's the point\" I never suggested that BJJ was going to be the only thing you should learn or know if you wanted to defend yourself in a fight. Cross training with some striking (muay thai, boxing, something) and/or weapons training? Sounds great, go for it. To be clear: I have been in my fair share of fights, IRL. I've been stabbed twice. I grew up in Brooklyn and spent a lot of time in, well, less reputable bars and clubs. Most fights do not end in the first five seconds, and you should GTFO if you can, at all. Not fighting is the best way to win. If your opponent has friends with them, GTFO at any cost; that goes without saying. Most fights go to the ground, relatively quickly. When they do, taking their back and getting your hooks in is far better than mounting them, since you can absolutely control them from that position while someone else calls 911 and/or finds help to break up the fight you definitely didn't start, because starting fights is the fastest way to lose them. As for \"adrenaline matters\" - this is explicitly why you train. It absolutely matters. But someone untrained will just spaz. Maybe they get lucky, maybe they don't; but they usually don't. Someone trained may not remember every single thing they know; but so much of it becomes instinctual that even with the adrenaline dump they are definitely not on their best game, but are still far more capable than the untrained individual. Furthermore, competing helps a lot with desensitizing yourself to the adrenaline dumps. Also, \"before you realize there was a fight about to happen\" is not a thing. I have never been 'caught off guard,' because that is not how fights start. Yes, sometimes an idiot will throw a punch at a random person on the street; but that is absolutely not how most fights start. Well before a fight starts, you have already tried defusing the situation and de-escalating, because engaging is a last resort. But sure, maybe their \"friend will just curb stomp you\" so you may as well just never try. reply adammarples 10 hours agorootparentprevWell yes, sport jiu jitsu isn't street fighting. No strikes, slams, small joint manipulation. Soft mats to land on, strictly 1vs1, no weapons, and the list goes on. What use is grappling? It's quite a lot better than nothing in some situations. reply risenshinetech 18 hours agoparentprevThey're not \"practicing murder\". They're not \"practicing killing you\". Stop with this hyperbolic nonsense. The military practices murder, not you and your mates in your local BJJ class. Do you say these things to make yourself feel cooler/tougher when you inevitably tell someone you practice BJJ? And I'm sure they didn't ask, you just worked it into the conversation (much like this post) because you can't wait to tell everyone you practice murder. reply borski 18 hours agorootparentNo, not even a little bit; perhaps you might consider lightening up a little. The point I was trying to make is that when you're on the mats against an actively resisting opponent who is, yes, attempting to break your joints (which is what happens if you don't tap) or choke you out (which is what happens if you don't tap), you don't have a choice but to focus on only the thing in front of you. Your brain and body simply won't let you focus on anything else. \"Practicing murder\" or \"practicing killing you\" is simply a cute way (and obviously exaggerated for effect, since nobody's literal goal there is killing anyone) of describing that last paragraph without having to use all of the words in that last paragraph. I never said I was Deadpool; relax. It's a self-defense focused martial art which, in real life, you would use to prevent someone from causing you harm. So no, I really don't think your comment or this one were necessary. It's pretty cynical to go from 'exaggerating for effect,' which is the obviously charitable reading, to 'mak[ing] yourself feel cooler/tougher,' which is the cynical reading. I haven't been on the mats in over four years, because I had surgery and haven't gone back yet; I miss it.

Getting those out within 12-24h was an intentional part of our model, because our competition would take a week, so it was trivial to make them look bad. That said, it was extremely important for it to be correct, so we never cut corners. Best way to never make a sale is to tell someone they are patched when they’re not.

The sheer volume and size of products that have come and gone IS how they survived[1]. Can any one say, for example, Meta is where it is today by doing any of this Slow is Smooth and that is fast culture? Sure, there were acquisitions(those too were fast) and there are bad initiatives and orgs (alexa, google+social, facebook phone), but then there are also many amazing things like LLMs and MooCs. [1] https://killedby.tech/ reply borski 19 hours agoparentThere’s definitely plenty of survivorship bias in that argument - you’re making the argument that Meta could not have built successful products without also building a ton of unsuccessful ones, which they did by virtue of executing fast rather than slow/smooth. (I’m paraphrasing to try and ensure I’m understanding the argument correctly, just to be clear) The issue is that if you look at Meta’s successful products… 1. Facebook - would have won whether it moved fast or slow. This was network effects, not “features” 2. Messenger - has not won, and only exists because of Facebook’s aforementioned network effects. 3. Instagram - acquired. 4. Quest - acquired. 5. A bunch of other random shit nobody cares about and will never make Meta money. I can pretty much guarantee both FB and Messenger would be just as big as they are now if Facebook had “broken less crap.” Moving fast and breaking shit made working at Meta fun, not necessarily more productive, even if at times it felt more productive to the engineer, since they could push code faster. reply e12e 20 hours agoprevIt's a good mantra - but I'm unsure about this page.

Haste makes waste - British Festina lente - Latin (Make haste slowly) Chi va piano, va sano e va lontano - Italian (Slow and steady wins the race) Slowly but surely - many cultures, probably dates back to hunter gatherers. \"Slow is smooth, smooth is quick, quick is fast\" is the variation I was taught by a military relative.

They all circle a notion we internalize with particular meaning that the words don't ever quite capture, perfectly, but we get the point across. reply singleshot_ 18 hours agorootparentI don’t think it originated in marksmanship, that’s all. I agree marksmen say this and I agree it’s a good strategy for shooting, in addition to other fine motor skills. If you look to your Italian version, it’s quite plausible that the idea originated in racing. Further, I hesitate to call Roman soldiers marksmen although I acknowledge aim is required when using a sword or spear. reply agumonkey 20 hours agorootparentprevI'd add huygens idea of light propagation, waves propagate toward the nicest path to reach a destination, even if it takes an angle. reply apeescape 20 hours agoparentprevAlain Prost* Marcel Proust is the famous writer.

    "originBody": "Pixel smartphones delivered with secret but inactive remote maintenance Pixel smartphones were delivered with remote maintenance software at Verizon's request, worldwide. When activated, it can download unsafe code. Save to Pocket listen Print view Pixel 8 (Image: Gabo_Arts/Shutterstock.com) Aug 15, 2024 at 11:12 pm CEST 4 min. read Security By Marie-Claire Koch This article was originally published in German and has been automatically translated. Millions of Pixel phones have been shipped with remote maintenance software that makes them vulnerable to spyware – but only if the perpetrator has physical access to the device, enters the user's password and knows how to activate the normally invisible and inactive software, according to Google. Under these conditions, an attacker could also install any other software. The remote maintenance software is said to have been installed at Verizon's request since the Pixel phones were launched in 2017. The US mobile operator used the program for a while to demonstrate Pixel phones in its sales outlets. Whether Android phones other than Pixel are also affected is still unclear. Active exploitation is not known. The vulnerability was discovered by the \"Endpoint Detection and Response\" scanner (EDR) von iVerify on a customer's cell phone. iVerify, together with the affected customer Palantir and the security company Trail of Bits, was able to trace this back to a hidden Android software package. Even though the software is no longer used, it is still present in the images of Pixel smartphones, as Trail of Bits CEO Dan Guido notes on X. In fact, firmware images for the Pixel devices can still be downloaded from Google's official servers, which contain the priv-app directory with the aforementioned Showcase.pkg in product.img, as heise online was able to verify using the Android 14.0 image for the Pixel 8a. According to iVerify, once activated, the application downloads a configuration file via an insecure connection, which can result in system-level code being executed. The configuration file is retrieved from a domain hosted by AWS over unsecured HTTP, which leaves the configuration and the device vulnerable to malicious code, spyware and data wiping. Patch not yet available The affected package is pre-installed in the firmware of Pixel devices. By default, the application is not active; however, as it is part of the firmware image, millions of phones could be running this app at system level. Users cannot uninstall Showcase.apk themselves. An update that removes the inactive software is in the works, according to Verizon, and will be made available to \"all affected OEM manufacturers\". This raises the suspicion that phones other than Pixel phones are also equipped with the insecure application. According to media reports, Showcase.apk comes from Smith Micro, a company that provides software for remote access, parental control and data erasure. \"This is neither an Android platform nor a Pixel vulnerability,\" Google told Forbes. The app was developed for a demo function for stores of the US mobile phone provider Verizon, but is no longer in use. Both physical access to the device and the user's password are required to activate the app. The function is no longer used by Verizon, nor by consumers, a company spokesperson told Forbes. Neither iVerify nor Verizon have found any evidence of the vulnerability being exploited. As a precautionary measure, the demo function will be removed from all devices. The discovery of Showcase.apk and similar incidents show the need for greater transparency and discussion around third-party apps that are part of the operating system. Incidentally, the problem is not new - nor is it limited to Pixel smartphones: back in 2016, a person complained to Verizon that a \"Verizon store demo mode app\" was on his Samsung Galaxy Note 5.

The folks over at GrapheneOS have a much better analysis of this whole thing: https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/112967309987371034 reply hn92726819 6 hours agoparentI don't understand why they say you need physical access to the device. The Play Store has access to remotely install apps; surely it can enable them. I'm going to try this today. You can log in to the Play Store on a computer and click \"Install\" and it'll ask you what device you want it on. I'm not saying Graphene has this app, I'm just talking about their claim that physical access is required to enable it on non-Graphene pixels. reply ffsm8 6 hours agorootparentApps don't have root permission and most Apis aren't available until the user accepted a prompt for the permission. And this specific API is likely only possible through adb, though I'm not further informed then this cited thread. Could they change that in a software update? Sure! But they could also just push an update that crypto locks your device unless you pay them a monthly fee. The technology exists to do so, your trusting the OTA update provider not to do so. Just like with every other device you're running updates on, wherever that's your laptop, TV, fridge, smart mirror, speakers, doorbell, lightning or... whatever else has firm- or software in your household that you choose to update, manually or automatically. reply hn92726819 6 hours agorootparent> most Apis aren't available until the user accepted a prompt for the permission True in general, but not true for preinstalled installed. System apps are already granted permissions on a fresh install (for example, Google Play Services has basically every permission, but you were never prompted). Also what I'm describing isn't an update. At runtime, no update or reboot required, you can tell Play to install an app on your phone. Google then tells your phone to install it. I bet the mechanism is the same to enable a disabled app. I do know play store can enable disabled apps, I just don't know if it can be done remotely. Edit: here's proof you can Enable a disabled app: https://storage.googleapis.com/support-forums-api/attachment... Here's proof you can remotely install apps: https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/14274288?hl=en If you put these together, you have this app that can be remotely enabled, contrary to what Graphene is saying. reply ffsm8 5 hours agorootparentNeither of these proofs actually prove anything. The first one has nothing about any disabled apps The second one explicitly states that you're only able to install on your own device. And even if you doubt that... This still won't help you unless the user also opens the application and accepts the pop-up for scary permissions. reply diiidn 5 hours agorootparentprevOkay let's say the app can be enabled remotely by someone other than the user of the phone.

While booting, using either grub or systemd-boot, enter a uefi shell and change the kernel parameters to include 'init=/bin/bash rw'. Boot like that and you'll get a rw root shell.

All you need to do is install to a standard LUKS partition with a good password. Then your data is secure but not irretrievably tied to your motherboard. Granted, that's not UKI, but it's a functional solution. reply jansommer 5 hours agorootparentYes, TPM is just one way to access your disk. The only reason to use it is in my opinion to not have to enter a super long password on every boot. An extra key if your mobo fails is the way to go. Or if you can't boot after an update, and you don't sign your recovery OS with the same key. reply bitwize 9 hours agorootparentprevApple has made significant progress in terms of developing evil-maid-resistant systems. \"No system is secure when you have physical access\" is one of those canards that was true ten or so years ago, but was not an iron law even then and has been falsified by recent developments. Kinda like \"there's no such thing as unbreakable DRM\" in an era when the Xbox DRM is indeed, for all intents and purposes, unbreakable. reply croes 7 hours agorootparentprevI thought we talk about the title and not the article.

The point is that many OSes include tools that you can use to do remote maintenance as long as you have the password and physical access. There's nothing to write home about. There being inactive software somewhere to do maintenance that can be used if you have physical access and the password is as best interesting (curiosity), at worst not newsworthy, and in any case not concerning.

They are not supposed to ship a setup where physical access escalates to permanent spying with no warnings because they are promising things about devices not about an ecosystem's overall functionality to build any possible configuration. Many people feel Google and Apple have ulterior motives, but that is an academic argument unless they abandon this motive, at that point they need to always ship rooted insecure boot phones for our ease of use. reply jdietrich 9 hours agorootparentprev\"Secret\" is the clickbait, as it implies that there's some kind of subterfuge going on. The app isn't intentionally hidden as far as I can tell, so \"preinstalled\" would be far less sensational. Any operating system distro is going to come with a bunch of stuff that you're not necessarily going to use; obviously it's less than ideal if distributions are being shipped with old junk that nobody uses, but it's hardly the crime of the century. reply croes 7 hours agorootparentIt's hidden from the normal user, isn't it? reply throwaway290 8 hours agoparentprevIt's not clickbait.

I downloaded a copy of the app from here, which is the Pixel 8 firmware for June 2024: https://dumps.tadiphone.dev/dumps/google/shiba/-/raw/shiba-u... The app has two components that are exported: - broadcast receiver com.customermobile.preload.StartOnBoot, which receives the ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast that is sent by the system after the device is booted and first unlocked by the user - activity com.customermobile.preload.DebugActivity The onReceive method in StartOnBoot is this: public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) { Log.d(LOG_ID, \"on boot called: \" + (intent != null ? intent.toString() : \"null\")); boolean demoEnabled = getDemoEnabled(context); boolean checkAppPermissions = checkAppPermissions(context); Log.d(LOG_ID, \"demoEnabled: \" + demoEnabled); Log.d(LOG_ID, \"permissionsCheck: \" + checkAppPermissions); if (demoEnabled && checkAppPermissions) { startDemoStub(context); } else { if (!demoEnabled || checkAppPermissions) { return; } startPermissionsCheck(context); } } It relies on the getDemoEnabled method returning true to do anything: public static boolean getDemoEnabled(Context context) { int iStoreDemoMode = 0; int iVzwStoreDemoMode = 0; String szStoreDemoMode; String szVzwStoreDemoMode; try { iStoreDemoMode = Settings.Secure.getInt(context.getContentResolver(), \"store_demo_mode\"); } catch (Exception ignored) {} try { iVzwStoreDemoMode = Settings.Secure.getInt(context.getContentResolver(), \"verizonwireless_store_demo_mode\"); } catch (Exception ignored) {} try { szStoreDemoMode = Settings.Secure.getString(context.getContentResolver(), \"store_demo_mode\"); } catch (Exception ignored) {} try { szVzwStoreDemoMode = Settings.Secure.getString(context.getContentResolver(), \"verizonwireless_store_demo_mode\"); } catch (Exception ignored) {} return (iStoreDemoMode > 0) || (iVzwStoreDemoMode > 0) || \"true\".equalsIgnoreCase(szStoreDemoMode) || \"true\".equalsIgnoreCase(szVzwStoreDemoMode) } Which will only happen if system settings \"store_demo_mode\" or \"verizonwireless_store_demo_mode\" are set to a positive integer or to \"true\". As neither of these are set by default, none of the code behind the startDemoStub method will be executed when the device boots. The DebugActivity layout is as follows, and consists of a single button labelled \"Simulate StartOnBoot\":All this does if clicked is send an intent which will end up at the onReceive of the StartOnBoot receiver: public class DebugActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements View.OnClickListener { public void onCreate(Bundle bundle) { super.onCreate(bundle); setContentView(R.layout.activity_debug); findViewById(R.id.startOnBoot).setOnClickListener(this); } public void onClick(View view) { if (view.getId() == R.id.startOnBoot) { sendStartOnBootIntent(); } } private void sendStartOnBootIntent() { sendBroadcast(new Intent(\"com.customermobile.preload.StartOnBoot\"), \"com.customermobile.preload.StartOnBoot.PERMISSION\"); } } We know this because the receiver filters for this action: So, nothing to worry about. The app does nothing unless one of the two system settings described above are set. reply trompetenaccoun 7 hours agoparentWhy was this installed on all their devices in the first place? I have nothing to do with Verizon, I've never even been to the US. This is something to worry about because all it takes is someone having access to your unlocked device. For example a border guard demanding to have a look at something. When the user doesn't know this vulnerability exists, it's a problem. It's a company making remote access software. Who honestly wants this pre-installed on their devices? They can install their malware on their own phones, after having purchased them. reply TheDong 4 hours agorootparentWhy is it there? Hanlon's razor, incompetence. What if a border guard has access to your _unlocked phone_ and can re-anable an app? It would be easier for the border guard to instead \"adb install government-spyware-app.apk\" than to enable some weird third-party app that they don't even control the management servers to. If your threat model includes an adversary having access to your unlocked device, the least of your problems are apps like this. reply anvilspoke 6 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn't do anything though. The \"store_demo_mode\" and \"verizonwireless_store_demo_mode\" settings are not set by default, and there doesn't appear to be any way to set these through the UI. Also, according to other comments, the app is disabled by default. From examining the CarrierSettings app, this does indeed appear to be the case. It seems to require a certain carrier configuration to enable it. Anyone who wants to enable the functionality of this app would have to go to some effort to do so, including enabling the Developer Settings - which requires the user's PIN, password or pattern - and then connecting to the device over ADB, enabling the app (if not already enabled by the carrier), and changing one of the two settings above. This really is nothing to worry about. If you disagree, do please feel free to do some analysis of the software yourself so we can discuss this based on the facts. reply tropicalfruit 9 hours agoprev\"spyware contains spyware\" any phone when idle and seemingly \"off\" is doing all kinds of things and sending all kinds of info that you may not consent to if you were aware. i dont even trust the wifi off and airplane mode anymore. they are all liars. reply homero 10 hours agoprev [–] So what?

    "originBody": "Ditch Banks — Go With Money Market Funds and Treasuries August 7, 2024 by Harry Sit in Banking and Credit Cards 34 Comments Keywords: CD, money market fund, savings account, simplicity, Treasury bills Banks and credit unions offer savings accounts and CDs. Brokers such as Vanguard, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab offer money market funds and Treasuries. They serve similar purposes at a high level. Both a savings account and a money market fund allow flexible deposits and withdrawals. Both CDs and Treasuries offer a fixed interest rate for a fixed term.Banks and Credit Unions Brokers Flexible Deposits and Withdrawals High Yield Savings Account Money Market Fund Fixed Term CDs Treasuries While most discussions on these products from banks and brokers center around having FDIC insurance or not (see No FDIC Insurance – Why a Brokerage Account Is Safe), many people don’t realize that there’s a fundamental difference between the roles banks and brokers play. I mentioned this difference in my Guide to Money Market Fund & High Yield Savings Account. It’s worth highlighting it again. The fundamental difference is that banks and credit unions offer a two-party private contract while a broker serves as an intermediary between you and the public market. Two-Party Private Contract A two-party private contract means anything goes as long as one party makes the other party agree to the terms. If a bank gets you to agree to a 0.04% rate in a savings account or a 0.05% rate in a 10-month CD (these are actual current rates from a large bank), that’s what you’ll get regardless of what the rate should be. The bank sets the rate. They don’t need to justify it. You get a bad contract if you aren’t aware of the going rate. A bad contract doesn’t have to be this obvious. It’s been over a year now since the Fed raised the short-term interest rates above 5%. The rate on a “good” online high-yield savings account such as the one from Ally Bank is currently 4.2% while a money market fund pays 5% or more. It’s 4.2% from the bank only because the bank says so. You’re paying a “familiarity penalty” when you stay with Ally. I’m not picking on Ally specifically. It works the same at Marcus, Synchrony, Amex, Discover, Capital One, or Barclays. Ken Tumin, the founder of DepositAccounts.com, made this observation in April 2024: The well-established online banks are also benefiting from customer inertia. Their online savings account rates are about 100 bps under what you can get from MMFs, T-bills and the top OSAs. https://t.co/n6p4DNr93e — Ken Tumin (@KenTumin) April 14, 2024 If you take a step back and ask why banks can benefit from customer inertia in the first place, you realize that’s the nature of a two-party private contract. Customers must take the initiative to break out of a bad contract. Some banks play tricks by offering a new savings account under a different name with competitive rates while keeping the rate low on the existing savings accounts. The rate is low on the existing account only because that’s the contract you agreed to. The bank isn’t obligated to move you to the new program because that’s not in the contract. Nor does the bank have to tell you that you can switch to the new program to get a higher rate. It’s up to you to find out and take action. Rates at many large credit unions aren’t any better. I’m a member of a well-regarded credit union. It’s the largest credit union in the country by far, with three times the assets of the second-largest credit union. The rate on its savings account is 1.5% when you have $50,000 in the account. That’s 3.5% lower than the yield in a money market fund. A good contract today can turn into a bad contract tomorrow. How the contract will change is in the contract itself. A bank offers 5.0% APY on a 13-month CD today. That’s an OK rate but what happens after 13 months? You agree in the contract it will automatically renew to a 12-month CD at a rate set by the bank at that time unless you take specific actions to stop it within a short window. Guess what rate the bank will set on its 12-month CD? Almost always a bad one. It works this way because you agreed to the contract. When you have a two-party private contract, your interest is in direct conflict with the other party in the contract. The onus is on you to know whether the contract is good or bad. It’s on you to watch when a good contract turns into a bad contract. Caveat emptor. You’ll have to jump from contract to contract if you don’t want to get stuck in a bad contract. Some people are more alert in monitoring and jumping. They have a chance to “beat the market” but they pay for it with a heavy mental workload and time spent on opening new accounts and closing old accounts. Many fail to be vigilant at some point. They start paying the “familiarity penalty” because it’s too tiring otherwise. Market Intermediary A broker acts as an intermediary. They get you the market rate and take a cut. A broker doesn’t set the rate. The market does. The broker only sets its cut. A money market fund gets you the market rate on money market securities minus the cut by the fund manager. Some fund managers take a bigger cut than others but the difference between major players is much smaller and more stable than the difference between rates offered by different banks and credit unions. If you use a money market fund with the smallest cut, such as one from Vanguard, you almost guarantee you’ll have the best rate in a money market fund at all times. You still pay a “familiarity penalty” when you use a money market fund from Fidelity or Schwab versus one from Vanguard but the difference is in the 0.2%-0.3% range whereas the “familiarity penalty” in bank savings accounts can be more than 1%. The “familiarity penalty” is zero or negligible in buying Treasuries through Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard. Treasuries don’t trick you into renewing at a bad rate. They automatically pay out at maturity. You’ll get the market rate when you buy again. If the broker offers the “auto roll” feature and you enable it at your choice, your Treasuries will automatically renew at the market rate. You can rest assured that you won’t be cheated. Money market funds and Treasuries paid very little when the Fed kept interest rates at zero and ran several rounds of Quantitative Easing a few years ago. That wasn’t money market funds’ fault or brokers’ fault. Those were the market rates at that time. Like investing in index funds, you give up the dream of “beating the market” when you put your money in money market funds and Treasuries but you also consistently get the market rates at all times. It doesn’t require keeping your guard up, monitoring carefully, or jumping. If you want to consistently earn a good yield with low maintenance, ditch banks and credit unions. If you normally keep money in a savings account at a bank or a credit union, put the money in a money market fund at a broker. Here are some choices at Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab:Vanguard Fidelity Schwab Default VMFXX SPAXX None Higher yield, higher riskSPRXX or FZDXX SWVXX Higher quality, higher state tax-exemption VUSXX FDLXX SNSXX Select Money Market Funds at Major Retail Brokers These are good starting points. You can find more money fund choices in Which Vanguard Money Market Fund Is the Best at Your Tax Rates, Which Fidelity Money Market Fund Is the Best at Your Tax Rates, and Which Schwab Money Market Fund Is the Best at Your Tax Rates. If you normally buy a CD from a bank or a credit union, buy a Treasury of the same term at Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. See How To Buy Treasury Bills & Notes Without Fee at Online Brokers and How to Buy Treasury Bills & Notes On the Secondary Market. I used to have many accounts with banks and credit unions. I have only $60 in bank accounts now. My cash is in money market funds and Treasuries in a Fidelity brokerage account. Credit card bills automatically debit Fidelity on the due date. Fidelity automatically sells a money market fund to cover the debits. See 2 Ways to Use Fidelity as a Bank Account. The Fed has signaled that they may lower interest rates soon. I don’t think they will cut rates all the way back to zero again. If one day banks and credit unions start paying more on their savings accounts and CDs than money market funds and Treasuries, which I doubt will happen, I will still stick to money market funds and Treasuries because I like the transparency and fairness. I’d rather get the market rate at all times than count on the benevolence of a bank or a credit union.

If I put £100 in a savings account with 4% interest, I can withdraw that £100 (plus interest) at any time. If I buy put £100 into government bonds with 4% yield and I check back in a year's time, if bond yields have increased (say, due to increased base rate) then the \"balance\" I can withdraw is _less_ than £100, since the underlying bond is less valuable! Putting money in bonds exposes you to market volatility, which banks shield you from (which is why they get to take a cut) Edit: a money market fund appears to absorb this volatility for you by balancing their bond portfolio, but ultimately you are still relying on the fund being well managed. The failure mode here isn't the govt not paying the coupon on the bond - it's the fund not having the liquidity to pay you if you withdraw. I don't understand enough how money markets are regulated to understand the risk, whereas banks are required to have deposit insurance in UK & US. reply vladd 15 hours agoparentSince bonds are always reaching their promised payout terms upon their maturity, you can manage that risk through proper alignment in maturity dates. You can purchase multiple bonds that are spread around their term duration. E.g. buy now 1-year bonds, and repeat every 3 months. After 4 such cycles, you will now always have bonds reaching maturity every 3 months. Or just buy shorter term ones to begin with (if the interest is still appealing), and move to longer term ones once you have enough maturity diversity for the advice in the previous paragraph. reply koliber 12 hours agorootparentThis works if you never need to liquidate early. For most people such a need to get their cash out occasionally happens. Regardless of how you stagger your bonds, if you need to sell before maturity, there is a chance they will be worth less. reply thanksgiving 10 hours agorootparentThe only money if buy a bond with is money I'd put in a certificate of deposit (CD) anyway. reply nly 8 hours agorootparentprevYou can sell gilts early. There's just a chance of a small loss. Unlikely ATM while rates are expected to fall. reply FooBarBizBazz 6 hours agorootparentprevBond ladders are almost exactly the same as CD ladders. Bonds and CDs are almost exactly the same thing, mathematically. The tax treatment is a tiny bit different. T-bill interest is exempt from state/local tax. CD interest is not. Default risk is the tiniest bit different, but not by much. With the CD, there is some probability that the bank will fail, at which point you then need to wait for the gears of the FDIC to slowly turn to pay you your CD insurance. The FDIC actually doesn't have that much money, so in a sufficiently large bank run the Federal Reserve will have to backstop it. On the other hand, you can just buy a T-bill directly from the Treasury, which is also backstopped by the Fed. So there are some additional middlemen in the case of the CD. Maybe that's good -- more failures in a row are necessary before you get to the Fed. Maybe that's bad -- there are more parties and more bureaucracy involved in the unlikely event of a bank failure. I think you might as well go straight to the Treasury for the high rate and better tax treatment. (Or I'd plow it into the S&P 500 because T-bills ain't never gonna outpace inflation, no matter what they say the numbers are.) reply firsthummus 15 hours agoparentprevIt should be clarified that the advice is to purchase short-dated Treasuries, which have negligible exposure to short term volatility (and are typically the place people park money in times of distress). Also, an important note is that none of the major banks in the US pay 4% or anywhere near that amount on deposits. Think 0.01%. Long term bonds, as you correctly point out are extremely sensitive to changes in interest rates. In the current (rather unusual) situation, where deposits pay nothing and short term Treasuries pay reasonably well, this advice is sound. reply stouset 13 hours agorootparent> none of the major banks in the US Literally all you have to do is just stop using shitty megabanks. It isn’t even hard. reply kevin_thibedeau 14 hours agorootparentprevYou can get 4+% at US online banks. Short term CDs have been over 5% for the past year. You have to skip the brick and mortar banks with high overhead. reply js2 13 hours agorootparentAlly Savings right now is 4.2%. Their high-yield 6 month CD is 5%. Both are subject to state and federal income tax. FDLXX 7-day yield is 4.93%. 99.5% exempt from state income tax. The most recent 4-week treasury is 5.24%. Exempt from state income tax. There is very very slightly more risk in the FDLXX MMF than a savings account. I started using Fidelity as my primary \"bank\" years ago and haven't looked back. reply silisili 12 hours agorootparentSame. I'll admit I didn't want to, because I hate their dated website and app so much.

Fidelity has too many things I like to split between two brokerages. Using 4-week treasuries on auto-roll is close enough to VUSXX for me. You really can't go wrong with Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab if all you need is a brokerage. But Fidelity has a much broader set of products that it offers compared to Vanguard. https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Fidelity:_one_stop_shop reply silisili 2 hours agorootparentprevThat's if you're only judging by APY. Vanguard has an atrocious app, and is missing many 'bank-like' features that Fidelity provides - I've enumerated some in a sibling comment. I don't think Vanguard even has a debit card, unless that's changed recently. reply Slix 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat kind of features? reply silisili 2 hours agorootparentHigh APY ( ~5% ). Keep in mind this is a MM account that works exactly like checking. I don't have to worry about the money in it - don't have to reinvest money earned myself or sell to spend money - it's all transparent. When you spend money, it works, and you'll just see it removed from your MM balance. I mention this because Schwab has a similar account, but makes you manually buy and sell holdings instead as needed. In above account, you can also make selections here to not need to pay state tax on earnings, but that doesn't apply to me anyways. Nice for people in high tax states, though. Paper checks in a checkbook. This is something you'd assume is standard but actually hard to find at online banks today. Debit card with ATM fee rebates worldwide. I don't travel worldwide much anymore, but there's only 3 or 4 banks total that do this and it's a nicety. Instant P2P between accounts. I often send my wife money for various reasons. This is another one that's surprisingly not standard at a lot of banks. Free same day wires. Very straightforward, no hassles here, though I've only used it three times. Customer Service. When you call them, someone in the US answers within a few seconds. They'll talk investing with you, goals, or general troubleshooting things. They also call to check in about twice a year which I find annoying, but some people might like it. Money guarantee. Luckily I haven't had to use this yet, but any money stolen from hackers/fraud is supposedly 100% covered by Fidelity. reply cagey 6 hours agorootparentprevOne feature I found rather unique at Fidelity (I too have recently migrated there as my \"one stop shop\") was free outgoing domestic wires ($100 minimum). Being able to \"teleport\" money within an hour to another pre-registered account (before 3PM ET on biz days, in my experience) facilitated switching to Fidelity while still keeping old bank/CU accounts minimally active without having to engage in a lot of thinking ahead about balances (and worrying about EFT/ACH hold times) at those now peripheral accounts. reply chomp 13 hours agorootparentprev> none of the major banks in the US pay 4% I'm getting 4.4% with Apple. reply loeg 13 hours agorootparentYeah, but money market funds pay 5.2% or whatever. reply tompccs 15 hours agorootparentprevif savings rates in the UK were as bad as they seem to be in the US then I admit I would be tempted. However, a shock at the wrong time can cause those \"safe\" T-bills to suddenly be much less than what was paid for them.

In a T-BILL only fund even a decrease in past asset value doesn't matter because they are by law managed to 1$ of net asset value. That is they most hold 1$ of _current_ asset value for every 1$ deposited _at all times_. The only situation where the value of the fund can be less than what you put in is the collapse of US currency, which savings account insurance can not protect against either. reply tivert 12 hours agorootparent> The only situation where the value of the fund can be less than what you put in is the collapse of US currency, which savings account insurance can not protect against either. I don't think so: suppose the company offering the fund was mismanaged and failed to comply with the regulations. Maybe not likely, but definitely more likely than the \"collapse of US currency.\" reply zbobet2012 3 hours agorootparentSure, but you are most likely using these funds as core positions in an account which is SPIC covered to 500k.

Supposing it is a 1 year bond, if you hold it for the full year you get your £100 back. If you need to sell early, then you might get less back if rates have risen. A money market fund operates differently from holding individual bonds and aims to provide you with the ability to sell at any time without a loss --- but the monthly interest paid out will fluctuate according to market rates. reply vegabook 10 hours agoparentprevThe whole idea of the yield curve is that you (generally) get compensated for that risk with higher rates. That is why (outside of crises) the yield curve is upward sloping. It follows that if you buy shorter dated T-bills or bonds, the liquidation loss risk you mention is low, and you’ll still usually make out better than with the bank because you’re not paying any middleman. reply skybrian 11 hours agoparentprevIf you prefer to buy something FDIC insured, you can buy CD’s through your brokerage.

Convenience is easily worth it. reply FooBarBizBazz 7 hours agoparentprevThe distinction to make isn't between CDs and bonds. They're actually just-about identical instruments. The key issue is the duration of the bond or CD. Longer duration bonds (and CDs!) expose you to more interest rate risk. If you buy and then rates go up, then nobody will want to accept your bond/CD on the secondary market at the old face value; you'll need to sell it for less, so the rate they get from it is on par with the new prevailing one. With CDs some of these dynamics are more hidden, because most people cannot access a secondary market for their CDs and do not see what they are worth on a given day. They just hold to maturity. But -- -- you can also just hold a bond to maturity, and -- if you buy your bank CD through a brokerage account (e.g. Fidelity, Schwab), then you can sell it early on the secondary market, for whatever a buyer will accept. So there's less difference between bonds and CDs than people suppose. (There is also the issue of default risk when the issuer of the bond is a private company or untrustworthy government. But I would say that US Treasuries and FDIC-backed CDs have similar low default risk, and you can make an argument that the T-bill is actually safer.) reply esaym 1 hour agoparentprevlol, my bank's rate is 0.3% on savings account. reply globular-toast 11 hours agoparentprevBut when you withdraw that £100 it will be worth less due to inflation.

Many brokerages, like Fidelity (their “Cash Management Account”) let you write checks, send ACH, or send wire’s directly from the brokerage. They even have a debit card. It also has an account number that you can use to pay bills, it’s exposed by fidelity as a “checking” account type. For me, Fidelity IS my bank for daily life. I only go to a physical bank like chase / bank of america if I need to deposit cash, or i need to withdraw a lot of cash. reply pishpash 15 hours agorootparentFor daily life yes, for large amounts of money, the extra layer due to not being a real bank makes a huge difference. reply wenc 15 hours agorootparent> large amounts of money, the extra layer due to not being a real bank makes a huge difference. Can I ask why? reply pishpash 15 hours agorootparentYou need to get the money to an actual bank, an extra hop is just extra delay and cause for problems. See links to examples of failed wire transfer below. reply wenc 12 hours agorootparentIn theory correct because large sums of money wired out of an account can be subject to holds for any number of reasons. But it’s the same with banks too. The only difference is there is one fewer party in the transaction to trace (whereas Fidelity has to work with UMB which is their bank partner). But the probability of a hold is the same, which is usually very low. I’ve been with Fidelity for over a decade now and have never had large transactions held. reply pishpash 10 hours agorootparentWire transfer is not really the point. It became a topic because that was posed as an \"instant\" way to get money out of a brokerage. I pointed out it isn't always reliable and that unreliability is a symptom of a real liquidity difference. The point is that if I demanded money from you, you can give me your money out of a bank immediately, simply by walking into one. You cannot get money out of a brokerage account for me. You need it transferred for you to a bank first before it becomes your money. This is an actual difference to me who wants money from you now and it's not in theory. reply wenc 2 hours agorootparentThat’s a fair point. I guess for me it’s extremely rare for me to need (large amounts of) money “now” apart from daily needs but that’s usually charged to my credit card and paid off from my Fidelity cash management account on an interval. I can see in emergency situations where that is true. But the currently level of liquidity that I get with brokerage accounts + cash management account works for 99.99% of my use cases. I’m willing to take the higher interest in MMF for what is a negligible impact to liquidity for my use cases. reply ac29 12 hours agorootparentprevYou can spend directly out of a money market fund at Fidelity. Yes, there is a bank involved in some transactions behind the scenes, but there is no delay and no extra step to take by the customer. reply lurking_swe 15 hours agorootparentprevwhat do you recommend then? To transfer large amounts to my personal bank via ACH, and then perform a wire from my physical bank? reply pishpash 11 hours agorootparentKeep some funds in a marginable brokerage account attached to a major bank, one with physical locations. That way if you really need funds immediately during banking hours you're good to go. reply toomuchtodo 16 hours agoparentprevI can wire funds from my cash management or brokerage account for free, use the debit card for anything that takes debit payment rails, etc. I do keep a Chase account around for Zelle, but am looking to switch to Navy Federal Credit Union to eliminate Chase but retain Zelle until FedNow uptake improves. Wires to my Wise account land super fast for quick cross border money movement to EUR and AUD. Wise only charges $1-$2 for domestic US wires, so also convenient for funds that need immediate availability elsewhere. (lots of detail that might be potentially unhelpful, but I hope it helps others, the plumbing is easy if you know the primitives; Chase is horrible, I do not recommend, Schwab, Vanguard, or Fidelity is the way) reply pishpash 15 hours agorootparentWire can easily get held up for unknown amounts of time with no recourse. A brokerage attached to a real bank is the only liquid solution for large amounts. Everything else is on an ACH timeframe, which is usually next day with push, but that's often not good enough when you actually need large amounts of money. reply dghlsakjg 14 hours agorootparentAny bank can do this.

But after you become a US person, you have far more choices. Usually, transfer is also more difficult with a brokerage than a bank; correct me if I was wrong: a) brokerage follows a previous T+3 settlement, now T+1, some banks offer a faster settlement, especially if Zelle is directly available; and b) while doing international wire, the bank is considered a viable target, but brokerage don't, a broker has to use their account opened at a bank, it could be cheaper, but there is more hassle (e.g., some government would allow this for non-business purpose).

To put that into perspective, a floppy disk from the before times could hold 1.44 MB, enough to fit over 100 JS13K games! In 2021 the contest celebrated its 10th annual event. The theme was “Space” and there were an impressive 223 games submitted. It was my third year participating in the contest. That was a few years ago and I am back now to share with you the story of how my entry was made. Better late then never! My game, “Space Huggers” is a run and gun roguelike platformer with procedurally generated environments and a pixel art style. I was inspired by games like Broforce, Metal Slug, and Contra. The engine was written from scratch in pure JavaScript and has since been open sourced under the name LittleJS. It’s a great little engine with many nice features packed into a tiny footprint with clean well documented code. In this post I will explain how my game works and the design process I went through while developing it. We will not go into detail about the code here, but it’s all available on GitHub for you to check out. Also, there is now an improved version on Newgrounds with some bonus features like medals, a final boss fight, and even support for mobile devices. Space Huggers – JS13K entry Space Huggers – Enhanced Version Making Tiny Games For several years I’ve been studying the strange art of writing tiny programs. Back in 2019, after a long career in mainstream games, I found myself somewhat burnt out from working with giant code bases. I wanted to get back to basics and try something radically different. So on a whim I decided to make a tiny ski game in C++ and found it to be one of the most fun experiences of my career. Thirsty for more I stumbled across the JS1k competition which happened to already be in progress. I knew immediately that I needed to participate, so learned JavaScript on the fly. After 2 weeks and a few all-nighters, I submitted 6 demos to the contest. It was clear, I was hooked on writing tiny code! Over the next the few years I honed my JavaScript skills by making games, tools, art, and other experiments. On a website called Dwitter I released over a thousand tiny programs that push the boundaries of a 140 character limitation. I also released a few longform generative art projects using only vanilla JavaScript. All this was drastically different from what I had been doing for the past 20 years while programming in C++ at major game studios, but it fees like I finally discovered my true calling. Enter JS13K In subsequent years I’ve entered JS13K several times. The first time I received 2nd place with a Bounce Back, my Link’s Awakening homage, which also has a lengthy writeup. The next year NoteCraft, my cellular automata music creator, won both the Audio and Innovation categories. That same year I released OS13k, a tiny JavaScript operating system that won the Super Special award given by the organizer of the contest. I open sourced OS13k on GitHub and have continuing adding apps to it. My most recent entry to JS13k was in 2022 when I submitted Egg Time Rewind. This time I wanted to take things to the next level, by building a new game engine suitable for high quality low size games. There are already some tools of this sort available, like Kontra and Tiny-Canvas, but none with extensive feature set I required. So when the contest started on August 13th, my first step was to make the engine before I could begin working on a game. Building The Engine This primary goal of this engine is to be as small as possible while delivering the most powerful features. Using what I learned from making Bounce Back, I reworked everything to create even tighter and cleaner code. I eventually released the engine on GitHub as LittleJS with an open source license and still continue to improve it. At its core, the engine uses an object oriented architecture that’s easy to build games with. For graphics it uses WebGL to render a massive amount of sprites at 60 FPS. The audio system uses ZzFX to procedurally create stereo sound effects. The input system handles keyboard, mouse, touch, and analog gamepads. I even wrote a small 2D physics system and collision solver. I have talked a lot about LittleJS before so we won’t go into details here but it took a long time to get all that working. About half the contest had flown by before I was ready to move on to any real game design or art. Game Design The run-and-gun genera doesn’t get as much love now as it did when I was growing up. I’m not sure why games like Contra and Metal Slug have declined in popularity. Maybe because first person shooters and metroidvania style games overtook the genre. Still, occasionally there are a few gems that get the formula right. One of my favorites is Broforce by Free Lives. Broforce by Free Lives The original Broforce came out in 2015 and has since seen many updates and ports to consoles, I highly recommend giving it a go. You may not know that the original Broforce prototype was made in only one weekend for the Ludum Dare game jam under the title Rambros. To gather research for my game I spent a few hours playing both Broforce and the original demo while taking copious notes. I would need to distill this concept down to its core in order to pack as much gameplay as possible into the size limit. I decided to use procedurally generated levels to save space and add replay value. Instead of adding a lot of extra content, I focused on creating fun and polished core gameplay. To give myself an extra challenge, I wanted this game to support up to 4 player cooperative play, a first for JS13K! Art and Animation Because space is so limited, designing the art requires careful thought and planning. With most modern games, the art takes up a significant portion of the storage space. For this game I wanted to mimic the look of classic 16-bit games, so it uses a pixel art style sprite sheet. Most tiles are 16×16 pixels in size with a few smaller 8×8 tiles. Some of the tiles are gray so color can be applied at run time. Limiting the number of colors also allows the image to be compressed better. The entire sprite sheet is only a 16 color 128×48 image as seen here… When designing the sprites for my game I looked at the sprite sheet for Broforce as a guide to help understand the character art. Broforce actually has a ton of sprites and animation frames, but I was able to distill it down to just two frames of animation for everything! This includes standing, running, jumping, climbing ladders, flipping, rolling, and dying. For some of those actions like rolling the sprite is rotated to animate it without requiring any extra art. Sprite comparison In my sprite sheet the heads are separate from the body. That allows the characters to have procedural animation with the body bobbing up and down during the run cycle. The player’s eyes are also animated procedurally and will randomly blink to make the character seem more alive. When the player dies the sprite closes its eyes and rolls over sideways. It’s kind of dramatic! The level art is also created using tiles from the sprite sheet with random coloring applied. This includes both the outside ground and enemy bases interiors. Outlines around the level geometry are added procedurally to make the edges stand out and give a more polished look. By combining all these elements together, it is possible to do a lot with a little! Player Design For the look of the player character I wanted something alien but humanoid. The colors were chosen to contrast with each other and pop out from the background so the sprite is visible as possible. I always try to make gender neutral player characters so it’s easier for more people to identify with. After experimenting with different concepts I settled on a design only slightly inspired by Greedo from Star Wars. I was surprised how many people called me out on it! The game design for the player was informed by retro platformers like Mario, Contra, and some modern indies like Broforce. Something I love is how these games have single hit kills but also abundant extra lives, it makes for really exciting gameplay. Because my game is essentially an action roguelike, I made sure to supply the player with a variety of abilities to get out of any situation they find themselves stuck in. Squaresville for Sifteo Cubes The player has a classic platformer movement package including the ability to break blocks and climb walls by jumping. All of the physics code was written from scratch for this game. I used a similar physics solution to the system I developed in 2013 for Sifteo Cubes. One of the toughest things to implement was the way ladders are interacted with. After the end of the contest I had to submit an emergency fix because of a glitch allowing the player to pass into collision by jumping into a ladder from the wrong angle! The player also has a multi functional roll ability that provides a boost of speed and brief window of invulnerability. It has many uses including dodging bullets, double jumping, putting out fires, and knocking out enemies. This roll recharges after only a few seconds with a little flash so the player notices that it’s available again. The primary weapon is a gun that not only kills most enemies in one hit but also destroys objects and level geometry. It has limited range so players will need to get in close to hit anything. For a little extra fun players also has 3 grenades that denotate with a large explosion destroying, pushing away, and lighting everything on fire. It’s a fun way to soften up a room! Enemy Design The enemies all use the same base code as the player, so their AI works more like a bot then a typical videogame enemy. At a high level they send control inputs to the shared character class the same way as the player. This approach allows for interesting and complex combat encounters while reducing how much code is needed. The pixel art for the enemies was inspired by the Spartans in the Halo series. I thought it would be fun to subvert the concept space marines by making it about aliens fighting to defend their home planets against a military invasion. All of the enemy types use the same sprite but with a different tint and visor color to differentiate them. There are 5 enemy types, from easiest to most difficult… Recruit (Green) – A bit shorter then normal, hesitant to attack, dies in one hit. Soldier (Blue) – Average height and ability, takes 2 hits to kill. Captain (Red) – Can climb walls and jumps more often, takes 3 hits. Specialist (White) – Jumps and rolls often like ninjas, takes 4 hits. Demolitions Expert (Purple) – Throws grenades and can’t catch on fire, takes 5 hits! There is also a small chance of any enemy type being spawned as heavy weapons variation. These mini boss enemies are larger with double health and shoot in fully automatic mode. The enemy AI uses a pretty complex state machine since they can do all the same actions as the player. In addition to patrol and search behaviors, they will also engage in some surprisingly varied combat maneuvers. Giving each enemy type a unique theme helped inform me about how to design their AI. I love making enemies that can keep the player on their toes! Object Design One of my favorite things about playing games is causing unexpected chain reactions. This kind of emergent behavior is often facilitated by a fire propagation system, something I’ve implemented in many games before like Psi-Ops which I worked on at Midway Games. This time I streamlined the design to use only a few objects that combine to create complex behaviors and fun scenarios. Some of these objects are able to catch on fire, and send heat events to nearby objects, eventually catching them on fire. Other objects are able to explode which damages and pushes away nearby objects while also setting more things on fire. There’s even a water barrel that can put out fires! All of these objects use only 3 sprites: a crate, a barrel, and a rock. By using different tints and additive colors it’s possible to represent many different types of objects… Wooden Crate (Brown) – Burns easily and breaks when fully burnt. Metal Crate & Barrel (Gray) – Hard to destroy and can’t burn. Explosive Crate & Barrel (Green) – Burns and explodes after a few seconds. High Explosive Barrel (Red) – Explodes quicker with a larger radius than normal explosives. Water Barrel (Blue) – Puts out fires and pushes away objects. Rock (Grayish) – Heavy and very hard to destroy, can’t burn, and crush enemies. Lava Rock (Glowing Orange) – Anything it touches is lit on fire! Extra Game Design The only other game object that the player interacts with are checkpoint flags that can be activated just by touching them. This system allows players to respawn closer to the action when they die. The flag also has a special function in co-op multiplayer mode because when a player dies, the remaining players need to get to a checkpoint to respawn their buddies. The final thing I squeezed into this game was a radar system that appears along the bottom of the screen. It’s a simple but effective way to show where all the enemies are in relation to the player. I added it after experiencing some frustration while tracking down the last few enemies! Level Design The levels are procedurally generated so they are different for every playthrough. This can be a great way to cut down on file size for JS13K while also giving players an unlimited amount of content to explore. The real trick is generating levels that are interesting and fun for players. To give structure to the level design, there are enemy bases composed of different rooms that follow a specific set of rules. This includes both the level geometry as well as placement of enemies and objects. It is probably the most complex part of the game and I was very proud of the result with some super interesting procedurally generated levels. This is definitely something I want to experiment more with in the future. The bases include some special things like partially transparent windows that allow the background to show through and energy doors that can be shot to break them open. To create extra variation the bases are sometimes made to look like caves and underground mines. The ground around the bases uses a random noise algorithm. A few deep chasms are also created that allow enemies or the player to fall to their doom. Checkpoints are placed across the map at roughly regular intervals. Background Effects In the background there’s a layered sky system. The parallax mountainscapes are generated using an algorithm I’ve been working on that creates interesting looking landscapes with just a tiny bit of code. Behind that is a gradient with stars and suns that move in the sky to help emphasize the otherworldly feeling of being on another planet. Some levels even have precipitation effects like rain and snow. This is a great way to demonstrate the particle system and collision physics. More importantly it adds a layer of atmosphere to the game that helps each level feel like a more unique and interesting place. Sound Design All of the audio is played using my open source sound effect tool ZzFX. It’s a tiny self contained sound effect player that generates audio samples from a set of 20 parameters. I was happy to see that many other JS13K games used ZzFX that year including 5 of the top 10 games! In total Space Huggers uses 11 different sound effects and it took a lot of tweaking to get those sounding right. My favorite sound in the game is the footstep sound used by the player. To achieve an atmospheric sound when there is wind or rain, a quiet noisy effect plays every few seconds, overlapping itself with some randomness. I was inspired to give this a shot after hearing it done in another great JS13K game, The Wandering Wraith by Mateusz Tomczyk. Making a Build System This is the first year that I fully automated my build process and it was well worth the effort. Previously there were too many manual steps necessary to build the final zipped project. This was especially a problem towards the end of the jam, when the size gets near the limit and it becomes necessary to build more often to check the final size. My build system is nothing fancy. I just made a windows bat file, but in the click of a button it does the everything I need… Combines all js files together. Runs Google Closure, Uglify, and Roadroller on the code. Combines the minified code into a single html file. Zips the html with ECT. For projects of this size I don’t do a lot of hand minification but instead rely on tools like Google Closure so the source code can remain clean and easy to work with. Though I’ve found Closure to be the best first pass minifier, running Terser or Uglify seemed to squeeze out a few more bytes. Overall I’ve been very impressed at how good Closure is at removing dead code while minifying everything else. That same year Kang Seonghoon introduced a new tool called Roadroller that was a total game changer. It uses a neural network to pack JavaScript code significantly better into a zip file, enough to fit several more kilobytes of code! At first it doesn’t seem possible, but I can assure you, it works like magic. People started joking that JS13K has now become JS15K. This kind of thing really makes me wonder what else will be possible in future years of the contest. This was my first time using Efficient Compression Tool (ECT) to zip a project. After experimenting with various other options I found it to be the most efficient at both zipping files and compressing images. You’d be surprised how many extra bytes of cruft are in an average zip! For large files it probably doesn’t matter much but for small files like this it can make a huge difference. Areas for Improvement After submitting the game I already knew there were some things that could have been done better. In general my game was just very thin on content and lacked an overall sense of progression. There was no end to the game or even a proper beginning. While what I had was very fun, it was also super minimal and felt more like a tech demo then a complete game. One of the biggest features I would have cut is 4 player cooperative gameplay and probably all gamepad support as well. While multiplayer can be a lot of fun, almost no one actually gave it a try which means all that code was just wasted space. I wanted to fit in a variety of weapons and upgrades for the player which would have added a lot of fun and variety to the gameplay. These could also have been used by enemies to create more diverse combat scenarios. I chose to cut this not only for space limitations but also because keeping things simple allowed me to polish everything before the deadline. Unfortunately I was also not able to fit any music, things were just so tight. This is a huge missed opportunity to inject another layer of immersion and I definitely plan to have some kind of soundtrack in my next JS13K game! The Results Space Huggers did not win JS13K but it did pretty well, placing 8th out of 223 games in total. It also received 2nd place in fun and gameplay categories! Additionally Space Huggers was picked by 2 experts as their favorite JS13K game! Thanks so much Lee and Christer. Here’s what they had to say… “As someone who’s sunk hours into Broforce and loves retro games, Space Huggers checked all the boxes for me. Procedurally generated levels that I can play in my browser?!? SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!” – Lee Reilly “It is an impressive game engine AND an extremely fun game! Most things are one or the other.” – Christer Kaitila Possibly the most amazing thing of all is that we got a half page writeup in Linux Format magazine! It’s beyond awesome to see my game showing up in print media. Newgrounds Enhanced Edition After JS13K I took some time to polish up the game a little more and released it on Newgrounds. I also reworked the length of the game so it can beaten in around 10 minutes. Here are some of the new features I added to this enhanced version… Limited game to 5 levels with the final level being the smallest but most dense. Final boss that can crash through walls and throws objects at the player. Intro screen with a music track I composed using FL Studio. Mobile support with a virtual on screen touch gamepad. Medals and Scoreboard with the fastest times. Many other small tweaks and improvements. I am proud to say that the game now has over 100K plays on Newgrounds and maintains a solid 4/5 score with over 600 votes! Also, there are 26 pages of comments from people that have reviewed the game. This feedback was a great way for me to continue improving gameplay while chasing down any remaining bugs. I want to give a special shoutout to a few amazing players. The first is lewdev who was an early supporter of Space Huggers and is also one of the best players, holding the world record speedrun for a long while. I’d also like to congratulate KyRzYg on Newgrounds for having the current fastest speed run at a lightning fast 7 minutes 29 seconds! Also a big thank you to WOWdotStudios for sending me the first piece of fan art I’ve ever received, this super cool high resolution art of the player from Space Huggers. You might also recognize it as my profile image on Newgrounds! Space Huggers fan art by WOWdotStudios Wrap Up That’s the story of Space Huggers… for now. Thank you for reading! I hope you learned something from my crazy programming adventures. Follow me on twitter for all the latest updates on my experiments! The next JS13K competition is just about to begin and if you’re interested you can use the same engine I used to make Space Huggers as a starting point! That game engine is now called LittleJS and there is special example project for JS13K that builds to a 7KB zip leaving tons of room to pack with your art and gameplay. I can’t wait to see what you make with it! I’ll leave you with this video from a 4 player co-op game of Space Huggers I played with a few friends and it was a blast. Let me know if you give it a shot at your next game night! Just played Space Huggers 4 player co-op for the first time and it was awesome! There is room for improvement but proud to say the #js13k build is a solid and fun 4 player experience. Was planning on 1 game but they didn't want to stop. ✌😁 #screenshotsaturday #gamedev #indiedev pic.twitter.com/jkF42O7wlS — Frank Force 🌻 (@KilledByAPixel) September 19, 2021 Share this: Twitter Facebook Reddit LinkedIn Like this: Like Loading...

But I worry this is actually a code golf competition. I wonder how many entries are just auto-minified. reply lifthrasiir 4 hours agorootparentIn some way, it is; better minification does give you some additional margin. But it would then be a terrible code golf competition because 13 KiB here is the size after zip archiving so the actual limit is anywhere from 30--40 KiB for typical entries and would be very generous. The introduction of better compression tools may have lifted the upper limit a bit but not too much. (Disclaimer: I'm the author of one of such tools that got popular later.) It should be noted that most assets are still too large in this limit, so almost everything should be made from a code and many stuffs have to be consciously chosen to be included. For this reason, I feel that the limit is rather a very interesting threshold that allows for ordinary developers without much size optimization experience to start with, but should be plenty enough for experienced people to make difference. reply jsheard 3 hours agorootparentKind of tangental since it doesn't apply here but I love the compression hack used in JS competitions where HTTP wire compression or zipping the files don't count towards the size limit, so the HTML has to decompress itself. The canonical way to do it is to craft a file which browsers will parse as either a PNG or HTML, with the HTML part carrying a stub of Javascript which reads the page as a PNG, draws it into a canvas, extracts the pixel data, reinterprets it as a string containing the main JS payload and evals() it. reply lifthrasiir 3 hours agorootparentAFAIK js13kGames is intentionally using ZIP as a compressed container in order to avoid requiring such relatively obscure hacks to be competitive (up to some degree). Also the hack itself is now being less relevant due to the introduction of DecompressionStream and non-DEFLATE compression algorithms. reply Waterluvian 3 hours agorootparentprevAwesome, thanks. So while I might need to think about clever ways to generate/handle assets, I can generally not worry about \"all the clever JavaScript hacks\" and just write thoughtful TypeScript that I elide and minify. reply lifthrasiir 3 hours agorootparentYeah, most microscopic JS hacks would be too cumbersome to use in this scale. But some conscious decisions to structure your code may make a big difference. reply Cthulhu_ 4 hours agorootparentprevEven if minified, the file size is so constrained that it basically excludes the use of assets like images and audio files. reply whizzter 3 hours agorootparent13kb of 44khz 16bit MONO audio is 150ms, even with compression sampled audio is more or less out of the question.
