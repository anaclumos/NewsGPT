Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters The Observer Social media Telegram app founder Pavel Durov reportedly arrested at French airport Billionaire CEO, who was travelling aboard his private jet, was subject of arrest warrant, according to TV reports Nadeem Badshah and Reuters Sat 24 Aug 2024 18.25 EDT Share Pavel Durov, billionaire co-founder and chief executive of the Telegram messaging app, was arrested at the Bourget airport outside Paris on Saturday evening, TF1 TV said, citing an unnamed source. Durov was travelling aboard his private jet, TF1 said on its website, adding he had been targeted by an arrest warrant in France. The 39-year-old is understood to have been travelling from Azerbaijan and was arrested at about 8pm local time (6pm GMT). Durov was expected to appear in court on Sunday. The Russia-born entrepreneur lives in Dubai, where Telegram is based, and holds dual citizenship of France and the United Arab Emirates. Durov, who is estimated by Forbes to have a fortune of $15.5bn (£12bn), left Russia in 2014 after he refused to comply with demands to shut down opposition communities on his VK social media platform, which he sold. Telegram did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Russia’s embassy in France is taking “immediate steps” to clarify the situation. Citing a representative from the Russian embassy in France, TASS reported there had been no appeal from Durov’s team to the embassy, but that it was proactively taking “immediate” steps. Durov and his brother Nikolai founded the messaging app in 2013 and it has about 900 million active users. Telegram offers end-to-end encrypted messaging and users can also set up “channels” to disseminate information quickly to followers.

He'd have you believe that all messages are welcome on Telegram, that no material is censored, that it's all about free expression, that they're too small to provide moderation. But when an account is flagged for spam, Telegram rapidly responds and restricts or kills the account. So they can and do moderate content. It's just that accounts can get flagged for CSAM hundreds of times and Telegram takes no action. They're making a choice to provide a platform for this material. That's against the law and prison time is absolutely justified. reply walterbell 15 hours agorootparentIn cases where there is public evidence of illegal activity, where incidents have been reported to law enforcement, does Telegram provide LE with account information (e.g. phone number) for further investigation? Similar to Apple transparency reports? https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/ https://restoreprivacy.com/telegram-sharing-user-data/ > the operators of the messenger app Telegram have released user data to the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) in several cases. According to SPIEGEL information, this was data from suspects in the areas of child abuse and terrorism. In the case of violations of other criminal offenses, it is still difficult for German investigators to obtain information from Telegram, according to security circles. Signal and Telegram were publicly sparring in May 2024, https://threema.ch/en/blog/posts/chat-apps-government-ties-a... > two popular chat services have accused each other of having undisclosed government ties. According to Signal president Meredith Whittaker, Telegram is not only “notoriously insecure” but also “routinely cooperates with governments behind the scenes.” Telegram founder Pavel Durov, on the other hand, claims that “the US government spent $3 million to build Signal’s encryption” and Signal’s current leaders are “activists used by the US state department for regime change abroad.” reply codedokode 10 hours agorootparent> In the case of violations of other criminal offenses, \"other offences\" probably means copyright issues? reply bryanrasmussen 10 hours agorootparentprev>“notoriously insecure” sounds logical and can probably be checked! >\"routinely cooperates with governments behind the scenes.” sounds logical and being a big company I suppose true. >“the US government spent $3 million to build Signal’s encryption” sounds probable, meaning they got funding from some NSA project. >“activists used by the US state department for regime change abroad.” this sounds a bit crazy! reply bryanrasmussen 2 hours agorootparentevidently I'm getting downvoted because people have some opinions about these statements but they're also not able to enunciate what those opinions are even though they must be at odds with my opinions.

If the Swedish government really cared about children, they would do something to stop the massive underage gang violence problem the country has. 12 year olds being used as hitmen for drug gangs is not normal, yet that's the reality. reply estomagordo 10 hours agorootparentYou talk as if this is a problem that is easily solved. Of course government wish this could he solved.

If you want to see how much of the newspapers are censored in Sweden you’re free to go live there for a while, and witness the crime that happens and lack of support from police or media attention when the crime is committed by anyone who isn’t white and Swedish. zx10rse 11 hours agorootparentprevIgnorance is bliss. It literally takes 4 sec to perform a search and find plenty of such cases - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PXZxaKMl9Y (Sky News Investigates: Sweden's deadly gang war) \"How has a peaceful European country ended up the gun murder capital of the EU?\" \"Things got so bad that the government called in the army to help the police. And there's a new deadly trend emerging in this battle. Gang members as young as 14 are increasingly using explosives to target rivals as they fight over drug turfs. \" reply defrost 9 hours agorootparent\"Sky News Investigates\" is synonomous with Murdoch Press grossly exaggerates small issues to be world threatening edge of the seat click baiting prequels to the coming apocolypse. At least in Australia and in the UK. Maybe they're a moderate and balanced presenter of truth on the ground in Sweden. Seems unlikely. I'm fully aware this reads as \"attacking the source\" but there's no rabid attack intended here just a frank pragmatic assessment of what \"Sky News Investigates\" actually means. reply bryanrasmussen 10 hours agorootparentprevhttps://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/SWE/swe... things tend to be relative, hence statistics are a thing. The gun murder capital of Europe without some hard data as to what that means sounds a bit like the radiation poisoning center of Antarctica, gang members as young as 14 can definitely be increasingly doing things if before they started increasing there were zero gang members below 14 using explosives etc. Another problem is just taking what the police say as being \"true\", for example the police say there are 62000 people in Stockholm (a city of slightly over 920000) \"linked\" to criminal gangs - https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sweden-has-around-62000... this article uses the word linked twice, in the title linked to criminal gangs, and later in the article \"the authorities have struggled for years to contain violence linked to organised crime.\" I wonder if they have 62000 people who are violent in their linkage, somehow I doubt it but this seems to be the impression. Hey, I bet there is a problem, how big of a problem, probably not as big as these news stories imply. Why not? Well because if I had a really big nasty problem I wouldn't just imply it, I would lay it out, plenty of engagement to go around, but if my engagement could benefit from exaggerating the problem then I will imply instead of stating plainly. At any rate more than 6% of the population of Stockholm is currently not involved in a violent gang war which one might infer from the reportage. reply bryanrasmussen 3 hours agorootparentactually in that article from Reuters it says there were 62 deadly shootings in Sweden in the year. Which is hilarious because it also says there are 62000 gang linked people in Stockholm. One thing you are always told to watch out for is big round numbers in stats, because it is pretty unlikely it is just 62000 and not 62119 or something (not a big stats guy, just something I've read) At any rate the article says 62000 linked to gangs, and 62 killings (pretty weird that). So a 0.1% violence among the linked to gangs people (if all the murders were linked to gangs), but out of the full pop of Sweden 10,490,000 this is a 0.000591% rate of murder, the U.S as a whole has 0.0075 murder rate right now. Zoom in on parts of the U.S you get a much higher murder rate - https://usafacts.org/articles/which-cities-have-the-highest-... like I said everything is relative, and Sweden does not have as big a problem as the reporting lets on. reply zx10rse 8 hours agorootparentprevI love responses like this. Well there is only one way to find out statistically since you love statistics. If you are not an inmate I will assume that you are a free person living in a western society. Since you are free person you a free to go and live in Stockholm, lets just say for the statistics you are going to live in a slightly not so friendly neighbourhood where the lying police said that it is an area populated with predominantly 14 years old gang members, now since police by your own words cannot be trusted we will assume that their information is not correct and the area is perfectly fine and safe. Please run the maths and tell me with just 5% probability to get executed by a 14 years old gang member by walking down the street you live in to get to your home lets just say 100 times how likely is this event to occur? Of course the question that follow is are you going to take that chance ? I already know the answer. Now you can choose to deny reality and look away, but the good thing about reality is, that it is just like gravity it just hits you sometimes. I don't know if your PM have to call in the army to help with gang related crimes the situation seem pretty bad to me, again you are free to prove me wrong statistically, and take your chances. reply underbiding 6 hours agorootparentThese kind of responses (yours, zx10rse) are the absolute worst appeals to anecdote and bias I can think of. Someone actually comes along with a logical argument so you just give up and say \"yeah well uhhh I'd like to see you try\". Sad. reply bryanrasmussen 6 hours agorootparentprev>I love responses like this. I know we're supposed to think everybody is being honest here, but I don't think you do love responses like this. >Well there is only one way to find out statistically since you love statistics. right, to get the rates of deaths by violence, rates of death by gang related violence, compare that to other parts of the world with gang related violence etc. etc. I mean I agree, everybody knows how to do statistics! >Since you are free person you a free to go and live in Stockholm, I stand corrected, not everybody knows how to do statistics. >again you are free to prove me wrong statistically, and take your chances. but anyway that is not how statistics works. >Of course the question that follow is are you going to take that chance ? I already know the answer. You know the answer as to whether I am willing to move to a part of Stockholm the police identify as high crime from \"a western society\" based on a hacker news argument with someone who evidently doesn't know how statistics work? Amazing!! >Please run the maths and tell me with just 5% probability to get executed by a 14 years old gang member by walking down the street you live in to get to your home lets just say 100 times how likely is this event to occur? If \"with just 5% probability to get executed\" then the answer to \"how likely is this event to occur?\" is 5%. However as this is \"by walking down the street you live in to get to your home lets just say 100 times\" then that would mean 5 out of every 100 times somebody walks home they get executed. Given the earlier number of people in the article linked with crime was 62000, and assuming that everybody walks home at least once per day and 5% of people walking home get executed by 14 year olds it follows that in your world 3100 people per day are getting executed by 14 year olds in Stockholm, that seems a lot. I mean in 30 days that would be more than the number of people linked with crime! If that were true I don't think the EU would just be proposing to help inmates in their prisons but might be sending peace keeping forces in to help. reply bryanrasmussen 5 hours agorootparentobviously there are a number of points where I've fudged the numbers here, as I don't care much, for example with 3100 being killed the 5% of 62000 would be decreasing as it would no longer be 62000 - but I will leave that to other people to figure out. reply bryanrasmussen 3 hours agorootparentalso since only 62 people were violently shot in Sweden during the year I guess that also indicates this 5% thing just doesn't add up, unless these people are getting violently exploded I guess. reply codedokode 10 hours agorootparentprevI am curious, is the rise of violent crime somehow linked with migration from Asia and Africa or it is a completely unrelated issue and most of the criminals come from families who have lived in Sweden for many generations? reply johnyzee 5 hours agorootparentIt's largely second generation immigrants (yes, mostly from Africa and the Middle East, since that's where most immigration - in the shape of refugees - comes from). And take it from someone who actually lives in the area (as opposed to HN speculators): YES it has gotten significantly worse over the last five years (having already been bad for decades), and YES 14 year old hitmen with explosives and automatic weapons are now an actual thing, not just a couple of incidents. The politics of this is so inflamed, which makes it harder to discuss, much less solve the problems. I am not against immigration per se, from any given country. But right now, it is obviously causing major problems that need to be handled with extreme prejudice. reply jaakl 10 hours agorootparentprevSweden is building now new prison for underage and lacks thousands of seats for inmates.

When your threat model is \"someone owns my device\", it still doesn't matter if you control the hardware, because, in that scenario, Apple is the bad actor you're trying to protect against. There's no scenario where a third party has compromised your phone without Apple's collaboration, which is the only scenario where the secure enclave would maybe protect you (and even then, the bad actor would just read your messages off the screen or memory directly). reply lmm 18 hours agorootparentprevIn principle you can do the same thing of having keys in a secure enclave that can only be accessed if the bootloader and OS were signed with an appropriate key and not revoked. In practice there would certainly be a larger attack surface because you've now got n different hardware secure enclaves, n different bootloaders, and n different OS implementations, and a flaw in any one of them is potentially all that an attacker needs. Would you allow apple to apply a high standard and e.g. blacklist manufacturers who repeatedly had holes in their implementation? Would you trust Huawei's implementation to not have a hidden backdoor accessible only to the Chinese state and not discoverable otherwise? (Do you trust Apple's implementation to not have the same for the US/Israel?) reply cherryteastain 18 hours agorootparentprevSafety wise, Signal (or PGP email) on GrapheneOS is probably as good as it gets since it's all audited free open source code. reply funny_falcon 9 hours agorootparentAFAIK, Signal doesn’t provide any way to prove its application were built from non-modified audited free open source code.

The fact that Telegram doesn't reach this extremely low, very low bar is quite something. reply ranndino 16 hours agorootparentTelegram is not a behemoth like Facebook so doesn't have their resources to moderate everything.

Especially in the situation, when people who take on, like all officials, have no responsibility reply toofy 8 hours agorootparentit’s still a bit muddy why he was arrested, but it seems like it’s due to his constant dismissal of any responsibility. i’m not sure of the specifics of what you mean by 100% of officials must be thrown out” but if im understanding what you’re implying, i disagree, most land owners, elected officials, capable owners of organizations take meaningful or genuine good faith efforts to address open corruption in their spaces . and if they don’t, then yes, why wouldn’t we hold them responsible? it seems like you’re indicating there should be no consequences for people who don’t take on obligations… > i don’t see why there should be legal consequences for people who did not take on any obligations. of course they take on obligations, it’s partially why we pay executives so much because they’re taking on obligations. this isn’t some pauper struggling to pay rent on his studio apartment—he was arrested after traveling from one country to another in his private jet. again, i haven’t spent much energy on the implications from effect iteration of this but we have pretty solid evidence of what happens when we allow these wannabe kings to claim they should have nothing but positive personal benefits while externalizing any negatives onto the rest of us. “you should pay me obscene amounts and treat me like a king while i take no responsibility whatsoever” is absurd. and we’re seeing the cascading effects of this absurdity in real time. reply Ray20 7 hours agorootparent>most land owners, elected officials, capable owners of organizations take meaningful or genuine good faith efforts to address open corruption in their spaces And I am saying that zero percent of them do that. And somebody saying that Durov \"take meaningful or genuine good faith efforts to address open corruption in their spaces\". My point is that there is no way to verify the degree of \"good faith genuinity\", so we cant use that parameter in aspect of legal actions. reply toofy 6 hours agorootparent> there is no way to verify the degree of \"good faith genuinity\", so we cant use that parameter in aspect of legal actions. of course there is… one of the reasons people justifiably bring up spam in these “my free speech” cases is because it shows definitively that the “free speech absolutists” don’t actually care about free speech—if they truly believed all speech is as valuable as all other speech then spam would have the same weight of priority as non-spam speech for them, yet they have no problem silencing spam. off the top of my head, we would consider their guard rails against spam and have they implemented those same guard rails against the things they’re being charged for? if not, then obviously they’re not making real attempts. of course there are multiple ways to determine whether they’ve made meaningful attempts. i think this is all moot though, if my understanding is correct, he’s resisted doing anything at all which is why he’s been charged. as i said in a different post though, it’s still muddy on the specifics, we’ll know more later—we’re just wildly guessing at this point. reply parineum 1 hour agorootparent> if they truly believed all speech is as valuable as all other speech That's a strawman.

If I make a platform that shuffles bits around, and a bunch of users start using it for CP and terrorism (lets assume perfect enforcement/investigative capability up until piercing the platform, so probability 1 on the CP/terrorism front); I don't think the choice then is \"lets shluff this to someone responsible to admin/make a tap\". The only ethically tenable approach would be \"well, no more moving bits around by anyone for anyone else anymore\". And at that point we've unmade computing essentially. No one, and I mean \"Not One Single Entity, government or otherwise\" can be trusted to not to abuse privileged access; and once put into the position to abuse, abstain from doing so. Abuse is probability 1. This is part of why I believe Stallman was right. The concept of the user account has been a disaster for the human species. As it is by the prescribing of unique identifiers to discern one operation on behalf of someone from another that has created a world in which we can even imagine such horrifying concepts as a small group unilaterally managing the entirety of the rest of humanity, for any purpose.

Sometimes though, you have to accept that there are extremely unpleasant consequences out there that cannot be satisfactorally mitigated. So I have a return question for you. Are you sure that the question you asked is the one you should be asking, or should you be asking yourself, \"how many lives are acceptable casualties in order to continue operating within the bounds of my assumed ethical envelope?\" Because there is a counter of people effected; you may not be able to read it or write it, but it's there. reply codedokode 20 hours agorootparentprevTelegram allows to report illegal posts; I suggest that France arrests those who saw the posts but didn't report them instead. reply NoxiousPluK 20 hours agorootparentTo be fair, anyone that has used Telegram for a while know that this is just a mock option to fool regulators.

There's constant scandals and if a child that gets into a social services institution makes it into university, just one, any given year, that's national news. Prostitution in social services is common, drugs and crime are everywhere. It seems there is A LOT more work to be done on the other side of social services first.

First, your analogy is broken -- roads, telephones, pen and paper, motor vehicles all fit your description just as aptly. Second, you propose your preferred moral economy as one that only curtails harms. In fact, you create another harm implementing what you think is right. Reasonable people disagree about which is worse -- the creation and public support of a technocratic oligarchy in control of how humans communicate or the proliferation of some harms that take advantage of unfettered communication. But please don't be simple minded, pretending to yourself or others that there aren't real costs, social and physical, on both sides of this.

Pornography depicting rape. [1] Includes accelerationism. France just had a terrorist attack on a synagogue. Germany had one on a city festival. Could be related to either. We don't know! And yet, with all above being said, as much of a cesspool Telegram is, I much rather have such centralized there than in an application with group E2E encryption.

Routine police inspection on a road and in particular control of borders and key nodes in your transportation infrastructure isn't exactly controversial. (unless you're part of some extreme political faction). You know a lot of countries where people can drive without a license plate? Private communication is important but it has always had limits, this crypto mentality of companies exercising no compliance, having no borders, ignoring the law and national security doesn't have a precedent. Historically people communicated say in the US using an American telecommunications network which without a doubt complied with legal requests. It's not at all self evident that we should tolerate telecoms infrastructure operated by a Russian out of Dubai that is primarily used by an enemy we're effectively at war with. reply jack_pp 14 hours agorootparentThat's because they are different, police can come with a warrant to check your house for illegal activity but they can't monitor you remotely 24/7 with barely any human intervention and store everything you do indefinitely. With electronic communication you either get full privacy or none. And no, putting company's in charge of your privacy isn't a solution, if they can be compelled to give away your communication history then they'll abuse it. Have you not learned anything from the Snowden leaks? reply yorwba 13 hours agorootparentPolice got a warrant for Durov and arrested him. How is that different? Yet some people are upset anyways. And it's not true that with electronic communication you either get full privacy or none. You can have end-to-end encrypted messages with unencrypted metadata, so that when police observe a message implicating the sender in a crime (e.g. on an arrested suspect's phone) they can get a search warrant for the IP address or phone number associated with that account and then visit the owner in person to look at the messages on their phone. This doesn't allow police to read everyone's messages all the time undetected, but does allow them to read specific people's messages if they get a warrant. Since Telegram doesn't only have unencrypted metadata but also plenty of unencrypted messages, there must've been many cases where a search warrant would've yielded lots of useful information. If Telegram didn't properly respond to all warrants, it seems fair to launch an investigation. reply jiiam 11 hours agorootparentAccording to the Telegram FAQ (https://www.telegram.org/faq#q-do-you-process-data-requests) data on their servers is encrypted and the keys are split and stored in different jurisdictions (and different from the jurisdiction where the data is stored). With such a setup what does it mean to comply with warrants? Are we saying that Telegram should voluntarily yield all information regardless of jurisdiction? reply yorwba 10 hours agorootparentAh, this multi-jurisdiction setup explains why Durov himself was targeted. As the presumed controlling entity behind that network of shell companies, serving him with a warrant seems like the most effective legal means to make Telegram comply. reply wussboy 17 hours agorootparentprevI think private communications are a human right as well.

GP laid out his principle above: \"If your app is known to be uses heavily by criminals ranging from Pedo's to drug dealers.

Because we want to, and we can. I don't get how HN consistently fails to understand the actual social and political process by which regulations are made. I constantly see this argument which effectively boils down to \"if you ban a thing, you will also need to ban everything else, which is absurd, so you shouldn't ban anything\". But in real life we can choose what we ban. Everything is a trade-off; we can choose to ban something if the harm it creates is considered to outweigh its benefit to society. It is open to society to decide that Telegram is more proximate to the harm being caused, and less otherwise socially useful, than an ISP, and on that basis punish the former but not the latter. (It is also reasonable to argue that Telegram is not sufficiently proximate to the harm and that it is sufficiently socially useful that it should be allowed to operate, and honestly I sympathise with that argument more. But my point is that it is a matter of weighing social harm vs benefit and not just a technical analysis of \"where the bits go\".)

There is pretty much 0% chance you'll buy drugs or fake documents using the geo search. They will scam you for a transfer and disappear. It really is no that different from a spam email, just different media and targeting. That said, you CAN buy drugs on Telegram, sure, it is just not as easy as everyone seems to think. You need to know the account name of a service that delivers in your area, you need to be reeealy careful when typing the account name because for every real drug seller account there are multiple fakes with slight variation in the name that fish for people using search, and then even if you have a verified account and they sold you drugs last month, there is like 30% chance that the account have been compromised and now you are talking with scammers again. reply LtWorf 2 hours agorootparentI went ahead with a prostitute who wrote to me on tg.

I think nerds may not fully grasp Telegram's security model: it's essentially stateless, not tied to any particular country. Its infrastructure is distributed across various jurisdictions, with no official representation in many countries—no subsidiaries, nothing. As a result, it doesn't respond to authorities because it doesn't have to. However, this approach is unsustainable and unacceptable for many governments, both in the East and the West.

Apple is not a nation or a court that can make decisions like that on their behalf; they have been sued several times for taking punitive action that is illegal obstruction.

It works with 90% of the bikes/motor brands on the market, so I assumed that some people here might be interested, if they got a non-functional batteries but they still want to use their e-bike? We believe that everybody should have control about stuff they own, and we should fight against planned obsolescence! Here are a few videos about our founder on the battery itself, why we built it, and how to assemble it: - What is the Gouach Battery: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsuW1NPkvNk - Presentation of the pack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLoCihE0eIA - Presentation of the fireproof and waterproof casing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDJpt7RDbRM Here are the juicy bits: https://docs.gouach.com We'd love some feedback from the e-bike DIY builder community Oh, and it's launching as a Kickstarter in September and there is an offer for early-backers here https://get.gouach.com/1 for a 25% discount on the battery! You can follow us on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/gouach.batteries to get the latest news! reply briansm 12 hours agoparentI thought the reason the packs are sealed is to stop amateurs from swapping in cells of differing voltages, which short each other out and cause sparking/fire hazards. There's a reason li-ion battery charging is current-limited, they have no internal resistance. reply s0rce 1 hour agorootparentAlso spot welded connections work well, transfer reasonable amounts of current and don't tend to vibrate off during use. We tear down packs at my job and there are warnings inside some not to re-use cells for vapes, they really don't want you taking these apart. Larger packs like EVs and E-bikes are probably worth refurbishing and repairing. reply bittumenEntity 6 hours agorootparentprevAs I understand it, it's somewhat the opposite for internal resistance. You need to have current limiting in place because the internal resistance of the cell is turning that current into heat, and heat is the enemy of batteries. (Probably there's also a complicated chemical reason for current limiting that I don't fully grasp) reply slim 11 hours agorootparentprevfrom their homepage : A Fireproof Casing which REALLY Works!

Seriously. reply crhulls 4 hours agorootparentI'm the CEO of Tile and we are working on a line of products for theft. As a genuine question, I'm very surprised that many people don't seem concerned that AirTags alert thieves to their presence. If your bike is stolen the thief will get the notification, even if they are on Android (with the new shared platform rogue tag detection). I'm trying to understand the user psychology here - not pitch our own products. Do you have any specific features you would like to prevent theft? reply yardie 4 hours agorootparentThe fact that something is being tracked and the thieves know it’s being tracked is a deterrent itself. Like the value of stolen iPhones crashed because activation lock made them worthless. So they moved on to Samsung Galaxies, until they implemented their own activation lock. If you steal a bike with a tracker on it you’ll probably leave it right there for the real owner to find. reply crhulls 4 hours agorootparentOf course I know this, but I am trying to go deeper. With AirTags and the new standards you literally can find and disable the tag for anyone using the Google or Apple networks. I am surprised that people think the benefits of AirTags outweigh the downsides given the alternatives, of which we are one. I'm mainly just trying to learn. I also think you probably are overestimating the deterrent value. Thieves are not necessarily thoughtful and the alerts aren't real time. Once they get the alert they might ditch the bike, but if it is back at their garage they will probably disable or remove it. I also am a bit triggered by this line \"Honestly, you as the CEO should know this.\" which is on the edge of being an ad hominem. Why did you choose to include this? And wouldn't you know that I know these things? Like I am asking questions to get nuanced user feedback. Do you think someone who runs a consumer product company (I started Life360, Tile's owner), isn't deeply aware of how customers think? reply yardie 3 hours agorootparentFirst, I want to apologize. The last statement came out a lot more combatant than I realized. So I removed it. I was a Tile wallet user until I stopped carrying a wallet completely. There are 2 types of thieves: the professional and the opportunistic. Opportunistic, the majority, aren't doing more than they have to and if the bike has a tracker they know about it makes it less appealing. And if you can get the casual thief to give up immediately then the device has already payed for itself. The professional will chop it immediately. I see kids in my neighborhood with $2000+ Trek Marlins, with all the expensive mountain bike parts removed. They simply wanted a bike to freestyle on. And doing all that probably took hours if not days. The professional is not going to spend anymore time than they have to disable a tracker when there are better options all around. reply samstave 4 hours agorootparentprevHowdy! Great to meet you. I have a ton of thoughts on this matter, but not well threaded for quick reply: so forgive the stream-of-thought nature of the following. There is no real secret answer to stopping bike thieves, because the primary problem is both cultural and infrastructure. We dont have bike culture that allows for safe bike leaving-about, and we dont have bike infrastructure for safe bike locking-about. (Bike Hack SF: Take your nice bike into a nice hotel and tip the DoorMan $5 to check your bike into luggage check rather than lock it up) So, my airtag is in a case with security bolts under the bottle cage - and its more a check that I can know where it was last seen. Though I didnt remove the chirper. What if you could have a TILE that is the fob for this battery. Where the battery wont go unless the paired Tile Fob is present? A Lora Tile would be killer If you had a Lora network on this battery, with a TILE app infra on top of it and all the batteries talked to eachother - you built an anti-theft-mesh so all the bikes tiles all tell eachother about themselves. Tile integration with Shimano Motors and e-tube iso app to stop the motor from running unless Tile fob/phone app present. A magnetic Solonoid crank-shaft-blocker. And above all else pushing for better bike policies in municipalities. reply crhulls 4 hours agorootparentWe are doing a satellite integration with Hubble Network - 24/7 global coverage, no increase in battery life.

That being said, I am a bit skeptical about your claims to be fireproof. Did you try to start a battery fire inside your enclosure? Aluminum melts at about 600C, while lithium burns much hotter than that. reply joegibbs 17 hours agoprevI've been working on a kind of strategy game called Fall of an Empire (https://fallofanempiregame.com), it's a bit like a mix between Crusader Kings, Total War, Mount and Blade type games (just the overworld, not the battles), but rather than expanding you're trying to prevent an empire from collapsing. It's a ton of work, especially with the number of systems - you've got combat, resource management, settlement development, food managment, espionage, diplomacy etc - these all need to play together well. And then you've got to add in the storyline, graphics, marketing -but I think I'm making pretty good progress. I'm still using Unreal Engine 4 because I started work on that version and I haven't needed to upgrade to 5 since it's been released. I've got a free prologue that I'm releasing on October 1, so now until then is a lot of polishing to make it work well. reply YesBox 16 hours agoparentSteam recently made some changes that are pushing game studios away from prologues. Instead, demos can have their own steam pages. Plus all hyperlinks will soon be banned. I also noticed your game has been up on Steam since January 2022 and by the looks of it, you've done about zero marketing (steamdb.info). Hope that's on the horizon, it's a pretty darn important part of game development now! Love the concept of your game. Reminds me of my favorite roman emperor: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian - Fellow game developer reply joegibbs 13 hours agorootparentThank you! If you replace a prologue (as standalone game) with a demo, can you transfer the wishlists? Marketing isn’t my strong point, if I ever had the money to make another the first person I’d hire would be marketing. My boss owns a PR agency and she said she can help in getting it out to journalists but that’s about it. I tried CPC and it came in at about $1/wishlist. Are there any methods of marketing you recommend? reply YesBox 5 hours agorootparentAsk steam if you can swap out the store pages. I've never seen it done before though. $1/WL is good (not great or bad), depending on how much your game is going to cost and the projected WL->Sale conversion. I recommend you read through most of the articles and blog posts here: www.howtomarketagame.com It's a good starting place. reply spacebacon 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is a good start … A press release may be a good next step.

They gave everyone half their money back, this free upgrade, new factions, bigger map and a ton of changes. Overall its been a big push from their side to keep the player base happy. But yeah, there's obviously a big market for historical games, from city builders, combat, etc. and I'm here for them all. reply f6v 4 hours agorootparentA safe generalization about Dynasties is that “no one cares”. It has about 2.5k players now, same as Attila (one of the most controversial titles released 10 years ago). People keep bringing up Dynasties, but it’s obvious CA doesn’t know how to make successful historical titles anymore.

It's fun to play with, but it's a very limiting tool: you can do a lot to compose signed distance functions, but there's no way to control the rendering or do anything \"custom\" that the tool doesn't explicitly allow. So lately I've been working on a \"v2\" that exposes a full superset of GLSL, so you can write arbitrary shaders -- even foregoing SDFs altogether -- in a high-level lisp language. The core \"default\" raymarcher is still there, but you can choose to ignore it and implement, say, volumetric rendering, while still using the provided SDF combinators if you want. The new implementation is much more general and flexible, and it now supports things like 2D extrusions, mesh export for 3D printing, user-defined procedural noise functions... anything you can do in Shadertoy, you can now do in Bauble. One upcoming feature that I'm very excited about is custom uniforms and embedding in other webpages -- so you can write a blog post with interactive 3D visualizations, for example. (Also as a fun coincidence: my first cast bronze Bauble arrived today! https://x.com/ianthehenry/status/1827461714524434883) reply turtledragonfly 13 hours agoparentAm I right that the output of the lisp code is ultimately a plain GLSL shader (like one might find on shadertoy.com)? I built a SDF-based rendering system (2D) for my game, and one of the big hurdles was how to have them be data-driven, rather than needing a new shader for each scene or object. Would be curious if/how you tackled that problem (: reply jkcxn 2 hours agorootparentI've done this for a project where the SDF functions are basically instructions, and you can build up instrictions on the CPU to send to the shader. and then the fragment shader runs them like a mini bytecode interpreter. You can tile up the screen to avoid having too many instructions per fragment. Kinda wild idea and performance may vary depend on what you're doing reply ianthehenry 13 hours agorootparentprevYep! It just outputs GLSL. It doesn't do anything smart -- it's a single giant shader that gets recompiled whenever you change anything, so it wouldn't really work for something like a game. I mean, it could handle like basic instancing of the form \"union these N models, where Nproduct is money so you'd only stand to make a profit never a loss you're grabbing the expense part of the business that everybody else is trying to shed. Let's talk also about time value of money. All the money that you've invested in cash is not making money passively as other investments do. Compared to putting the money in the stock market, you're losing 7% a year on this scheme, plus the expenses of running your business, and opportunity cost of not doing something else that generates income. reply efishnc 17 hours agoparentprevVery cool and super clean website! Talk about your infra please! reply nlh 13 hours agorootparentThanks!! Infra: I was hosted on Google Cloud for a while -- literally a single VM running Docker Compose, but I decided I wanted something a bit more flexible and interesting, so last month I switched everything over to Fly.io and I am incredibly happy with them. It's just so easy and fun to manage. The retail site (rarity7.com) is just a small VM running a Crystal server process to handle web requests. Image hosting is all done on Cloudinary. My backend / inventory management / trading + research engine is a separate Crystal process in a separate VM. Both connect to a Fly Postgres DB. There's one other service which is a small python process on another VM which is doing inference on my regression model. That's super lightweight and I don't need any GPUs to do the inference (tabular data is nice like that). Overall it's really nothing fancy and it works quite well. A few web-serving VMs and an inference service for my pricing model. I train/retrain the model a few times a year on a local box (my repurposed gaming rig running a 2080Ti). reply theogravity 18 hours agoparentprevThat's neat and congrats! How long does it take to be part of the authorized dealers listed on the site? reply nlh 13 hours agorootparentI did it all in about 2-3 years. I was a big collector as a kid but didn't get back into it in a serious way until 2021. Becoming an authorized dealer is basically, fundamentally about building trust. The whole coin industry operates in a very old-school relationship-based trusted way. To become a member of most professional orgs or become an authorized dealer, you need to have 5-10 VERY solid references from other members or authorized dealers, and the only way to get those references is to be a part of the community, build trust, and build relationships by doing business with others (which means honoring your commitments and your word and writing good checks, etc.). In the end, you need to ask 5-10 people to personally vouch for you, so they'd better know you and actually trust you. reply profsummergig 8 hours agoparentprevAm curious how you handle trust. E.g. someone says the delivery didn't come through. Or that the coin is not authentic. Those are some expensive coins! So was curious. reply nlh 4 hours agorootparentGreat question. Authenticity is easy - I mostly deal with certified coins, which means they’ve all been authenticated and guaranteed by a 3rd party service which stands behind their mark (they will pay you for the coin if they make a mistake, which does happen). For shipping, that’s just pretty standard across most industries - I have shipping insurance and if USPS fails, they’ll pay for it. But losses happen and it’s just a matter of business (thankfully they’re rare). reply wyclif 15 hours agoparentprevCool project!

It would not be deeply hard to build, but it would mean training a model which means getting good enough training data which means taking the time to actually do it. It hasn't been done because it requires someone who is deeply knowledgable about coins AND someone who knows how to train a model and build an app, and the fact is that intersection is pretty small (it's me and probably 20 other people? Give or take). This is very much on my long-term roadmap. In the short term, the easiest way is to find someone who does this (eg me) and just email me some pictures. I'd be happy to tell you if you've got anything good. The old school neural net between my ears can assist. (See profile for email). reply Loughla 5 hours agorootparentThat's fair. I have to imagine that there's a market for a product like that. My mind goes to auctioneers and estate sales. I know the local auctioneer would kill for a tool like that. Something to keep in mind if you do build that: have a one time purchase or month long purchase option. When my wife's grandma died, we had to go through her coins looking for good ones.

This sort of thing is _very_ interesting to me, and I rather desperately want something like to this tied to listings of books. I would like to read more diversely --- at one time I was trying to read one book from each LoC division, starting at the top/broadest (so A--Z), then iterating down, but this got to be exhausting because it was difficult to determine which book to read. A later effort was to read biographies of famous people to my children in chronological order as they were growing up --- dry run was the very simple set of U.S. Presidents --- but again researching and ordering was a big problem. So, my hopes for this are that it includes footnotes/references/links to supporting material (perhaps affiliate links on Amazon would be one way to fund things?) and that it is possible to click through to find information on specific technical topics as well as general explanations. reply john_minsk 8 hours agoparentprevThis is super cool!

Felt like I was paying for a product and also the product. I just needed to keep 2 calendars in sync, not smart meetings, analytics, integrations, etc. ideally I set it up and forget about it. I really needed a way to sync my calendars privately, without all the extras. Now that Dropbox has purchased Reclaim, it's even more important I feel like my calendars are not spied on. I knew I could provide a similar service. Here’s what makes me excited about it as a user: Affordable: Just $20/year with a 7-day free trial. Cancel at any time for a pro-rated refund. Privacy First: No need to store events on a servers enabling unlimited calendar syncs. Working Hours: Adaptive feature that adjusts if an event falls outside your specified working hours. Round Event Times: Opt to round event start and end times to the nearest 15 or 30 minutes for cleaner scheduling. Invitations: Block time between calendars when you receive a meeting invitation that you haven't responded to yet. Decline it? The time block on your other calendar is removed.

This is due to a combination of the advent of semantic search and the revival of personal knowledge management in the deluge of our age. As such, I’ve been working on the software to bring this vision to life, which is called Your Commonbase (a portmanteau of Commonplace Book and Vector Database). In short, the purpose of the work is to create a data structure that works the way humans store, retrieve, and share information. By making these three elements as close to zero stress as possible, you catalyze creativity through remixing and augmentation of memories. My hypothesis is a lifetime building a Commonbase creates an idiosyncratic system, filled with the interpretations of an individual or a group. This individualized structure then creates demand that others want. I.e, a curation of all of the books you have read, organized by the marginalia you have added to them. This is a system people would pay for, and also a system that becomes more valuable over time.

And I took my new quadcopter drone out and did some flying last night for the first time. As in, my first time flying a drone, ever. The results were... predictable. Let's just say, I bought a cheap (\". Also the links are all for query pages on amazon/spotify/etc, which says LLM to me (rather than a database). This dynamic schema generation -> UI supported query builder seems like a really interesting direction. I'd love to see it for the web more generally and I bet Exa.ai+LLM of choice would be a pretty good place to start. If it's an LLM I'm curious about hallucination rates and excited for future web-level RAG in only returning real objects. Also you can supply content which doesn't exist and it will automatically infer genre and such (another strong indication of LLM). I.e. you can imagine the aesthetics of the kind of content you might want by title and then use the UI to explore real recs related to that.

I'm not sure about the FAANG open source projects that are used as libraries (Guava, React, ...). These projects fundamentally don't jeopardize these company's businesses, and serve to increase the developer goodwill amongst the engineers. Nobody can predict the future but I can't imagine these projects becoming relicensed. More plausible scenario is them becoming an abandonware, but even in those cases the community can carry the torch. reply 8organicbits 16 hours agorootparentAgreed, and there's a few projects with CLAs that are ranked lower due to mitigating factors, like K8s [1]. I honestly don't get why they have a CLA, anyone know? The impact of developer good will is difficult to measure, so I don't attempt it. Redis burned community good will so badly with their relicensing that several forks rapidly emerged. Seemed like a predictably poor decision to me.

In my view, Mozilla doesn't seem the same as it once was but maybe there are specific reasons the open-sourceness isn't in jeopardy. reply 8organicbits 16 hours agorootparentFirefox scores well because it uses a copyleft license and the ability to relicense contributions remains with the original authors. Mozilla can't unilaterally relicense the Firefox code base as they haven't been granted that ability by the contributors. The copyleft license means they can't slap a new license on top (like a permissive license allows). The rating criteria was designed to consider legal facators, like license terms and CLA, so concerns like Mozilla buying an ad company aren't factored in. Those concerns feel more subjective to me, but are certainly valid. https://alexsci.com/relicensing-monitor/projects/firefox/ reply PeeMcGee 17 hours agorootparentprevI imagine Firefox would die instantly if it moved to a restrictive license. It would be too easy to simply switch to a popular fork, and Firefox's userbase are the type that would be compelled to follow through with it. Even ignoring FOSS principles reasons, most folks are browser-savvy enough to understand the implications of such news -- their favorite browser is about to kill itself so they have to pick another one. Also consider that Firefox would no longer be the default browser in most Linux distros, and likely prohibited from official package repositories entirely. reply bambax 5 hours agoprevI'm trying up standup comedy this summer -- open mics for now.

It's challenging as: - Users want to use the app offline which means we need to sync - We have to match our existing features on [2] in the first version and evolve the API and database to support reliable sync - Users want to also track their cardio too e.g. Running Level [3] and Rowing Level [4] but that will have to come out in a future version [1] https://strengthlevel.com/ [2] https://my.strengthlevel.com/ [3] https://runninglevel.com/ [4] https://rowinglevel.com/ reply tristanMatthias 1 hour agoparentJust downloaded!

Native apps not released yet but you are welcome to try the web app at my.strengthlevel.com reply Rendello 2 hours agoprevI've been building a web extension for an Inuit language (ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ ᖃᓂᐅᔮᖅᐸᐃᑦ). Most Inuit in Canada speak Inuktitut, which is a language with long words and two different writing systems: the latin alphabet, and syllabics. Syllabics are specially adapted for Inuktitut and well-loved by the Inuit, but unfortunately can be a pain to input on a computer, so often times the more cumbersome latin alphabet is used in casual writing. Tom Scott has an awesome video about how syllabics work[1], but breifly, the shape of the character determined its inital consonant spund, and the rotation determines its vowel sound. So ᐱ = pi, ᐳ = pu, ᐸ = pa, ᑎ = ti, ᑐ = tu, ᑕ = ta, etc. The word \"Inuktitut\" becomes ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ in syllabics. Transliterating between the two is fairly simple, but there are edge-cases around dialects and whatnot. The more interesting problem from a technical perspective is having a web extension that can detect Inuktitut on a web page (in wither writing system), and transliterate that into whatever writing system the user desires, whilst never accidentally transliterating the other text on the page (\"inhabitants\" could be picked up and transliterated as \"ᐃᓐᕼᐊᖯᐃᑕᓐᑦᔅ\", for example, even though that makes no sense). The project is mostly using Rust via WebAssembly, which has been a lot of fun to work with and has let me do some awesome things, like avoiding heap allocation and using compile-time hashmaps to do conversions on the text. The build system has to do a lot and I eventually settled on python. Right now I'm trying to wrangle JS and the DOM (there's a lot of edge cases to deal with), and that's been difficult as it's not my wheelhouse. 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW4hI_METac&t=15s reply rudasn 5 hours agoprevI'm experimenting to figure out the simplest setup possible that allows me to expose an internal web service (eg localhost:3000) to the public Internet (eg app.example.com). A million ways to do this, of course, but I'm focused on using wireguard so that eg only my wireguard peers can get access to my local service, and for internal traffic (ie vpn). At the moment I'm settling on having a simple script that I can run on a host alongside wireguard. The script will function like `wg-quick`, parsing a wireguard config file and handilng the routing stuff behind the scenes, and returning a cleaned up config to be passed to `wg`. Ideally, the wireguard configs could be generated by some other tool or service, like https://wirehub.org, and automatically fetched and applied to the running wg interface. So, a one liner on a server with a public IP and the services exposed by your wireguard peers can be accessed via a custom domain name while still respecting internal wireguard routing rules (based on AllowedIPs). If anyone finds this interesting and wants to chat about it, I would love to! My contact info is in my profile. reply hyperbolablabla 5 hours agoparentThis is what ngrok does right? I'm really interested in how this works, I've never looked into it before. Presumably it requires some kind of dynamic DNS updates if you don't have a static IP? reply rudasn 5 hours agorootparentngrok, localtunnel, pyjamas, the list is endless.. Yeah, many ways to do it, one is running your own DNS server and have wireguard connections use that DNS server. I want to avoid having DNS issues, so I'm thinking more like this: 1. DNS CNAME *.internal.example.com 123.23.45.67 2. On 123.23.45.67, run wg. 3. On 123.23.45.67 , run nginx. nginx must be in the same network to do geo blocking on Wireguard peer addressess. 4. Create one nginx server config per service to map domain names to upstream servers. Use variables for upstream servers, allow nginx to start even if upstreams unreachable. Add internal locations for custom errors (Forbidden, Unreachable, etc). 5. When connecting to 123.23.45.67 via Wireguard (ie, Peer Endpoint = 123.23.45.67), ensure 123.23.45.67 is in the range defined by Peer AllowedIPs. reply she11c0de 7 hours agoprevhttps://defguard.net/ - open-source SSO service built with rust on top of wireguard & OIDC.

You can make a great tee, but fewer people will pay $100 versus $30, so finding a balance is necessary.

This system is designed to identify and extract key entities from blocks of text, such as names, locations, or organizations, and then provide rich contextual information about them. The goal is to transform raw text into meaningful data that users can easily understand and leverage in various applications. The real magic of DataSignal lies in how it delivers this contextual information. It can be seamlessly integrated into your workflow through a browser plugin, which instantly highlights and explains entities as you browse the web. For developers, DataSignal can be embedded directly into a webpage via JavaScript, enhancing the content on the page with dynamic insights. Additionally, it offers a REST API, allowing for flexible and customizable integration into other software systems. Whether you're a developer looking to enhance your application with smart text analysis or someone who wants to streamline research and data gathering, DataSignal is poised to bring a new level of insight and efficiency to text analysis.

Created a MVP, air-gapped for military use, but it can be used for anyone including businesses/consumers who need an on-prem AI computer. It has zero lag or zero second delay in responding your questions, and does not use any third party AI cloud platform. This is critical, because some of our customers have restrictive requirements for their data and they can't have anything of their customers to be placed on these cloud platforms. (eg. OpenAI, Google, Apple). Adding additional features including Self-Teach, Cloned Personality, the holographic UI Wear, makes calls on behalf of the user, uses voice imprinting, edit videos, autonomously, for content creators and remembers 100 years of your life. And, more. The UI Wear uses the exotic sensors I used in military to make it light and performant unlike Apple Vision Pro. Imagine interacting with something like \"Jarvis\" from Ironman. Quiet similiar but much more grounded in a sense that it's simpler and logical. Also, you can take it with you to play fast action sports or play games like Dragon-Ball-Z type game with your buddies. And it lasts a day, not two hours, on a full charge. You can interact with the Personal AI Computer without the UI Wear, but it takes you to another level of experience.

The arrest took place as Durov, accompanied by his bodyguard and a woman, stepped off a private jet that had arrived from Azerbaijan. The arrest was made on the basis of a French search warrant issued by the National Directorate of Judicial Police, following a preliminary investigation. Durov was placed on a federal wanted list and the warrant was issued because of his alleged failure to cooperate with the French authorities. Durov is accused of numerous serious crimes, including: Terrorism Drug trafficking Complicity in criminal activities Fraud Money laundering Concealment of illegal activities Distribution of child sexual abuse content French authorities believe that Telegram, under Durov’s leadership, became a major platform for organised crime due to its encrypted messaging services, which allegedly facilitated illegal activities. Investigators have taken Durov into custody and he is expected to be brought before a judge soon. The seriousness of the charges could lead to a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Impact on the crypto TON The arrest had an immediate impact on the cryptocurrency market. Toncoin, the cryptocurrency associated with Telegram, fell significantly, dropping more than 15% on the markets after the news of the arrest. The European Union’s accusations The main accusation by EU authorities concerns Telegram’s encrypted messaging services, which were allegedly used to facilitate organised crime. One investigator stated that ‘Telegram has become the number one platform for organised crime over the years’, underlining the perceived link between the platform’s privacy features and criminal activities. Durov is French: he will face trial in France As a French citizen, Durov will be tried in France and will have to answer to the charges against him.

As a service provider, you're not responsible for what your users post as long as you take appropriate action after being informed of illegal content.

A company that makes an effort to comply with laws is in a completely different category than a company that makes the fact that they’ll look the other way one of their core selling points. Years ago there was a case where someone built a business out of making hidden compartments in cars. He did an amazing job of making James Bond style hidden compartments that perfectly blended into the interior. He was later arrested because drug dealers used his hidden compartment business to help their drug trade. There was an uproar about the fact that he wasn’t doing the drug crimes himself. He was only making hidden compartments which could be used for anything. How was he supposed to know that the hidden compartments were being used for illegal activities rather than keeping people’s valuables safe during a break-in? Yet when the details of the case came out, IIRC, it was clear that he was leaning into the illegal trades and marketing his services to those people. He lost his plausible deniability after even a cursory look at how he was operating. I don’t know what, if any, parts of that case apply to Pavel Durov. I do like to share it as an example of how intent matters and how one can become complicit in other crimes by operating in a manner where one of your selling points is that you’ll help anyone out even when their intent is to break the law. It’s also why smart corporate criminals will shut down and walk away when it becomes too obvious that they’re losing plausible deniability in a criminal enterprise. reply kyleee 1 hour agorootparentIs it illegal to offer legal services to undesirables and/or criminals? reply Muromec 39 minutes agorootparentTry to deposit 10k to your bank account and then, when they call you and ask the obvious question, answer that you sold some meth or robbed someone.

For example, CP absolutely exists on platforms like FB or IG, but Meta will absolutely try to moderate it away to the best of their ability and cooperate with law enforcement when it is brought to their attention. And like I have mentioned a couple times before, Telegram was only allowed to exist because the UAE allowed them to, and both the UAE and Russia gained ownership stakes in Telegram by 2021. Also, messaging apps can only legally operate in the UAE if they provide decryption keys to the UAE govt because all instant messaging apps are treated as VoIP under their Telco regulation laws.

A lawyer abetting in criminal behaviour is committing a crime, but the crime is not offering his services to criminals, which is completely legal. When offering their services to criminals law firm or individual lawyers in most cases are not required to report crimes they have been made aware of under the attorney-client privilege and are not required to ask to minimize bad actors from using their services. In short: unless they are committing crimes themselves, criminal lawyers are not required to stay clear from criminals, actually, usually the opposite is true. Again, presumption of innocence do exists. reply alephnerd 1 hour agorootparentYep. Your explaination is basically what I was getting at In this case, Telegram showed bad faith moderation.

It would be different if Durov knew but did not report it. Which, again, doesn't seem what happened here and it must be proven in a court anyway, I believe everyone in our western legal systems still has the right to the presumption of innocence.

Great for GDPR because as they aren't acting as processor of PII they are less likley to be taken to court. Whatsapp has about the same level of practical \"privacy\" (encryption is a loaded word here) as iMessage.

That means Telegram is privy to a large amount of the criminal activity happening on their platform but allegedly chooses to turn a blind eye to it, unlike Signal or WhatsApp, who can't see what their users are doing by design. Not to say that deliberately making yourself blind to what's happening on your platform will always be a bulletproof way to avoid liability, but it's a much more defensible position than being able to see the illegal activity on your platform and not doing anything about it.

Why take responsibility for something if you can just offload it to law enforcement? The issue is law enforcement doesn't want that kind of access.

So it goes away and along with it the crime will go back underground where police can pretend it doesn't happen.

Courts are a different case though. reply skissane 7 minutes agorootparentThe English common law tradition has a crime called “misprision”. Misprision of treason is the felony of knowing someone has committed or is about to commit treason but failing to report it to the authorities. It still exists in many jurisdictions, including the UK, the US (it is a federal crime under 18 U.S. Code § 2382, and also a state crime in most states), Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Ireland. Related was the crime “misprision of felony”, which was failure to report a felony (historically treason was not classed as a felony, rather a separate more serious category of crime). Most common law jurisdictions have abolished it, in large part due to the abolition of the felony-misdemeanour distinction. However, in the US (which retains that distinction), it is a federal crime (18 U.S. Code § 4). However, apparently case law has narrowed that offence to require active concealment rather than merely passive failure to report (which was its original historical meaning) Many of the jurisdictions which have abolished misprision of felony still have laws making it a crime not to report certain categories of crime, such as terrorism or child sexual abuse reply lxgr 2 hours agorootparentprevAs a suspect.

At the same time, you can literally open up the app and with 0 effort find everything they are accusing them of - drugs, terrorist organizations, public decapitations, you name it. They also provide the ability to search for people and groups around you, and I am literally seeing a channel where people are buying and selling groups \"800 meters away\" from me and another one for prostitution, which is also illegal in my country. Meanwhile, see their TOS[1]. They have not complied with any of the reports or requests from users (and governments by the looks of it) to crack down on them. While 1:1 chats are theoretically private and encrypted(full disclosure, I do not trust Telegram or any of the people behind it), telegram's security for public channels and groups is absolutely appalling and they are well aware of it - they just chose to look the other way and hope they'd get away with it. You could have given them the benefit of the doubt if those are isolated(\"some\") instances, sure. But just as in the case of Kim Dot-I-support-genocide-com, those are not isolated cases and saying that they had no idea is an obvious lie. 2000/31/EC[2], states that providers are generally not liable for the content they host IF they do not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or content AND upon obtaining such knowledge, they take action and remove and disable access to that content(telegram has been ignoring those). Service providers have no general obligation to monitor but they need to provide notice and take down mechanisms. Assuming that their statement are correct, and they had no idea, they should be in the clear. Telegram provides a notice and take down mechanism. But saying that there are channels with +500k subscribers filled with people celebrating a 4 year old girl with a blown off leg in Ukraine and no one has reported it in 2 and a half years after it was created is indeed naive.

Certainly yes, if \"all\" Telegram was doing was operating a neutral/unmoderated anonymized chat service, then it's hard to see criminal culpability for the reasons you list. But as people are pointing out, that doesn't seem to be technically correct. Telegram isn't completely anonymous, does have access to important customer data, and is widely suspected of complying with third party requests for that data for law enforcement and regulatory reasons. So... IF they are doing that, and they're doing it in a non-neutral/non-anonymized way, then they're very plausibly subject to prosectution.

There is a legal distinction here between what happens on your platform despite your best efforts (what you might call \"incidental\" use) vs what your platform is designed specifically to do or enable. Megaupload is a perfect example. It was used to pirate movies. Everyone knew it. The founders knew it. You can't really argue it's incidental or unintended or simply that small amount that gets past moderation. Telegram, the authorities will argue, fails to moderate CSAM and other illegal activity to the point that it enables it and profits from it, which is legally indistinguishable from specifically designing your platfrom for it. Many tech people fall into a binary mode of thinking because that's how tech usually works. Either your code works or it doesn't. You see it when arguments about people pirating IP being traced to a customer. Tech people will argue \"you can't prove it's me\". While technically true, that's not the legal standard. Legal standards relay on tests. In the ISP case, authorities will look at what was pirated, was it found on your hard drive, was the activity done when you were home or not and so on to establish a balance of probabilities. Is it more likely that all this evidence adds up to your guilt or that an increasingly unlikely set of circumstances explains it where you're innocent? In the early days of Bitcoin I stayed away (to my detriment) because I coudl see the obvious use case of it being used for illegal stuff, whichh it is. The authorities don't currently care. Bitcoin however is the means that enables ransomware. When someone decides this is a national security issue, Bitcoin is in for a bad time.

However, the legal system only functions effectively if we trust that those handling the gray areas are motivated by the common good, rather than serving the interests of a select few or protecting an elite minority. Simply focusing on the arrest and comparing it to the alleged criminal activities on Telegram, along with the supposed lack of enforcement by the company, seems like turning a blind eye. It ignores the more likely reality that this is part of a broader effort to establish a censorship regime, with platforms like TikTok, X, Telegram, and Rumble already targeted. Accepting the official narrative and pretext at face value feels, frankly, a bit naive. reply devman0 2 minutes agorootparentIt's important to note that he has only just been arrested, so there will be a case laid out, a defense offered, facts tried, and ultimately a conviction or not. I don't find a lot of sense in speculating about why or why it didn't happen as that will presumably be surfaced during the trial itself.

On one side there’s actual security professionals saying don’t use Telegram because it’s not fully E2E encrypted, and on the other side there’s people who are convinced that it’s secure because Marketing and that there’s this big conspiracy to stop people from using Telegram. The real conspiracy theory is: Telegram have never made any attempt to either implement full E2E or to dissuade their users for using it for politically sensitive messages. Why not? reply whimsicalism 1 hour agoparentprevultimately this fight against unmonitored messaging is going to be a lost one for the developed world. people who want encrypted group chats will get them reply devman0 1 hour agorootparentAs I hinted at earlier Signal does not have this issue because generally they are not aware of the underlying content. Even if Signal becomes aware of said content, it likely isn't hosted on their servers anymore as their store and forward system is highly transient. The most signal could do is be compelled to block specific users and maybe shutdown certain groups (not sure on that last one, would have to review the group architecture) reply whimsicalism 1 hour agorootparentPrecisely my point - moderated messaging in the modern era will ultimately be unenforceable. Which is why I don’t see why certain services should be legally penalized just because they don’t happen to be E2E encrypted. Like if Telegram was instead e2e encrypted, why should that be legal if what they were previously doing wasn’t? reply devman0 58 minutes agorootparentI think there are two parts to this: 1) On the technical side, Telegram groups operate more like a bulletin board, content is posted and can be fetched over and over again, a bulletin board owner can be compelled to remove material and if non-cooperating considered to be facilitating. Signal is more like a conversation in the town-square or a letter box of sealed envelopes. Once the content is fetched, it's gone. If signal is made aware that certain envelopes contain material that needs to be removed, I'm sure they would do so provided they still possess them. 2) On the non-technical side, many countries have crimes that are all about who knew what and when did they know it and could that have acted (or did they have a duty to do so). Facilitating, accessory, accessory after the fact call it what you will but that's more of a legal / philosophical argument to be had about the legal system in general rather than telegram specifically. A situation were telegram was made aware of illegal activity and was hosting said content in the clear and did nothing is manifestly different from a case where those facts did not exist, in most legal systems. reply Illotus 31 minutes agorootparentprevSo essentially what you are saying that because we couldn't catch the smart criminals who use e2e encrypted services we shouldn't catch the dumb ones either? reply slim 51 minutes agoparentprevNothing more, nothing less Telegram has been operating for years and did not change recently to justify such an action yesterday.

Supposedly, Telegram (and by definition of the french law, the CEO) did not respond to requests for takedown of harmful content (or not enough or faster?) from the the OFMIN. This triggered another investigation looking globally at how Telegram handle content moderation on the public part of Telegram (Channel) which lead to all others charges of complicity.

    "originBody": "Defenders think in lists. Attackers think in graphs. As long as this is true, attackers win. Date: April 26, 2015 Author: @JohnLaTwC Defender Mindset A lot of network defense goes wrong before any contact with an adversary, starting with how defenders conceive of the battlefield. Most defenders focus on protecting their assets, prioritizing them, and sorting them by workload and business function. Defenders are awash in lists of assets—in system management services, in asset inventory databases, in BCDR spreadsheets. There's one problem with all of this. Defenders don't have a list of assets—they have a graph. Assets are connected to each other by security relationships. Attackers breach a network by landing somewhere in the graph using a technique such as spearphishing and they hack, finding vulnerable systems by navigating the graph. Who creates this graph? You do. What Is the Graph? The graph in your network is the set of security dependencies that create equivalence classes among your assets. The design of your network, the management of your network, the software and services used on your network, and the behavior of users on your network all influence this graph. Take a domain controller for example. Bob admins the DC from a workstation. If that workstation is not protected as much as the domain controller, the DC can be compromised. Any other account that is an admin on Bob's workstation can compromise Bob and the DC. Every one of those admins logs on to one or more other machines in the natural course of business. If attackers compromise any of them, they have a path to compromise the DC. Six Degrees of Mallory Attackers can lay in wait on a compromised machine, using a password dumper such as mimikatz until a high value account logs on to the machine. Let's examine an example graph. The cluster on the left is single Terminal Server used by hundreds of users. If attackers compromise this machine, they can dump the credentials of many users over time. How can attackers move laterally to get to the High Value Asset? By searching the graph, attackers discover multiple paths to the High Value Asset. Compromising the terminal server can allow attackers to also compromise User46 and User128. Those users are admins on Machine2821 and Machine115 respectively. Compromising those workstations allows attackers to compromise User1 and User34, both of which are admins on the High Value Asset. For the High Value Asset to be protected, all the dependent elements must be as protected as thoroughly as the HVA—forming an equivalence class. Security Dependencies In a Windows network, when users perform certain kinds of logons (Interactive, Terminal Server, and others), those users' credentials (and single-sign-on equivalents such as a Kerberos TGT or NTLM hash) are exposed to theft if the underlying host is compromised. Beyond this, there are many kinds of relationships that create security dependencies: Local admin accounts with a common password. Compromise one system, dump the local admin password, and use that password on other hosts with the same password. File servers housing logon scripts that run for many users and software update servers. Print servers that deliver print drivers to client machines when used. Certificate authorities that issue certificates valid for smart card logons. Database admins that can run code under the context of a database server running as a privileged user. And so on. There are indirect relations as well. A machine that has a vulnerability can be compromised, suddenly allowing attackers to create new edges in the graph. Or users may have an account in two untrusted domains with the same password, creating a hidden edge between domains. Manage your Graph What can you do as a defender? The first step is to visualize your network by turning your lists into graphs. Next, implement controls to prune the graph: Examine unwanted edges that create huge connectivity bursts. Implement infrastructure partitioning and credential silos to reduce them. Reduce the number of admins. Use Just-In-Time / Just Enough techniques for privilege minimization. Use two factor authentication to mitigate certain edge traversals. Apply a solid credential rotation approach in case a user account is compromised. Rethink forest trust relationships. Learn to Spot List Thinking Defenders need to ensure that attackers don't have a leg up on them when visualizing the battlefield. In this contest, defenders can have the upper hand. They can have full information about their own network, whereas attackers need to study the network piece by piece. Defenders should take a lesson from how attackers come to understand the graph. Attackers study the infrastructure as it is—not as an inaccurate mental model, viewed from an incomplete asset inventory system, or a dated network diagram. Manage from reality because that's the prepared Defenders Mindset. Further Reading There are a number of papers about attack graphs.

Without having \"defenders\" post in random places along the graph looking for interesting activity, I don't know how they'll be able to \"think in graphs\". To wit, the suggestions that the author made would be, you guessed it, signals in a list that a \"defender\" would check against! reply beardedwizard 4 hours agoparentI disagree with this. In my experience we saw the red team use graph techniques to plot paths to high value assets over and over, where defenders were not even thinking about this approach. As soon as they did, they identified potential attacks before the red team launched them. Smart teams will immediately adopt the red team technology that, for example, crawls AWS as a graph looking for paths to from low to high value accounts. Its not a zero sum or sea change thing, but defenders absolutely can think more like attackers and leverage attacker tools more often in the act of defense. reply uberman 3 hours agorootparentHow do you define and track high values assets?

What do you do when you have to manage a ton of things? You make a list. You go through that list. You apply a checklist. Now should defenders also make dependency graphs too? Sure, but they should be making lists first before dependency graphs and making sure things are up to date, that they assume limited trust, and that resources are isolated. Then they should make dependency graphs. “Defenders have to think in list and graphs and manage a billion things.

The component view is analysis, the interaction view - well we don't have a really good word for that, and yet as the article points out, that is often the attack surface. Complex adaptive systems (see John Holland's \"Hidden Order\") have components and a messaging bus which crucially provides a way for the constituent components to interoperate. You can swat ants individually, but if you want to stop them, you destroy the ability to leave pheromone trails. Maybe there should be a word like \"analysis\" for understanding how things interoperate. Gestaltysis? reply tpmoney 18 hours agoprevI feel like this goes too deep. Or maybe it hits on the right reason, but the wrong cause. The defender’s job isn’t defense. Cyber security isn’t a sportsball game where there are clear even goals and objectives with alternating positions. It’s a side show, and a distraction from the main business of whatever else the defenders are trying to do. By contrast, an attacker’s entire job is to attack the system. There is no other purpose they are serving, no secondary masters or considerations that need to be used to weaken their attacks. Attackers win for the same reason that Microsoft is better at publishing operating systems than Cisco, because ciscos operating systems are a means to an end. Microsoft’s are the end reply vishnugupta 6 hours agoparentThis is well put. I think one way to drive home the point is defenders are cost centers and attackers are profit centers. reply amelius 14 hours agoparentprevI think the main problem is that most organizations put security at the end of the budget list. reply tpmoney 14 hours agorootparentEven if they put it near the top, it's still going to be reduced in effectiveness by the actual needs and goals of the organization. Any company that has a VPN and remote employees is objectively and inherently weaker from a cyber security standpoint than an otherwise equally equipped company with no external access to the network. But they do that because remote employee access means they can do their actual business better. Any company that uses networked computers in objectively and inherently weaker from a cyber security standpoint than one which requires physically moving data from one machine to another by way of personal handoffs between employees at the same physical location, but they do that because it means they can do their actual business better. It does not matter if cyber security is at the top or the bottom of your budget list, if the choice is ever \"better cyber security\" or \"do more business\", cyber security is always going to lose that battle. You will never convince a company to use E2E encrypted email for all communications with all customers and vendors, no matter how high on the budget list cyber security is, because doing so would actively hinder the day to day operations of the business. reply Archelaos 8 hours agorootparentThe parent wrote that \"most organizations put security at the end of the budget list\", but he did not write that it should be put at the top of the budget list. Your criticism would only be valid if he had written the latter. reply tpmoney 3 hours agorootparentThe parent wrote that the \"main problem\" was that they put the security at the end of the budget list. My argument is it doesn't matter where it is on the budget list, it will always be subservient to the actual business of the Defender. That is, my argument is the \"main problem\" is that perfect cyber security Defense isn't anyone's actual business. reply TheColorYellow 13 hours agorootparentprevI don't think this is relevant. Even on-prem \"air gapped\" networks get breached. I would say it happens on as frequent a basis as any other network tbh. Microsoft hacks get headlines because Microsoft is a public company; there are lots of undisclosed breaches happening out there. Security vulnerabilities come from the same place they always have. Where IO happens, where transactions happen, and where an operating system does a lot of work. How attackers get to these points, what happens when they do, and then how the system reacts when a malicious event occurs are the factors that matter. In today's world of complex technologies, I have yet to meet a single organization that is invulnerable to these threats. I've seen a lot of organizations limit damage, patch vulnerabilities, and generally manage their risk profile effectively - but losses are a part of the business. IMO, the only thing that will really make a difference is when we have technologies that are sufficient enough to male the user more resilient. Only then can we have a truly safer web. reply Wowfunhappy 8 hours agorootparent> I would say it happens on as frequent a basis as any other network tbh. ...really? I find this extremely hard to believe on its face. Sure an attacker can infect a system via a USB drive, but they need to get physically close to the victim (at least at one point in time). That both dramatically decreases the number of possible attackers and increases their personal risk. It also becomes far more difficult for an attacker to exfiltrate any data. reply TeMPOraL 7 hours agorootparentExfil may be tricky if the system is actually airgapped - I take GP's use of scare quotes to mean that most systems are \"airgapped\" by means of software-enforced security policies, which should correctly be referred to as \"not airgapped\". As for the attack method, there's always the good ol' \"flash drive found on a parking lot\" vector. reply Wowfunhappy 6 hours agorootparent> As for the attack method, there's always the good ol' \"flash drive found on a parking lot\" vector. Right, which requires the attacker to be physically near the parking lot at some point! That decreases the number of possible attackers by several orders of magnitude at least. > Exfil may be tricky if the system is actually airgapped - I take GP's use of scare quotes to mean that most systems are \"airgapped\" by means of software-enforced security policies, which should correctly be referred to as \"not airgapped\".

I do think tpmoney was quite clearly talking about truly airgapped systems, however. Very much so. My point being that a truly air gapped system is objectively more secure than one that is networked, and yet, a bank or social network company that only operates with truly air gapped systems will be strictly worse off than their competitors in their actual business of banking or social networking. And so since their actual job is not objectively better cyber security, but banking or social networking, then they are inherently at a disadvantage compared to Attackers whose business IS attacking (or at one step removed, selling the resources obtained from attacking). In the name of making their business better, Defenders will chose weaker security, and attackers will chose stronger attacks. reply cutemonster 6 hours agorootparentprevYeah, GP is sort of saying that seat belts are pointless since traffic fatalities can happen anyway reply tpmoney 5 hours agorootparentprevMy point is that the vulnerable points, regardless of where they come from, are ultimately there because the purpose of the Defender is not to have perfect cyber security, but to use computers and technology to enable business. Or as you said, \"losses are a part of the business\"; and that's so because \"the business\" isn't cyber security. reply awkward 5 hours agorootparentprevIf this is true, big if, it’s because air gapping doesn’t happen without a specific threat model in mind.

I have worked at 20+ companies and the ones that had little to no security got ransomwared at LEAST yearly (with 50m+ in revenues) and the ones that had basic and standard security practices got zero network wide intrusions (at least at lower then say, a nation state level.) Now, COULD they have been exploited with an 0day? Sure, in theory these networks could be both exploited with the same technology or by a dedicated actor likely without an issue - they're internet connected corporate networks mostly with probably out of date tech; and in practice most attacks corporations need to mitigate are the drive by trash that consumers also face. reply lifeisstillgood 10 hours agorootparentprevI’m sorry but I really really really want some citations here - a network that has VPNs, LANs at multiple locations is as vulnerable as a single location that uses air-gapped computers passing say usb sticks around to share say git repos.

Here's a question: Why do most safety regulations require the force of law to get companies to enact, but no laws were necessary to get companies to adopt the internet? \"Safety\" is in a similar boat to security, with the benefit that you usually don't have people actively trying to harm your employees. But Safety often gets tossed out the window when it gets in the way of accomplishing the real goals of the organization. Why is the US military exempt from a number of safety regulations that private companies are beholden to? Because the military believes those regulations will hamper their real mission, which is not keeping individual soldiers safe. reply TeMPOraL 4 hours agorootparentIndeed.

It doesn’t matter if it’s a cost or a profit center. It’s part of a trade off. You could achieve a perfectly secure system, if and only if you make that system do exactly nothing.

Nowadays their purpose has some sort of monetization component, therefore there is consideration as to which attack vectors seem to be the most likely to lead to the kind of a monetization scheme they are targeting on. For example does a group of attackers ransoming companies prefer the same attacks as phishing individuals? Are these the same companies / groups (I prefer companies at this point, they are organized crime, they are a company and have the same sort of problems in that any small company have in deciding where to put their resources - we don't have a phishing division here, we ransom data, we don't denial of service - nobody is paying us for that, we ransom data and that's it!) reply tpmoney 5 hours agorootparentSure, the final business goal is selling access to the resources gained by the attack, but ultimately the attacking IS aligned with/directly enables that goal.

Even with \"defense in depth\", there's clear separation between parts that do the important stuff, and parts that protect the parts that do the important stuff from being used against the rules. I'd go as far as dividing cybersecurity into two major areas of concern: 1) The part that constrains software systems to conform to some make-believe reality with rules stricter than natural -- this is trying to make the abstract world function more like physical reality we're used to; 2) The rules and policies - who can access what, when, why, and what for. Area 1) should very much be a bolt-on third-party thing everyone should ideally take for granted. Area 2) is a responsibility of each organization/project individually, but it also small and mostly limited to issues specific to that organization/project. It maps to physical reality like this: Area 1) are the reinforced walls, floor and ceiling, and blast doors that can only be opened via a key card[0]; Area 2) are the policies and procedures of giving and revoking keycards to specific people in the company. -- [0] - Or by crossing some wires deep in the reader, because accidents happen and cutting through blast doors cost money.

Your viewpoint might apply to unsophisticated actors who just want to break things and cause chaos, but it’s completely ignorant when considering nation-state actors and financially motivated criminals. reply tpmoney 14 hours agorootparentYes, but that purpose is accomplished by way of attacking the system. By comparison, most cyber security defense gets in the way of the purpose of the defenders. We know this, and even joke about it openly. The ultimate secure system is a computer unplugged, sealed in a lead vault, encased in concrete and buried a mile beneath the surface. It might not be useful, but it is completely secure. Even less flippantly though, we inherently know this. How many things do we do every day that could be \"more secure\", but \"more secure\" gets in the way? Do you use memorize 256 character unique passwords for every site and system and refuse to record them even in a password manager? Do you use GPG encrypted emails and only E2E encrypted messaging services? Are all your home network devices independently fire walled, with strict in AND outbound rules ensuring they can only talk to the specific devices they should be able to talk to and only on specific well defined ports? Have you hardened your home network against data exfiltration via DNS queries? Is all network traffic fully encrypted with mutual client and server cert validations? If you've answered no to any of these questions, you have chosen to prioritize something else over better cyber security defense. And it's probably a good bet that at least some of that is because doing these things would actively get in the way of doing what you actually want to do with your electronic devices. You've knowingly chosen a weaker defensive stance to do something else instead. Attackers on the other hand have no need to choose weaker attacks on your defenses in order to do something else instead. The attack is the point of their usage of their devices (and yours). You might argue that the attacker might choose a lesser profile in order to remain hidden and beneath detection, but I would argue this still isn't the same choice. Given the option, no company would spend any time or money on resources for cyber defense. They would rather spend all that time and money on their actual business.

There are security teams whose budget is in the 100's of millions of dollars and who employ some of the brightest cybersecurity strategists and professionals. You rarely (if ever) hear their names in relation to a breach or compromise. There are also much less capable security teams who do well against most attackers, but will inevitably get pwned by an APT, except the good defenders catch the apt's before they cause significant damage. At well protected organizations, attackers lose 99.9% of the time (probably higher, I'm guessing here). Attackers simply need to win once to succeed, while defenders need to succeed 100% of the time. reply scapecast 13 hours agorootparentThere is also Fix Inventory, which is a graph-based security tool: https://github.com/someengineering/fixinventory I'm one of the people behind Fix Inventory. What scares a lot of developers away from graph-based tools is the graph query language. It has a steep learning curve, and unless you write queries every day, it's really cumbersome to learn.

Obviously! > I'm sorry, but what else are defenders trying to do that isn't defense? are all defenders completely incompetent then? You've misunderstood me. Defenders aren't the \"cyber security team employed by AT&T to keep customer data secure\". The Defenders are AT&T, who would rather spend their cyber security budget on just about anything else that could actually generate a profit. The cyber security team that AT&T hires might have the sole job of building the most robust defense system imagined, but even if they do, their efforts will be continuously stymied and reduced because true, complete, robust security will get in the way of actually doing the things the AT&T wants to do.

The attackers also work for organizations. It is a bit rare for individuals to hack companies these days. APTs are teams, sometimes they are employed by intelligence or military units of countries, other times they are employed by a criminal organization and yet other times they are loosely formed organizations between individuals with a financial or political goal, like hacktivists as an example. But they have hierarchy, motive, goals, even a work schedule and paid vacations and bonuses. Even for individual hackers, there are individual good hackers (commonly called \"whitehat\" although I deride that term) doing bug bounties and finding CVEs.

Yes, that's why companies cut cost on security guards as much as they possibly can.

When the homedepot security team tried to fix the issues that got them pwned, the execs said \"we're not a security company, we sell hammers\". Box ticking mindsets like that are held by incompetent and short sighted executives. The cost of security is decided by the cost of a potential compromise, it has nothing to do with profit margins. A lot of companies learn this lesson the hard way. Many \"snakeoil\" security companies exist because of this incompetent line of thinking by executives. It is easier to say you paid some company who made some b.s. claim than to actually fix problems, even if the 3rd party costs more than the cost of fixing problems.

Therefore, businesses will *always* trade weaker cyber security defense for better/faster/cheaper/easier/more business in their actual line of business. Just like you do every single day. Do you have ALL traffic on your home network encrypted with mutual serve and client certificate verification? Do you only have your 256 character passwords memorized in your head and not stored in a password manager anywhere or otherwise recored somewhere? Are all of your home systems equipped with strict outbound firewall rules that only allow one time, on demand and confirmed communications with the wider internet? Have you hardened your home network against data exfiltration via DNS queries[1]? If you use 2FA for your accounts, and the objectively weaker password managers to store your passwords, are your 2FA tokens kept on completely separate devices from your password managers? Do you only allow direct console access to any of your systems and have no remote access like SSH enabled? Do you a have every single computer backing up their data into multiple redundant copies, without using the network for data transfer and with at least one if not more of those copies stored off site? If you answered \"No\" to any of those questions, you also have chosen the route of \"incompetency\" and \"mismanagement\". It's 2024, and every IT person should know better. But of course we do \"know better\" and choose the objectively weaker options anyway because the stronger options get in the way of actually doing the things we want to use our systems for. You don't choose perfect cyber security defense for your home network because you don't have a home network for the purpose of practicing perfect cyber security defense.

For instance, developing effective controls to reduce the risk and impact of a security event, identifying attacks and compromise, and responding to the events. Lists of standards and responses work well. Defense also includes architectural decisions which require thinking about the graph of the network to develop these controls. There are lots of disciplines in defense too: architecture/engineering, risk management, incident response, application security, education, threat intelligence, and so on.

Companies buy these tools as a kind of blast door for when things go wrong, to point a finger at. “We followed all the checklists and our security software didn’t catch it, it’s not our fault.” If companies cared about security they would hire red teams instead of paying for useless scanners with aBob admins the DC from a workstation. If that workstation is not protected as much as the domain controller, the DC can be compromised. They both run Windows. The protection class between the two is identical. You can draw as many graphs and lists as you want, but the security of this arrangement is mostly down to timely and accurate Windows Updates. > Learn to Spot List Thinking I think in terms of \"diffs.\" I want to know what is _changing_ on my network. I don't ever need an enumeration of things in any particular arrangement and as a human being, whether graph or list, I'm not equipped to use it in any meaningful way. A difference list is typically very short, reveals intrusion patterns quickly, and is something you can automate easily. reply StressedDev 13 hours agoparentYou can do a lot more than just keep Windows up to date. Here are some other things you should do: 1) Use separate accounts and machines for administration tasks. Basically, IT people should never use their e-mail, web browsing, and development machine for system management tasks. They should use a separate machine with a different account for these tasks. The main reason is the system management machine has a much smaller attack surface. Ideally, it should only run a communications program (IRC, Slack, MS Teams, etc.), and the tools the person needs to do their job. Examples of tools people need include SSH, Remote Desktop, kubectl (Kubernetes tool to manage a cluster), etc. The machine should have a web browser BUT the web browser should be restricted to the bare minimum number of sites needed to administer the systems. Examples of acceptable sites include the Azure Portal, the AWS web site, web sites to configure equipment, etc. Examples of things which are not allowed include web mail, documentation, etc. The goal is to have the smallest possible attack surface. 2) People need to be mindful of what they install on their machines. I have seen a lot of people who will install anything which looks useful on their machine. This is a great way to get hacked. Here are the questions people need to ask before installing software. - Why do I trust the people who wrote the software? - Why was the software created? What was the motivation of the author? - How does the author support himself or herself? What would happen if one of the authors was in financial distress? - How will I know when the software needs to be updated? - What are the capabilities of the software's authors? Do the authors understand how to write secure software? How do the authors handle security bug reports? Basically, you ask these questions because you want to avoid malware, and you want to use software which fixes its security problems. 3) Consider putting system management machines on a different network or VPN. Basically, it's harder to hack a machine if you can't easily communicate with it. 4) System management machines should not be listening on any ports (or should have a firewall which blocks all connection attempts). It's harder to break into a machine when an attacker cannot connect to it. 5) Put the system management machines behind a firewall. 6) Consider what happens when an account is eventually hacked. Many people assume that only dumb or incompetent people get hacked. Unfortunately, this is not true. Systems should be designed to assume accounts will get hacked. The best designs limit the blast radius (damage) of account attacks. 7) All users should have limited privileges. Basically, they should get the privileges they need to do their jobs. Very few people should be allowed to have the equivalent of root/Administrator for the entire system (obviously, people may have these permissions for some machines but almost no account should be able to do anything on any system the organization runs). reply akira2501 13 hours agorootparentWhat I meant is even doing all this you're effectively a single 0-day away from total compromise and are now dependent on specific workarounds or on getting the update that patches the vulnerability. Because of this I can't consider the security of the AD as any better or worse than the desktop that connects to it and it's pointless to pretend that you can even have this. We did have a crypto locker that spread on our network this way between our AD machines. It was launched from an email in the sales department, but due to an unpatched RDP credential attack, it quickly got onto the ADs then spread across the entire WAN. I'm not saying don't do the things you're suggesting but you should prepare the scenario where none of it matters. So one thing you missed which we now have is: WAN KILL SWITCH. reply dwattttt 9 hours agorootparentI dunno about that; it sounds like a PC in your sales department could connect to the RDP port on the AD, and the listed controls would have prevented that (RDP port on the DC should be firewalled down to the machines administrators use to connect to them, which per the comment should _not_ include access to emails, just in case the compromise you're describing was actually an email from sales -> system administrator). reply lmeyerov 16 hours agoprevA formal way to frame this insight is how a formal methods security researcher might: graph-based program verification. A lot of core confidentiality and integrity security problems come down to 'safety property' verification (a notion from model checking), which in turn comes down to reachability on a program flow graph (a notion from program analysis). This is also true of access control verification, but that's a topic for another day. Imagine a dataflow or points-to analysis on a program, and extend it all the way to include the code in your OS and the cloud and the database. These analyses create a graph, and the question is can an attacker get from an entrypoint and precondition of some node A (a line of code) and traverse to the assets on point B (another line of code.) Interestingly, the security field is increasingly getting there, with ideas like CNAPP, IAM/Cedar, AD/bloodhound, where we are getting these basic access graphs modulated by estate, identity, access policy, etc. Often we don't even really need the programs, because it's more about a distributed system where we can focus just on identities and policies across trust zones. (Eg, If a box gets hacked, that exposes other credentials on the same box.) At the same time, anyone working in these things also knows graph reachability is simplistic 80's & 90's stuff: there can be complex logical policies at each node, So we're seeing things like modeling those harder points, not just as pure reachability, But also things we can actually peek into and more richly verify, such as by modeling fancy ABAC policies using smt solvers. I don't think that's really where the author is coming from, but it's a reason the article resonated with me for so many years from a principled perspective, and I think it's incredibly practical and important today. (Disclaimer: we do crazy GPU graph AI power tools for folks in the space at Graphistry / Louie.AI, in my first verification papers here were almost 20 years ago, so I've been thinking about this a lot.) reply notepad0x90 16 hours agoprevDefenders also think in graphs. Matter of fact, good defenders think like attackers. Case in point, to contradict the author of this post directly: https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound BloodHound is primarily a defender tool, that uses graph theory to help defenders find attack paths. But attackers also use it to help them find the shortest path to owning an AD domain. BloodHound is used in by a lot of threat actors as part of those news stories where the entire company is ransomwared. But what you don't see is, in a lot of companies that don't get totally ransomwared, there is a chance defenders are also using BloodHound to find and fix attack paths. reply batch12 16 hours agoparentThis true.

They are additive rather than substitutive, and immanent rather than transcendent: executed by functional complexes of currents, switches, and loops, caught in scaling reverberations, and fleeing through intercommunications, from the level of the integrated planetary system to that of atomic assemblages.

So attackers win. reply skimmilk_ 17 hours agoparentDo you think this still applies? My take as an attacker: it goes directly against the security 101 of \"defence in depth\". Sure, we only have to win once for a specific step, but then there are more steps to complete for us to reach our goal. This is the same for most occupations that I can think of anyway, no one reaches their goal with one step. I understand that this can be taken to mean there are multiple avenues to achieve a certain objective (e.g. I can find a password on disk multiple ways), but I still wouldn't agree. Develop a defence that makes sense (e.g. MFA is a good mitigation for password theft). Detect / alert on the usage rather than the endless list of methods to retrieve a password. reply hypeatei 17 hours agorootparentIt's still a \"loss\" from the defenders perspective even if someone can't compromise other systems. The defenders still need to assess the damage, fix the vulnerability, and verify that nothing was compromised regardless of what protections are in place. For example, maybe the attacker is after trade secrets but compromises the CMS (content management system) of your public website. It has no connection to your intranet, but they were able to change download links and inject scripts for visitors of your website. Still a \"win\" as they now have a place to pivot from or just use to their liking. It gives the attacker options while your system is left weakened with less options. reply CoastalCoder 18 hours agoparentprevI wonder if this could change if our governments' policy was to hunt would-be hackers to the ends of the earth.

It would take a crazy amount of resources, like sending in infiltration teams into hostile countries. It is technically possible, but where is the balancing point? reply bluGill 17 hours agorootparentWhat will you do when you find them? if you find one in say France, the French will deal with it and attacks stop. However most attacks are tracedto North Korea or Russia where they don't care and so you can't do anything. reply makeitdouble 14 hours agorootparentprevThe balance might not change much: - some hackers are state actors, and pointing the finger to North Korea won't help much - some live in precarious conditions from the start, in areas where gov is unreliable. Even if you catch a bunch of them, it might not disuade others to try their chance if there's no other obvious jackpot to them. - When the risk increases the reward can also increase as the barrier to entry is that much higher. You get a hacker scene with more high profile, super professional actors that will get more organized. Think \"war on drug\" style of underground actors building cell networks to manage their operations. reply bsder 18 hours agorootparentprev> I wonder if this could change if our governments' policy was to hunt would-be hackers to the ends of the earth. \"Security\" has a cost. The only question is whether the cost of security exceeds the cost of lack of security. Currently, lack of security has very little cost.

Computers and the cybersecurity industry are passions of mine. Im apalled at how badly threat actors are ruining things and I just feel like it takes a hacker to catch a hacker. I've dabbled but never become serious enough to get the required education. Frankly to my way of thinking that involves, ( aside from all the playing around with what one can break), learning a programming language. So I'm slogging through C. But honestly I believe it is the constraints of societal perceptions that most hinders the security industry from doing better. They tie their own hands by playing \"good guy\" within the framework of certain rules themselves formulated out of overcaution, while the \"bad guys\" run rampant, operating effectively without constraints. Most likely despite all the effort and knowledge I will have eventually accumulated as the criteria for being qualified no person or company will ever hire me. I spent a number of years in several states incarcerated in the penal system for crimes entirely unrelated to this industry nevertheless rendering me unfit as far as any firm is concerned to work in the cyber security industry. Even though an education coupled with a map of the criminal mind because of my experiences would be an unbeatable combination (nearly..lol) the fear that abides in the heart of the defenders will be the reason they will always stay one or more steps behind. The idea that reform is not only possible but that SOME of us so abhor the way we once were that we are now staunch bulldogs on the side of morality is an idea entirely unknown in this country currently.

This kind of error is especially hard to notice because you're so impressed that Claude managed to do the extract task at all -- plus the results look wholly plausible upon eyeballing -- that you wouldn't expect anything to be wrong at all. But LLMs can get things ever slightly wrong when it comes to long lists/tables. I've been bitten by this before. Trust but verify. (edit: if the answer is \"machine verifiable\", one approach to ask an LLM to write a Python validator which it can execute internally. ChatGPT can execute code. I believe Sonnet 3.5 can too, but I haven't tried.) reply disillusioned 10 hours agoparentThe \"off by one\" predilection of LLMs is going to lead to this massive erosion of trust in whatever \"Truth\" is supposed to be, and it's terrifying and going to make for a bumpy couple of years. (Or the complete collapse of objective knowledge, on a long enough time horizon.) It's one thing to ask an LLM when George Washington was born, and have it return \"May 20, 2020.\" It's another thing to ask it, and have it matter-of-factly hallucinate \"February 20, 1733.\" At first glance, that... sounds right, right? President's Day is in February, and has something to do with his birthday? And that year seems to check out? Good enough! But it's not right. And it's the confidence and bravado with which LLMs report these \"facts\" that's terrifying. It just misstates information, calculations, and detail work, because the stochastic model compelled it to, and there wasn't sufficient checks in place to confirm or validate the information. Trust but verify is one of those things that's so paradoxical and cyclical: if I have to confirm every fact ChatGPT gives me with... what I hope is a higher source of truth like Wikipedia, before it's overrun with LLM outputs... then why don't I just start there? If I have to build a validator in Python to verify the output then... why not just start there? We're going to see some major issues crop up from this sort of insidious error, but the hard part about off-by-ones is that they're remarkably difficult to detect, and so what will happen is data will slowly corrupt and take us further and further off course, and we won't notice until it's too late. We should be so lucky that all of LLMs' garbage outputs look like glue on pizza recommendations, but the reality is, it'll be a slow, seeping poisoning of the well, and when this inaccurate output starts sneaking into parts of our lives that really matter... we're probably well and truly fucked. reply stavros 9 hours agorootparentThis is semi-offtopic, but \"trust but verify\" is an oxymoron. Trusting something means I don't have to verify whether it's correct (I trust that it is), so the saying, in the end, is \"don't verify but verify\". reply msabalau 5 hours agorootparentPragmatically, the statement was made famous in English by a conservative US president, addressing the nation, including his supporters, who trusted him, but not the Soviets with whom he was negotiating. Saying, in effect: \"you trust in me, I'm choosing to trust that it makes sense to make agreement with the USSR, and we are going to verify it, just as we would with any serious business, as is proverbially commonsensical\" is a perfectly intelligible.

It's not even used like that in the original Russian, where Reagan lifted it from. reply AmericanChopper 4 hours agorootparentprevI think that’s a rather peculiar interpretation. I always thought it was pretty obvious that Reagan was just saying that he didn’t trust the soviets, and found a polite excuse not to in the form of the Russian proverb. reply IWeldMelons 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is not quite true. \"Trust\" is to give a permission for someone to act on achieving some result. \"Verify\" means assess the achieved result, and correct aposteriori the probability with which said person is able to achieve the abocementioned result. This is the way Bayesian reasoning works. Trust has degrees. What you have brought is \"unconditional trust\". Very rarely works. reply stavros 5 hours agorootparent> \"Trust\" is to give a permission for someone to act on achieving some result. This would make the sentence \"I asked him to wash the dishes properly, but I don't trust him\", as your definition expands this to \"I asked him to wash the dishes properly, but I didn't give him permission to achieve this result\". If you say \"I asked someone to do X but I don't trust them\", it means you aren't confident they'll do it properly, thus you have to verify. If you say \"I asked him to do X and I trust him, so I don't need to check up on him\", it's unlikely to leave people puzzled. It's surprising to me to see this many comments arguing against the common usage of trust, just because of a self-conflicting phrase. reply neom 5 hours agorootparentWhy could I not say \"I trusted him to do the dishes properly, after he was done, I verified, it's a good thing I trusted him to do the dishes properly, my supervision would have been unwarranted and my trust was warranted?\" I trusted someone to do their task correctly, after the task was done, I verified my trust was warranted. reply stavros 2 hours agorootparentWhat would be different if you didn't trust them to do it correctly? reply jrflowers 8 hours agorootparentprevYep. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify reply SoftTalker 2 hours agorootparentprevThat's only one possible meaning of the word \"trust,\" i.e. a firm belief. Trust can also mean leaving something in the care of another, and it can also mean relying on something in the future, neither of these precludes a need to verify. Edit: jgalt212 says in another reply that it's also the English translation of a Russian idiom. Assuming that's true, that would make a lot of sense in this context, since the phrase was popularized by Reagan talking about nuclear arms agreements with the USSR. It would be just like him to turn a Russian phrase around on them. It's somewhat humorous, but also conveys \"I know how you think, don't try to fool me.\" reply Diti 8 hours agorootparentprevFrench armed forces have a better version of this saying. “Trust does not exclude control.” They’re still going to check for explosives under cars that want to park in French embassies. reply RandomThoughts3 8 hours agorootparentIt’s interesting to notice that etymologically speaking the French and English words have completely different roots and therefore evokes slightly different ideas which are lost in translation. Trust shares its root with truth. It’s directly related to believing in the veracity of something. Confiance comes from the Latin confidere which means depositing something to someone while having faith they are going to take good care of it. The accent is on the faith in the relationship, not the truthfulness. The tension between trust and control doesn’t really exist in French. You can have faith but still check. reply mathgeek 6 hours agorootparent> Trust shares its root with truth. It’s directly related to believing in the veracity of something. Would you mind sharing your reference on that? All the etymology sites I rely on seem to place the root in words that end up at \"solid\" or \"comfort\". reply RandomThoughts3 6 hours agorootparentDefinitely and that’s not incompatible with what I’m saying. You are indeed looking far back to the Proto-Indo-European where words are very different and sometimes a bit of guesses. If you look at the whole tree, you will see that both trust, truth and true share common Germanic roots (that’s pretty obvious by looking at them) which is indeed linked with words meaning “solid” and then “promise, contract”. What’s interesting is that the root is shared between “truth” and “trust” while in French it’s not (vérité from veritas vs confiance from confere). reply hoistbypetard 7 hours agorootparentprevI think a better translation of \"control\" in that saying is \"checking\" or \"testing\". \"Control\" in present-day English is a false cognate there. reply cromka 9 hours agorootparentprevA better phrase would be “Use it but verify”, simply. reply stavros 9 hours agorootparentYes, which boils down to \"verify\". reply cj 8 hours agorootparentIt's possible to trust (or have faith) in my car being able to drive another 50k miles without breaking down. But if I bring it to a mechanic to have the car inspected just in case, does that mean I never had trust/faith in the car to begin with? \"I trust my coworkers write good code, but I verify with code reviews\" -- doing code reviews doesn't mean you don't trust your coworker. Yet another way to look at it: people can say things they believe to be true but are actually false (which isn't lying). When that happens, you can successfully trust someone in the sense that they're not lying to you, but the absence of a lie doesn't guarantee a truth, so verifying what you trust to be true doesn't invalidate your trust. reply stavros 8 hours agorootparentWe're getting into the definition of trust, but to me trust means exactly \"I don't need to verify\". If I say I trust you to write correct code, I don't mean \"I'm sure your mistakes won't be intentional\", I mean \"I'm sure you won't have mistakes\". If I need to check your code for mistakes, I don't trust you to write correct code. I don't know anyone who will hear \"I trust you to write correct code, now let me make sure it's correct\" and think \"yes, this sentence makes sense\". reply rpdillon 6 hours agorootparent> to me trust means exactly \"I don't need to verify\". If you use the slightly weaker definition that trust means you have confidence in someone, then the adage makes sense. reply stavros 5 hours agorootparentThe issue here is that the only value of the adage is in the sleight of hand it lets you perform. If someone asks \"don't you trust me?\" (ie \"do you have to verify what I do/say?\"), you can say \"trust, but verify!\", and kind of make it sound like you do trust them, but also you don't really. The adage doesn't work under any definition of trust other than the one it's conflicting with itself about. reply rpdillon 1 hour agorootparentI think I just provided an example where it makes sense.

Absolute trust is a rare thing, but people have given examples of relative trust. Your car won't break down and you can trust it with your kids' life, almost never challenging its trustworthiness, but still you can do checkups or inspections, because some of the bult-in redundancies might be strained. Trusting aircraft but still doing inspections. Trusting your colleagues to do their best but still doing reviews because every fucks up once in a while.

Your comment just showed an example of something I don't trust and asked \"why not trust instead\"?

I'm sure there will be an epidemic of these issues in a few years, because developers are definitely lazy enough to rely on it. reply morsch 9 hours agorootparentprev> why not just start there? Because there are many categories of problems where it's much easier to verify a solution than it is to come up with it. This is true in computer science, but also more generally. Having an LLM restructure a document as a table means you have to proofread it, but it may be less tedious than doing it yourself. I agree that asking straightforward factual questions isn't one of those cases much like I agree with most of your post. reply ardaoweo 7 hours agorootparentprevAlready quite a while ago I was entertained by a particular British tabloid article, which had been \"AI edited\". Basically the article was partially correct, but then it went badly wrong because the subject of the article was about recent political events that had happened some years after the point where LLM's training data ended. Because of this, the article contained several AI-generated contextual statements about state of the world that had been true two years ago, but not anymore. They quietly fixed the article only after I pointed its flaws out to them. I hope more serious journalists don't trust AI so blindly. reply SoftTalker 3 hours agorootparentprevMaybe it will be analogous to steel. For most of the post-nuclear age, steel has been contaminated with radionuclides from atmospheric nuclear weapon use and testing. To get \"low background\" steel you had to recycle steel that was made before 1945. Maybe to fact-check information we'll eventually have to go to textbooks or online archives that were produced before 2023. (Steel contamination has slowly become less of an issue as most of the fallout elements have decayed by now. Maybe LLMs will get better and eventually the hallucinated \"facts\" will get weeded out. Or maybe we'll have an occasional AI \"Chernobyl\" that will screw everything up again for a while.) reply ravetcofx 2 hours agorootparentBecause of llm Internet we have today, I already do go out of my way to find books and information that I can audit were written by a human before GPT. reply ks2048 9 hours agorootparentprevOff topic, but a funny thing about asking about George Washington's birthday is there are two possible answers because of British calendar reform in 1750 (although we've settled on recognizing the new-style date as his birthday). footnote [a] on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#cite_note-3 reply kovezd 2 hours agorootparentprev> The \"off by one\" predilection of LLMs is going to lead to this massive erosion of trust in whatever \"Truth\" is supposed to be, and it's terrifying and going to make for a bumpy couple of years. This sounds like searching for truth is a bad thing, but instead is what has triggered every philosophical enquiry in history. I'm quiet bullish, and think that LLMs will lead to a Renaissance in the concept of truth. Similar to what Wittgenstein did, Plato's cavern or late middle age empiricists. reply wiltonn 6 hours agorootparentprevAgree with this sentiment, erosion of trust and potential issues. The illusion of facts and knowledge is a great moral hazard that AI companies are willing to step around while the market share battles play out. More responsible AI companies, stronger government policy, better engineering and less dumb users are all part of the solution here. This is more solvable from an engineering perspective if we don't take the approach that LLMs are a hammer and everything is a nail. The solution I think is along the lines of breaking the issue down into 2-3 problems: 1) Understand the intent of question, 2) Validating the data in resultset and 3) provide a signal to the user of the measure to which the result matches the intent of the intention. LLMs work great to understand the intent of the request; To me this is the magic of LLM - when I ask, it understands what I'm looking for as opposed to google has no idea, here's a bunch of blue links - you go figure it out. However, more validation of results is required. Before answers are returned, I want the result validated with a trusted source. Trust is a hard problem..and probably not in the purview of the LLM to solve. Trust means different things in different contexts. You trust a friend because they understand your worldview and they have your best interest in mind. Does an LLM do this? You trust a business because they have consistently delivered valuable services to their customers, leveraging proprietary, up-to-date knowledge acquired through their operations, which rely on having the latest and most accurate information as a competitive advantage. Descartes stores this mornings garbage truck routes for Boise IA in its route planning software - thats the only source I trust for Boise IA garbage truck routes. This, I believe is the purpose for tools, agents and function calling in LLMs, and APIs from Descartes. But this trust needs to be signaled to the user in the LLM response. Some measure of the original intent against the quality of the response needs to be given back to the user so that its not just an illusion of the facts and knowledge, but a verified response that the user can critically evaluate as to whether it matches their intent. reply ljm 7 hours agorootparentprevI believe it’s going to become counter productive sooner than anyone might think, and in fairly frustrating ways. I can see a class of programmers trading their affinity with the skill for a structurally unstable crutch.

It turns out they were all completely fabricated (easy to tell because I had the docs open and none of the functions it referred to existed), and when asked to clarify it just replied “yeah this is just how I imagine it would work.” reply FooBarWidget 6 hours agorootparentOne technique to reduce hallucinations is to tell the LLM \"don't make things up, if you don't know then say so\". Make a habit of saying this for important questions or questions for which you suspect the LLM may not know. reply ljm 2 hours agorootparentIt's hit and miss, for the same reason Google is (and increasingly more so). If you try and search for 'langchaingo' then you might get lucky if you add enough into the query to say you're working with go, but otherwise it'd just see 'langchain'. Google is pretty much useless for the same reason. They're not actually more intelligent, they're more stupid, so you have to provide more and more context to get desired results compared to them just doing more exact searching. Ultimately they just want you to boost their metrics with more searches and by loading more ads with tracking, so intelligently widening results to do that is in their favour. reply victorbjorklund 8 hours agorootparentprevyea, I seen it alot on social media where people use ChatGPT as a source for things it possible cant know.

I could have spent the next 30 minutes prompt engineering and manually verifying results, but instead I asked it to write a script to compare two LLMs, which turned out fine.

To the LLM the two are the same level of complexity, so performing less work means less possibility of error. Also, the LLM is more likely to fail spectacularly by hallucinating APIs when writing a script, and more likely to fail subtly on parsing tasks. reply dbaupp 9 hours agorootparentIn addition to what you say, it can also be easier for a (appropriately-skilled) human to verify a small program than to verify voluminous parsing output, plus, as you say, there's the semi-automated \"verification\" of a very-wrong program failing to execute. reply jessekv 8 hours agorootparentprevAll tests have this problem.

I just started college for the first time and had a list of due dates for assignments. I asked chatGPT \"Can you make me an ics file from this list of dates\" It did it instantly and told me to save the file in a text editor as an .ics file. But it messed up and put the assignments and discuissions on the same week. I ask \"Do the same thing but move the discussion questions to the following tuesday, and put the assignment details in the details of the meeting. It spit out a perfect .ics file. reply CraigJPerry 2 hours agoprevWhen I long press on any date in the grainy image listing the dates, iOS OCRs the text, interprets it as a date and because I long-pressed, it offers a popup context menu to create an appointment or a reminder, while showing a day view of my calendar for that date. reply bmarswalker 2 hours agoprevI tried this in ChatGPT 3.5 times and it repeatedly said \"I am a language model and can't do that\".

Pleasantly surprised on both counts. Example hallucinations from ChatGPT include researching the dates of historical events for the company I work at, trivially verifiable by me but I was being lazy... ChatGPT told me about blog posts that never existed and I could prove never existed, Claude was spot on with dates and source links (but only appeared to have data through to the end of last year). On coding, CoPilot came up with reasonable suggestions but Claude was able to take a file as an input and match the style of the code within the repo. Claude, for me, is starting to hint at what a highly productive assistant can achieve. reply romeros 12 hours agoparentFor some reason I felt Claude was Yahoo to ChatGPT's Google in the initial days. It just felt like ChatGPT had an insurmountable moat. I played with Claude and it is just insanely superior compared to ChatGpt as of now.

But, Claude is just superior to Chatgpt. reply wenc 11 hours agorootparentI pay for both Claude and ChatGPT. Claude 3.5 is now my daily driver but it still refuses to answer certain questions especially about geopolitics so I still have to go back to ChatGPT.

It was unable to create the .ics directly at first, but at least it wrote the python script that created the .ics. I first ask the LLM to write out the calendar events in a markdown table to double-check it read everything correctly, and then create the file. A different prompting strategy later on, ai think with example .ics formatting, resulted in a correct .ics. I just had to *emphasize* the time zone. reply pietz 12 hours agoprevReally cool!

I use a combination of the Reminders and Calendar apps to mark entries of academic conferences I participate. One interesting thing for me personally would be to find a way to read the appointments in the Reminders app (presumably a sqlite3 db somewhere in iCloud) and create corresponding dates in the calendar, such that whenever I add a reminder to submit papers to a conference, this would automagically block that calendar slot for the dates of the conference such that I know not to schedule in person meetings with anyone in those dates. reply fmbb 7 hours agoprevMaybe useful in some cases, but this calendar has a heading saying the lessons are \"every other week\" so you don't have to make 13 calendar entries.

    "originBody": "Science Study: Air purifier use at daycare centres cut kids' sick days by a third The results of the study at two Helsinki daycare centres are still preliminary but promising, a researcher says. Open image viewer The air purifiers used in the experiment differed in size as well as manufacturer. Image: Mårten Lampén / Yle YLE NEWS 27.11.2023 17:33 • Updated 28.11.2023 7:57 Use of air purifiers at two daycare centres in Helsinki led to a reduction in illnesses and absences among children and staff, according to preliminary findings of a new study led by E3 Pandemic Response. Air purifiers of various sizes and types were placed in two of the city's daycare centres during cold and flu seasons. The initial results from the first year of research are promising, according to researcher Enni Sanmark, from HUS Helsinki University Hospital. \"Children were clearly less sick in daycare centres where air purification devices were used — down by around 30 percent,\" Sanmark explained. The air purifiers were changed at two daycare centres serving as a control in the experiment, in order to rule out the effect that possible epidemic fluctuations could have on the results. The study's next phase will continue until April. \"We will be able to analyse whether there were only decreases in flu-type illnesses or whether the use of air purification could also help reduce stomach ailments,\" Sanmark said. On average, daycare centre-aged children suffer 10-13 infectious illnesses every year, with each illness lasting from one to three weeks, according to the research. Open image viewer Researcher Enni Sanmark from HUS Helsinki University Hospital. Image: Mårten Lampén / Yle Meanwhile, kids between the ages of 1-3 come down with flu-like symptoms between five to eight times a year — and children also often suffer stomach bugs, on top of that. Kids are particularly prone to catching colds after returning to daycare after their summer break. Those illnesses are often shared by the kids' parents and daycare staff, prompting absences from work. Sanmark said that employers face costs of around 370 euros for one day of an employee's sick leave. \"It would be a big savings if we could get rid of 30 percent of sick days spread by children, as well as the illnesses that go home to parents,\" Sanmark said. The research aims to help build an air purification scheme that could be used at other daycare centres — namely how to get the air cleaner at such facilities in ways that aren't too noisy, expensive or take up too much space. The final results of the study are expected next spring. \"At the moment, we are cautiously positive. Daycares and schools [here] have not done this before, but of course results from around the world show that air purification can reduce pathogens in the air, so our results are in line with these findings. We're excited and will continue our research,\" Sanmark said. Prompted by the Covid-19 crisis, the E3 Pandemic Response project is a private and public effort that aims to \"harness modern science and technology to create effective countermeasures to prevent the spreading of novel infectious diseases\".

The high pH of exhaled droplets containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus is likely a major driver of the loss of infectiousness. CO2 behaves as an acid when it interacts with droplets. This causes the pH of the droplets to become less alkaline, resulting in the virus within them being inactivated at a slower rate. https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cabot/news/2024/virus.html Ambient carbon dioxide concentration correlates with SARS-CoV-2 aerostability and infection risk https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47777-5 reply lolinder 17 minutes agorootparentThanks!

For a fuller explanation of how immunologists think about this today, see this article: https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-08-13-crowds-vs-friends/ In short - viruses can actually harm your immune system and lead to long term problems. OTOH, we co-evolved with certain parasites that can help us. Airborne pathogens are not likely to be the helpful type we’ve co-evolved with — they’re much more likely to be the type we’ve only had to deal with since the creation of higher density living and rapid long distance travel. Therefore air filters are likely to help children’s health both short and long term. reply dennis_jeeves2 45 minutes agorootparentTo sort of complement what you are saying, the 'hygiene hypothesis' also ends up being a an excuse for not looking at other factors. (very similar to blaming genes alone for health issues) reply Terr_ 2 hours agorootparentprevWhat you've written is unproven, and I see two facets of confusion: First, there's a huge difference between \"strong\" immune responses and \"good\" immune responses. Triggering the adaptive immune system is dangerous, like unleashing Skynet robots against a zombie apocalypse. You don't nuke a city at the first police report of one person biting another. Your body has a ton of cascading safety interlocks to try to avoid triggering more than is absolutely necessary. Second, there's a difference between \"we need dangerous exposure to actual pathogens\" versus \"we need calibration against a mileu of benign species we co-evolved with.\" There's no evidence our immune systems are somehow \"weaker\" than our ancestors', but they do seem to be miscalibrated and trigger-happy. reply sitkack 1 hour agorootparentThere are immune system benefits to vaginal delivery which is primarily about the the transfer microbiota from the mother to the child.

If parents only get a choice as to when, I think nearly all would choose for them to be exposed younger and before the critical high school/college years, when the stakes are much higher. reply cogman10 1 hour agorootparentWhen a disease is dangerous depends a lot on the specific disease. Measles for an adult is mostly a non-issue. Measles for a child carries a high risk of deafness and blindness. Chickenpox for an infant can be deadly, for a child is normal, and for an adult man can cause sterility. There's no blanket \"best time\" to get sick with an infectious disease. And some diseases, like chickenpox, later surface as painful shingles (which in the worst case can result in permanent nerve damage). The best thing to do is vaccination. It's safe for the vast majority of the population and sidesteps complications completely.

You can still be exposed, but you don't need to let the concentrations of pathogens to build up in stale air over the course of a school day. The results aren't in yet, and of course will be subject to reproduction/duplicatation, but I suspect that's what we're seeing here. People (children) are still getting sick, just less so, presumably because they're getting exposed to lower concentrations of pathogens. The article doesn't make it clear (or I missed it) if the reduction is in severity (time spent recovering from being sick), frequency (number of times one gets sick), or a combination thereof. If I'm right, I'd expect it to be a reduction stemming from both reduced frequency/severity. reply maxerickson 2 hours agorootparentprevThe other poster made a statement about the strength of the immune system. I don't think there's much evidence that exposure to virus A ends up contributing to a robust response to virus Z. There's some benefit if the infections are somewhat related, but not if they are dissimilar. So sure, exposure to a particular infection is likely to make your immune system more responsive to that infection, but it's probably not reasonable to say that it has gotten stronger. And then, measles in particular can actually damage existing immunity to other infections, making exposure to it quite a lot more dangerous than just the immediate infection. https://asm.org/articles/2019/may/measles-and-immune-amnesia reply dv_dt 1 hour agorootparentprevThere is a lot of evidence that exposure to Covid induces long term permanent damage to tissue and the ability of the immune system to fight off other infections. reply thebruce87m 2 hours agorootparentprevMaybe there is still exposure, but at a lower viral load? reply api 2 hours agorootparentprevIn the extreme there is evidence that no exposure to pathogens might weaken immunity, but that is not going to be a problem unless someone is living in a bubble or on a space station. reply noxer 2 hours agorootparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] Kirby64 2 hours agorootparentIn your hypothetical of it only costing a few dollars a year the economic savings just by not having children be sick even once would easily outweigh any downsides.

Vaccines teach your immune system to fight specific viruses. reply jacoblambda 1 hour agorootparentprevSo this is an extremely simplified answer but essentially some pathogen gets into the body. If they find a cell first, they generally get to do their job and try to kill the cell and replicate. But if a macrophage (a type of white blood cell) finds them first betfore they've intruded upon a cell, the macrophage eats it and disassembles it into little tiny pieces. The macrophage then hands over some of the important pieces to undifferentiated T cells. Those T cells then \"differentiate\" into one of two forms. The first are \"Helper T cells\" which carry the \"design\" for antibodies (immunoglobulins, i.e. proteins that bind to pathogens directly. These then share those antibody designs with B-Cells. The other type are \"Killer T cells\" which carry the \"design\" for T-cell-receptors that can detect \"sick\" cells for this specific pathogen or defect. They go hunt after the specific cell and essentially cause them to explode with the power of hydrogen peroxide. Then the macrophages eat up the dead infected cell and all the pathogens inside it and start the process anew. Now those B-Cells get the \"design\" for antibodies from the helper T cells and differentiate into two types. The first is essentially a factory that mass produces the antibodies and dumps them into the body. Those antibody proteins then bind to the pathogens and the macrophages can then directly attack the pathogens (because they have a bunch of big flags/alarms on them). The other type of B-Cell that they can differentiate into are memory B-cells. These keep the designs stored inside them and keep detectors for the pathogen on their cell membrane. Then they \"go to sleep\" until their detectors are activated by the pathogen. They live out their lives and replicate as needed to continue their lineage. When a pathogen shows up, they bind to either the pathogen directly or to some of the proteins it produces and they turn their factories on at full speed and start mass producing antibodies to start the immune response as fast as possible locally before the pathogen can do damage. They get depleted in this effort of course but if things go okay, the following immune response should trigger the creation of more memory B cells. (and when they don't you get stuff like immune amnesia). There are also \"memory T-cells\" but how they come about and how exactly they work is fuzzy and not super well understood. It's similar to memory B-cells but it's way more complicated and a bit \"magic\". But yeah eventually then your body beats the infection and things go back to normal with the memory cells hanging out in the body. Now the important thing with intensity of infection is that a mild infection will generally guarantee your body learns a sane, moderate response but a major infection can send your body into a panic and put the immune system into overdrive. That can train a response that attacks the pathogen but also attacks a lot of other stuff in the process (auto-immune response). You can think of this kind of like an analog version of machine learning on proteins (the training input). A bad fit can end up mischaracterizing healthy cells and bodily structures as \"pathogens\" and cause long term issues or even just severe reactions when you get a reinfection. Now for getting \"trained\" from the parent, this happens during pregnancy by diffusion of a subset of the antibodies from the mother to the fetus (not all types can but many do).

It's currently refreshing the air at around 100m³/hour. It has an F7 (aka \"ISO Fine\" or \"MERV 13\") filter. Since installing it, my asthma has improved a fair bit, and I'm sneezing a lot less. Added benefit, virtually no mosquitoes have been able to enter my home. I'm still considering getting an extra filter addon to filter out more fine soot from car exhaust etc, but even without that option I've been very happy with the results. Edit: hit reply too soon.

One of the biggest takeaways seemed to be that UV light destroys viruses in seconds. Seems like there a lot of things we could do reply plasticchris 2 hours agoparentYeah, even a single UV bulb in the cold air return might be effective. This is well known in hiking circles where UV is used to sanitize water. I might hook one up now that I have the idea. reply schiffern 50 minutes agorootparentI looked into implementing this once. Some surprising things I learned: 1. You need UV-C (typically 222 nm), not just any old UV bulb off Alibaba/Wish/Amazon. 2. You need an extremely high UV light intensity to kill viruses if the air is just flowing past the bulb (vs shining UV on a coil to prevent bacterial/fungal growth, which is the typical usage), and you need more intensity the faster the air is flowing. Usually this requires multiple bulbs. 3. You need to replace your UV-C bulbs every 1,000 hours or so, because they rapidly lose intensity with operating time. Just putting a \"black light poster\" bulb in your ducts won't accomplish anything, other than perhaps giving you a false sense of security. reply bri3d 1 minute agorootparent> You need to replace your UV-C bulbs every 1,000 hours or so I don't think this should need to be the case. Low pressure mercury arc lamps (253.7nm) last 10,000 hours in water treatment applications - a much more palatable replacement timeline (1 year) vs every few weeks! reply amluto 1 hour agorootparentprevIf you have an appropriately sized filter holder, I would just install a MERV 13 or 16 filter. They’re very cost effective, widely available, and they will remove non-living crud, too. The main problem is that many central air systems use crappy thin filter holders. A good low-resistance filter needs a lot of area, and a 4” or 5” thick format works well, 2” is marginal, and 1” sucks. A good filter holder costs under $200, takes very little effort to install in a new system, and is an incredible pain to retrofit into an existing system. And good filters are essentially unsupported in ductless systems. reply elric 1 hour agorootparentprevHmm, I wonder how effective that would be. My small home's ventilation system is currently taking in about 100m³ of fresh air per hour. That's about 1600L/minute. Let's assume the intake duct is about 20cm in diameter, and assume we can place a bulb to illuminate a 50cm stretch of pipe. That's a volume of about 16 liters. So the air would be in visible range of the bulb for about half a second. Would that be enough for a UV bulb to do anything? This was back of napkin maths, could be way off.

The prototype plant was shut down after a short time due to poor reliability. In 1955, UV water treatment systems were applied in Austria and Switzerland; by 1985 about 1,500 plants were employed in Europe. In 1998 it was discovered that protozoa such as cryptosporidium and giardia were more vulnerable to UV light than previously thought; this opened the way to wide-scale use of UV water treatment in North America. By 2001, over 6,000 UV water treatment plants were operating in Europe And yes, there are also commercial products for home use. reply mauvehaus 1 hour agorootparentprevYou can, but it does not leave any residual ability for the water to neutralize pathogens once you're done treating the water. If you dip a Nalgene bottle to fill it, then purify the contents, you would typically then bleed the threads by holding the bottle upside down and loosening the cap. With chemical treatment, the iodine in the water works to neutralize any pathogens that aren't flushed out of the threads. If you've used UV, you're kind of hoping that the flushing action has physically washed out anything lingering in the threads. Anecdotally, people using UV get more cases of waterborne illness, but I don't know if anyone has rigorously studied this. Hikers are naturally resistant to controlled experiments. If you don't like the flavor of iodine tablets, I recommend AquaMira instead. Source: AT ME-MA 2003, GA-ME 2010. UV was pretty popular by 2010 and for a couple years after.

I can hold it 2 inches from any of my filters and the alarm sounds. 640 CPM alpha radiation. That changed my project priorities. The filters only bought me some time as the air away from the filters is the same level of radiation as outdoor background noise but obviously the source is still emitting gas.

And they’re cheap. reply LinuxBender 2 hours agorootparentYou're right but it won't help in my case. I created an ad-hoc system that does the same thing but the source is not at ground level. Through some form of convection I suspect around the chimney the gas is being pushed into the attic and then coming down in rooms they did not join the wall to the ceiling correctly. Most of the radioactive dust is being produced in the attic which nobody has touched for 60+ years. If I put the geiger counter in the attic it goes nuts.

I don’t know where you are but in the USA you could reach out to a university extension program/office and ask them to look into it. It’s bizarre enough to catch their interest and come at no cost to you. Edit: it really is bizarre because Radon is primarily produced by reactions underground/in the earth and has a relatively short half life (3.5 days). I don’t see how it could be atmospherically sourced without it being a hazard to the whole community, regardless of the bizarre convection currents that bring it into your house. It’s unlikely to be produced in your attic. If I were you, I’d want to know more and understand how this is all happening lest you raze and rebuild and find you still have a problem. reply rini17 2 hours agorootparentRadon decays into other longer lived radioactive elements, mostly isotopes of lead, which then condense down as dust and cause more problems than radon itself.

Radon does indeed have extremely nasty decay products, but they are very short lived (which is why they’re so nasty). They’re not accumulating in your attic.

We actually planned for it. By planning for no activities. Just bunkering and resting for 2 months straight. We began partial daycare on Thursdays + Fridays in winter.

On Saturday he's sick, and you hope for a good lottery. Diarrhea? Puking? Maybe not. But a runny nose most probably. These may ruin your nights, still. Sunday they are sick, and you begin to feel unwell. Monday the kids is recovering, but you're still in it. By Wednesday you should be good though. And then it's Thursday again.

Do you talk to individuals who are directly responsible for teaching those folks the language? reply maeil 38 minutes agorootparentI think it was clear from my comment that I haven't heard a single person (not just study) here talk about it. While it's reasonable such an adverse effect would be stronger in cases where at home a different language is spoken than the national language, it's very unlikely that it would only have a noticeable effect for exactly those families, with zero noticeable effect otherwise. And here, where masking rates were extremely high and amount of attention put on/money spent on child development is higher than almost anywhere else in the world, no one has ever brought it up. This doesn't even touch upon the fact that unprivileged families are much harder hit by epidemics (let alone Covid) in general, due to a host of other factors. > But of course if the facts go against the government narrative, the “studies” will not report them.

You also have to consider external air quality, as ventilating a building with polluted air would have negative effects like increased asthma. In that case perhaps a sealed building with air purifiers is a better option, but then CO2 buildup is a concern, so you'd need CO2 scrubbers, which are expensive.

For anyone who doesn't have an idea why something like this matters or is inspiring beyond art, legged vehicles have many downsides but one big upside is that you can theoretically avoid the rubber/microplastic particulate emission associated with tires and wheeled vehicles if you can make legged vehicles as good as wheeled ones. Even an electric battery vehicle with an electric motor charged by a solar/wind/nuclear power plant still emits pure poison into the air and waterways through friction between tires and the road. Good alternatives would be biocompatible tires (Nitinol mesh tires like SMART Tire company's initial prototype that lacked the rubber coating) or legged vehicles. reply jpk 10 minutes agoparent> legged vehicles have many downsides but one big upside is that you can theoretically avoid the rubber/microplastic particulate emission associated with tires and wheeled vehicles if you can make legged vehicles as good as wheeled ones. How do you square this idea with the fact that my running shoes wear out? I'm a legged vehicle, and it's clear that the soles of my shoes wear down over time and the lost mass of the rubber went somewhere. Whether legs or wheels, there are going to be contact patches that have to endure some quantity of sheering force when the vehicle is doing anything other than remaining stationary. It's this sheering force that grates the particulates away from tires, and I presume a legged vehicle would need a tire-like compound on the surfaces it uses to contact the road. So why would legs be different in this regard? reply polishdude20 3 hours agoparentprevWouldn't a legged vehicle still have that problem if it can achieve the same speeds and weights that regular cars go at? Scale up a human for example to the weight and speed of a car. Crazy powerful and big legs, big feet, big shoes. The rubber must hit the road either way and push down with a force to propel the weight of this car-heavy legged human at speeds of 100km/h. It would still wear rubber away just like tires do. Legged vehicles aren't a replacement for regular vehicles if tire particulates are your concern. reply user_7832 1 hour agorootparent> It would still wear rubber away just like tires do. It’s been a hot minute since I learnt rolling friction in high school physics but (iirc) a very interesting and unintuitive aspect of it is that there’s always an opposing/slowing force on a (rubber) wheel. Only a slippping wheel will not experience a slowdown. Static friction is different from rolling friction, and (I think) can offer zero wear in ideal conditions - but rolling wear is always non-zero. reply necovek 3 hours agorootparentprevCouldn't you do away with rubber and shoes since for legs you don't need flat, smooth roads either (so metal legs of a multi-ton vehicle won't have anything to damage too bad).

Sure they're cool-looking untethered kites but all the nonsense about \"creating new forms of life\" - really? reply RodgerTheGreat 4 hours agoparentIt's partially euphemism, but there's also more substance to it than you may realize. The ratios in the Jansen linkages were originally developed through genetic algorithms in computer simulations. Jansen now builds multiple generations of machines at once and has them compete in various \"survival\" tasks on the beaches, prioritizing further development based on the success of each \"mutation\"; an ongoing human-assisted evolutionary process. The Strandbeest machines are also capable of much more sophisticated behavior than may be evident: they pressurize air using wind power and store it in bottles, which in turn run pneumatic \"nervous systems\" made from logic gates, oscillators, and flip-flops. As the machines have grown more sophisticated they've gained the ability to sense the waterline (with ground-trailing hoses that detect back-pressure from water) and avoid it, to anchor themselves to the ground when it gets too windy, to steer around simple obstacles, and so on. Strandbeest machines reproducing independently from humans would be a pipe-dream, but at the very least they should be understood as autonomous, biomimetic robots at the same time as they are sculptures. reply iterateoften 4 hours agorootparentI don’t care either way about this conversation, just thought it was interesting, but what you described is essentially every engineered thing.

Yet, of course, that's exactly how we encounter LLMs! The whole _point_ of ChatGPT isn't to do a \"mechanical learning\" (whatever that might be,) it's to create an experience that is more reminiscent of talking to another human being.

    "originBody": "Facebook Banned Me for Life Because I Help People Use It Less BY LOUIS BARCLAY OCT 07, 20219:38 AM Timothy Hales Bennett/Unsplash TWEET SHARE COMMENT If someone built a tool that made Facebook less addictive—a tool that allowed users to benefit from Facebook’s positive features while limiting their exposure to its negative ones—how would Facebook respond? I know the answer, because I built the tool, and Facebook squashed it. This summer, Facebook sent me a cease-and-desist letter threatening legal action. It permanently disabled my Facebook and Instagram accounts. And it demanded that I agree to never again create tools that interact with Facebook or its other services. The tool I created, a browser extension called Unfollow Everything, allowed users to delete their News Feed by unfollowing their friends, groups, and pages. The News Feed, as users of Facebook know, is that never-ending page that greets you when you log in. It’s the central hub of Facebook. It’s also a major source of revenue. As a Facebook whistleblower observed on 60 Minutes on Sunday, time spent on the platform translates to ads viewed and clicked on, which in turn translates to billions of dollars for Facebook. The News Feed is the thing that keeps people glued to the platform for hours on end, often on a daily basis; without it, time spent on the network would drop considerably. I had the idea for Unfollow Everything a few years ago, when I realized you don’t actually need to have a News Feed. If you unfollow everything—all of your friends, groups, and pages—your News Feed ends up empty. This isn’t the same as unfriending. If you unfollow your friends and groups, you’re still connected to them, and you can look up their profiles if you want. But by unfollowing everything, you eliminate your News Feed. This leaves you free to use Facebook without the feed, or to more actively curate it by refollowing only those friends and groups whose posts you really want to see. I still remember the feeling of unfollowing everything for the first time. It was near-miraculous. I had lost nothing, since I could still see my favorite friends and groups by going to them directly. But I had gained a staggering amount of control. I was no longer tempted to scroll down an infinite feed of content. The time I spent on Facebook decreased dramatically. Overnight, my Facebook addiction became manageable. ADVERTISEMENT When I unfollowed everything for the first time, I did it manually. I spent hours using a Facebook-provided feature to click unfollow on each of my friends, groups, and pages. I quickly realized that very few people would go to the same trouble, so I coded a simple tool that would automate the process. In July 2020, I published it to the Chrome Store, where people could download it for free. Unfollow Everything started taking off. People loved it. Thousands of people got rid of their News Feed using it. Reviews included comments like “I am officially not addicted to Facebook thanks to you!” I received emails from people telling me that using the tool had changed their lives. A few months after I published Unfollow Everything, academics at the University of Neuchâtel, in Switzerland, expressed interest in using it to study the News Feed’s impact on the amount of time spent on Facebook and the happiness of the platform’s users. We began working together. The university recruited people to join two study groups: one where participants deleted their News Feeds using Unfollow Everything and a control group where participants left their feeds intact. Participants agreed to share limited and anonymous information—specifically, the amount of time they spent on Facebook, the number of times they visited the site, and the number of friends, groups, and pages they were following and not following, both in total and broken down by category. (For regular Unfollow Everything users, the only Facebook-related data shared was the ratio of followed profiles to total profiles, a metric that helped me ensure the tool was working.) ADVERTISEMENT Then, a few months ago, Facebook sent me a cease-and-desist letter. The company demanded that I take down the tool. It also told me that it had permanently disabled my Facebook account—an account that I’d had for more than 15 years, and that was my primary way of staying in touch with family and friends around the world. Pointing to a provision in its terms of service that purports to bind even former users of Facebook, Facebook also demanded that I never again create a tool that interacts with Facebook or its many other services in any way. These demands seemed outrageous to me. They also seemed outrageous to lawyers I consulted from the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, and in the U.K. But my options were limited. I’m a U.K. resident, so a lawsuit against Facebook would probably have played out in a U.K. court, where I would have been personally on the hook for Facebook’s litigation costs if I lost. Facebook is a trillion-dollar company. I couldn’t afford that risk, so Unfollow Everything no longer exists. This is bad for its users, and also for the University of Neuchâtel, which will no longer be able to use it to study the News Feed. ADVERTISEMENT I am far from the only one to face this kind of scenario. Facebook is increasingly using its terms of service to crush not only research, but also tools that give users more control over their data and platform experience. Just last summer, Facebook went after Friendly, a web browser that allows users to switch between their social media accounts, more easily download or repost photos and videos, and filter their feeds by keyword.

TikTok Conspiracy Theorists Are Convinced That Mpox Will Lead to a “Second Lockdown” Getting an IUD Inserted Is Tricky. Getting an IUD Out Can Be a Different Story. In the Past I Would Have Laughed at Obama’s Penis Joke. But Not Now. Facebook’s behavior isn’t just anti-competitive; it’s anti-consumer. We are being locked into platforms by virtue of their undeniable usefulness, and then prevented from making legitimate choices over how we use them—not just through the squashing of tools like Unfollow Everything, but through the highly manipulative designs and features platforms adopt in the first place. The loser here is the user, and the cost is counted in billions of wasted hours spent on Facebook. If lawmakers and regulators are serious about empowering users to stand up to big tech, they need to address the ways in which platforms stymie user choice, including through terms of service. Platforms shouldn’t be able to wield the threat of lawsuits and account suspensions against researchers and developers who create tools that merely empower users—but as my experience shows, they can and do. How many people will be put off making tools that serve the public as a result? I’m still searching for other ways to help people use Facebook less. But in the meantime, at least I can thank it for something: My own Facebook addiction is now definitively under control.

I'm also convinced that clicking \"not interested\" doesn't do anything because every time I click it, I can just refresh the tab and see the exact same tweet all over again. reply Sylamore 7 minutes agorootparentLikewise I am convinced the \"not interested\" option does nothing, now I just straight block those pages/people when it shows up - the algorithm will send me another of nearly the same content but I keep blocking them and now a lot of that content is gone from my timeline, but FB is really convinced I want to see non-stop steam/model train and WWII content. reply PaulHoule 40 minutes agorootparentprevA “dislike button” that really worked on social media would overturn their business completely. reply mrinfinitiesx 1 hour agorootparentprevI removed the finger-printing from my browser with degoogle: https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle - Alternatives to google/other big platforms.

After deleting about 100 pages from my list of followed pages, I notice the last 10 would re-appear. Every 50 or so pages I'd delete from my list -- which to begin with is a purposefully slow and painful UX whether done manually or javascriptically -- 5 or more pages would reappear. It took a while to realize what was happening because it wasn't always 5 or 10, sometimes it was 2 or 4 and the time between occurrences was sometimes so long that I originally assumed I just missed some. Then I noticed some pages got re-listed after a day or so. This got me pretty upset but it was only the beginning. I began making it a daily mission to delete at least 50 pages a day and keep deleting them as often as they came back. It was at this point when pages stopped reappearing and I'd get an alert from the app that went something like \"Hey (stop sign emoji) stop! You shouldn't be doing that!\" and a bunch of lines about how I'm using the app in a way that's not meant to be, and some vague noise about continuing in such a way may lead to repercussions to functionality and/or my account. What? I'm not supposed to use the delete button on the Pages Followed (or whatever) pop out list? After ignoring these warnings and deleting as much as I could, one day I found the delete functionality would just stop working after deleting 20 or so pages, if at all. My frustration led to me pausing my account for a month or so, then reactivating when I felt motivated to delete more pages until again the functionality would either be limited or completely impossible. Finally I paused my account for 4 years until 2016 when I found I got delete all followed Pages. I was so happy about this I started using FB daily again but not nearly as much as I used to. Funnily enough the same thing happened to me in 2021 on Instagram when I tried to unfollow accounts. That said I've always thought FB had/has the potential to be a public utility as a local-first product. Like, families should have an FB. Your street or the floor of your building should have a FB. Neighborhoods should have a FB.It doesn't even necessarily need to be ad-free, just community oriented. I suppose that's Mastadon's intention but FB does it best IMHO reply wishfish 3 minutes agoprevWish I could remember the setting I changed. My personal page has only friends + groups I followed. I know I set it up to stop randoms but can't remember how. I also run a page for a local volunteer org. When I'm signed in as that page, I get the flood of random crap. Not sure why there's such a difference between my feed and this page's feed. reply zahlman 1 hour agoprev> These demands seemed outrageous to me. They also seemed outrageous to lawyers I consulted from the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, and in the U.K. But my options were limited. I’m a U.K. resident, so a lawsuit against Facebook would probably have played out in a U.K. court, where I would have been personally on the hook for Facebook’s litigation costs if I lost. Facebook is a trillion-dollar company. Seems like this could have been answered by releasing the source code? Someone else could remake and distribute the app; and if Facebook didn't like that, they'd have to be the ones to file a lawsuit. reply MichaelZuo 1 hour agoparentThe author is exaggerating the risk, even if Facebook goes all the way, via hiring the most expensive gold plated Magic circle teams, and wins, the judge wouldn’t assign 100% of the inflated costs to the author. Of course they could still be on the hook for normal costs relative to the actual workload imposed (i.e. what the median law firm would charge), but that’s a potential consequence for any lawsuit whatsoever in the UK.

Tell me you’ve never read the Terms and Conditions without telling me. You don’t have a legal right to anything on Facebooks servers.

This can include information collected by social media sites. Just because Facebook has a forced arbitration agreement in their TOS doesn't mean it's valid everywhere, especially in countries that nullify those clauses. The same goes with information collection clauses. Laws supercede terms of services. And personally, while I don't mind users being able to be banned for harassing users, I do think everyone, including trolls, should have the right to information collected about them and their account reply jpc0 27 minutes agorootparentprev> and my introvert nature makes phonecalls very uncomfortable It's got nothing to do with introversion, you aren't comfortable makeing phonecalls.

Mental health issues aren't something to be ashamed of, it is affecting your quality of life and should be diagnosed and treated by a professional. I'm not saying you have a mental health issue. I'm just saying if you do, you don't need to let it effect your life. reply MisterBastahrd 49 minutes agorootparentprevThe actual reality is that you worked yourself into the untenable position of being so hands-off with people that you need a social network to do what a phone can do just as well, and that's because most of the people in everyone's social network are not actually people that we care to stay in touch with on a daily or even monthly basis. You don't need a social network. You choose to use one. There are people in my facebook feed who I haven't seen in person in over 20 years. It's nice to keep up with them and their lives and families, but if I lost access to facebook tomorrow, it wouldn't change a thing for me. I am friendly with these people but I don't actually know them anymore and am not all that invested in their lives. reply ryandrake 12 minutes agorootparentIt is totally possible to have a robust social life and keep up with friends and family without Social Media. OP just needs to put in effort and not hide behind all those excuses. I burned my Facebook account at least 10 years ago, maybe 15... I can’t remember when, it’s been so long.

    "originLink": "https://spwhitton.name/tech/code/papersway/",
    "originBody": "spwhitton/ tech/ code/ papersway Edit RecentChanges History Preferences Description This is an implementation of PaperWM-like scrollable window management for Sway/i3wm. If you like Sway/i3wm’s commitments to stability, avoiding scope creep etc. but dislike the window management model, papersway might be of interest. On each workspace, windows are arranged in a row. By default, two of the windows in the row are visible at a time, and you can move left and right in the row to display other windows. Opening a new window pushes one of the visible windows off the screen to make room, and closing a window pulls in a window to fill the space. You can reorder the windows. There is a display of the row of workspaces in the bar, e.g. ‡ ‡ ‡ ‡ . Here, the focused workspace has four windows, and the middle two are the ones currently visible. If the third window has focus and we open another window, then the second window will be pushed off to make room, and we will get ‡ ‡ ‡ ‡ ‡ . The third window remains visible, but moves to the left side of the display. There are commands to change the number of visible windows; toggle monocle mode, in which the focused window occupies all visible columns; and jump to a fresh workspace, which means a new, empty workspace occurring immediately after the currently focused workspace. E.g. if you have two workspaces, 1 2 and you request a fresh workspace, the second workspace will be renamed out of the way, leaving you with 1 2 3 and no windows visible. Video demo Installation You can install papersway and its dependencies from CPAN. E.g. with cpanminus (available in distro repositories), % cpanm App::papersway and then add $HOME/perl5/bin to your PATH environment variable. On Debian 13 or later & Ubuntu 24.10 or later, apt-get install papersway. Usage Usage instructions, including sample key bindings, are maintained in papersway(1).

This is especially useful if you're using a widescreen monitor. I never understood the appeal of tiling as 99% of the time I am focused on a single window at a time and I want it to take the full height of my display, so scrolling with the focused window centered is my ideal workflow. I only wish I had the ability to quickly toggle the side-by-side mode that is default with these for the occasional time I need to have a code editor next to my browser. If anyone knows if any of these supports that toggle, while also supporting the other key features I use in karousel (being able to shrink/expand the focused window with a hotkey), then I'd be willing to leave KDE to get that perfect workflow. reply linsomniac 4 hours agorootparent>I never understood the appeal of tiling I like physical positional cues, and being able to just flick my eyes over to other things to check status rather than having to scroll through hidden context. I have a terrible habit of losing my train of thought if I check on something that's hidden, and thereby hide my current work. So just being able to glance and then glance back is a huge plus. I also have an insane amount of screen real estate on my work machine (2x 4K 30\" displays, 1x 2K 15\"), so I can have everything on screen at once. I mostly use terminals, a couple browsers, and slack, so YMMV if you are using a bunch of IDE-like windows or the like. reply celrod 7 hours agorootparentprevDo you not often quickly look between files? If so, odds are you're using tiles within tmux, vim, emacs, vscode, or something. I use kakoune, which has a client/server architecture. Each kak instance I open within a project connects to the same server, so it is natural for me to use my WM (niri) to tile my terminals, instead of having something like tmux or the editor do the tiling for me. I don't want to bother with more than one layer of WM, where separate layers don't mix. reply OJFord 5 hours agorootparentprev> I never understood the appeal of tiling as 99% of the time I am focused on a single window at a time and I want it to take the full height of my display Even if everything is full screen, it enforces that I don't have something else hidden behind, gives me the ability to snap immediately between them (programs/workspaces) with a keyboard shortcut. I mostly only have 1 full screen program per workspace (sway on Linux, yabai on macOS) but find that invaluable, really struggle to use say my wife's laptop with an overlapping mess of windows, where the best I can is tab between them.

    "title": "Postgres as a Search Engine",
    "originLink": "https://anyblockers.com/posts/postgres-as-a-search-engine",
    "originBody": "Last Monday • 15 minute read Postgres as a search engine Build a retrieval system with semantic, full-text, and fuzzy search in Postgres to be used as a backbone in RAG pipelines. Search is hard. It’s a critical part of many apps, but getting it right isn’t easy. This is especially true for RAG-pipelines where the quality of retrieval can make or break the entire process. While semantic search is trendy, good old lexical search is still the backbone. Semantic techniques can improve results, but they work best when added to a solid text-based search foundation. In this post, we’ll explore how to use Postgres to create a robust search engine. We’ll combine three techniques: Full-text search with tsvector Semantic search with pgvector Fuzzy matching with pg_trgm Bonus: BM25 This approach might not be the absolute best for every situation, but it’s a great alternative to setting up a separate search service. It’s a solid starting point that you can implement and scale within your existing Postgres database. I won’t go into why you should Just Use Postgres™ for everything, but if you want to read about it, here are a couple of good resources: Postgres is all you need, even for vectors Just Use Postgres for Everything PostgreSQL is Enough Table with four legs This is the table we’ll work with as an example. create table documents ( id bigint primary key generated always as identity, title text, fts_title tsvector generated always as (to_tsvector('english', title)) stored, embedding vector(1536) ); We’ll evolve this table down the road. Since Supabase has a great article on implementing hybrid search, we’ll use that as a starting point. Hybrid search Follow the guide to implement FTS with GIN-indexes and semantic search with pgvector (also known as bi-encoder dense retrieval). From personal experience, I’d opt for 1536 dimensional embeddings since it’s gotten me way better results. Source: trust me. I’ve replaced the Supabase function with just CTEs and a query, as well as prefixed the params with $. Here’s what it’ll look like: with full_text as ( select id, -- Note: ts_rank_cd is not indexable but will only rank matches of the where clause -- which shouldn't be too big row_number() over(order by ts_rank_cd(fts_title, websearch_to_tsquery($query_text)) desc) as rank_ix from documents where fts_title @@ websearch_to_tsquery($query_text) order by rank_ix limit least($match_count, 30) ), semantic as ( select id, row_number() over (order by embedding$query_embedding) as rank_ix from documents order by rank_ix limit least($match_count, 30) ) select documents.* from full_text full outer join semantic on full_text.id = semantic.id join documents on coalesce(full_text.id, semantic.id) = documents.id order by coalesce(1.0 / ($rrf_k + full_text.rank_ix), 0.0) * $full_text_weight + coalesce(1.0 / ($rrf_k + semantic.rank_ix), 0.0) * $semantic_weight desc limit least($match_count, 30); Note: We’re using coalesce in several places for important reasons: In the join clause: join documents on coalesce(full_text.id, semantic.id) = documents.id This ensures that we include results from both full-text and semantic searches, even if a document appears in only one of these result sets. If a document is found by full-text search but not by semantic search (or vice versa), we still want to include it. In the order by clause: coalesce(1.0 / ($rrf_k + full_text.rank_ix), 0.0) * $full_text_weight + coalesce(1.0 / ($rrf_k + semantic.rank_ix), 0.0) * $semantic_weight This handles cases where a document might be present in one search result but not the other. If a document isn’t in the full-text results, its full_text.rank_ix will be NULL, so we use coalesce to treat it as 0.0 in the ranking calculation. The same applies for semantic search results. Here we’re using Reciprocal Ranked Fusion (RRF) to merge the results. List 3 List 2 List 1 C A B B C A A B C RRF Final Ranking A B C This method ensures that items ranked high in multiple lists are given a high rank in the final list. It also ensures that items ranked high in only a few lists but low in others are not given a high rank in the final list. Placing the rank in the denominator when calculating score helps penalize the low ranking records. It’s also worth noting: $rrf_k: To prevent extremely high scores for items ranked first (since we’re dividing by the rank), a k constant is often added to the denominator to smooth the score. $ _weight: We can assign a weight to each method. This is very useful when you’re tuning the results. Implementing fuzzy search While this gets us a long way, an immediate issue will be typos in named entities. While semantic search eliminates some of these issues by capturing similarity, it struggles to do so for names, acronyms, and other text that’s not semantically similar. To mitigate this, we’ll introduce the pg_trgm extension to allow for fuzzy searching. create extension if not exists pg_trgm; It operates with Trigrams. Here’s how it works: Trigrams are useful for fuzzy search because they break down words into three-character sequences. This allows for matching similar words even if they contain typos or slight variations. For example, “hello” and “helo” share many trigrams, making them easier to match in a fuzzy search. You have to create a new index for the desired column like this: create index idx_documents_title_trgm on documents using gin (title gin_trgm_ops); After that, you need to add it to the full search query. The extension exposes the % operator to filter out text where similarity is larger than pg_trgm.similarity_threshold (default is 0.3). There are also several other operators that are useful. Everything is well documented here: pg_trgm — support for similarity of text using trigram matching Here’s the new query with fuzzy searching implemented: with fuzzy as ( select id, similarity(title, $query_text) as sim_score, row_number() over (order by similarity(title, $query_text) desc) as rank_ix from documents where title % $query_text order by rank_ix limit least($match_count, 30) ), full_text as ( select id, ts_rank_cd(to_tsvector('english', title), websearch_to_tsquery($query_text)) as rank_score, row_number() over (order by ts_rank_cd(to_tsvector('english', title), websearch_to_tsquery($query_text)) desc) as rank_ix from documents where to_tsvector('english', title) @@ websearch_to_tsquery($query_text) order by rank_ix limit least($match_count, 30) ), semantic as ( select id, row_number() over (order by embedding$query_embedding) as rank_ix from documents order by rank_ix limit least($match_count, 30) ) select documents.* from fuzzy full outer join full_text on fuzzy.id = full_text.id full outer join semantic on coalesce(fuzzy.id, full_text.id) = semantic.id join documents on coalesce(fuzzy.id, full_text.id, semantic.id) = documents.id order by coalesce(1.0 / ($rrf_k + fuzzy.rank_ix), 0.0) * $fuzzy_weight + coalesce(1.0 / ($rrf_k + full_text.rank_ix), 0.0) * $full_text_weight + coalesce(1.0 / ($rrf_k + semantic.rank_ix), 0.0) * $semantic_weight desc limit least($match_count, 30); Debugging the rankings When getting the results back, it’s very useful to understand why something matched and not. First, we need to ensure we’re returning all scores from the various CTEs. semantic as ( select id, 1 - (embedding$query_embedding) as cosine_similarity, ) Next, we need to actually include it in the final response. I’ve found it useful to store as a JSON object that you can pass around however you want. select ... json_build_object( 'fuzzy', json_build_object('rank_ix', fuzzy.rank_ix, 'sim_score', fuzzy.sim_score), 'full_text', json_build_object('rank_ix', full_text.rank_ix, 'rank_score', full_text.rank_score), 'semantic', json_build_object('rank_ix', semantic.rank_ix, 'cosine_similarity', semantic.cosine_similarity) ) as rankings ... Here’s what it’ll look like: { \"rankings\": { \"fuzzy\": { \"rank_ix\": 5, \"sim_score\": 0.6 }, \"full_text\": { \"rank_ix\": 4, \"rank_score\": 0.756 }, \"semantic\": { \"rank_ix\": 1, \"cosine_similarity\": 0.912 } } } Tuning full text search Weighing tsvectors Now, your actual documents might actually include some content and not just a title. Let’s go ahead and add a body column. create table documents ( id bigint primary key generated always as identity, title text, body text, fts_title tsvector generated always as (to_tsvector('english', title)) stored, fts_body tsvector generated always as (to_tsvector('english', body)) stored, embedding vector(1536) ); As you can see, we’ll only keep a single embedding column even though we have multiple fields. Personally, I’ve found no significant performance in keeping multiple embeddings, but instead keeping both title and body in the same. After all, the title should™ be a short representation of the body. I encourage you to experiment with this based on your needs. Now, let’s look at the fts_ columns. We expect the title to be short and keyword-rich, while the body will be longer and include more details. Thus we need to adjust how the full text search columns are weighed against each other. Read the docs to get a better understanding here: 12.3.3. Ranking Search Results. Here’s the tl;dr: Weights allow prioritizing words based on their location or importance in the document. A-weight: Most important (e.g., title, headers). Default 1.0 B-weight: Important (e.g., beginning of document, abstract). Default 0.4 C-weight: Standard importance (e.g., main body text). Default 0.2 D-weight: Least important (e.g., footnotes, annotations). Default 0.1 Adjust weights to fine-tune relevance based on document structure and application needs. The title is given more weight than the body because it’s typically a concise representation of the document’s main topic. Users often scan titles first when searching, so matching keywords in the title are usually more relevant to the user’s intent than matches in the body text. With this information, we can go ahead and update the indexes: create table documents ( id bigint primary key generated always as identity, title text, body text, fts_title tsvector generated always as (setweight(to_tsvector('english', coalesce(title, '')), 'A')) stored, fts_body tsvector generated always as (setweight(to_tsvector('english', coalesce(body, '')), 'C')) stored, embedding vector(1536) ); This will make the title have a weight of 1.0 and body a weight of 0.2. Like before, we’ll add the new fts_body to the final query. I’ve also renamed the previous full_text to fts_title. ... fts_body as ( select id, ts_rank_cd(fts_body, websearch_to_tsquery($query_text)) as rank_score, row_number() over (order by ts_rank_cd(fts_body, websearch_to_tsquery($query_text)) desc) as rank_ix from documents where fts_body @@ websearch_to_tsquery($query_text) order by rank_ix limit least($match_count, 30) ), ... And the combined query select documents.*, coalesce(1.0 / ($rrf_k + fuzzy.rank_ix), 0.0) * $fuzzy_weight + coalesce(1.0 / ($rrf_k + fts_title.rank_ix), 0.0) * $fts_title_weight + coalesce(1.0 / ($rrf_k + fts_body.rank_ix), 0.0) * $fts_body_weight + coalesce(1.0 / ($rrf_k + semantic.rank_ix), 0.0) * $semantic_weight as combined_rank, json_build_object( 'fuzzy', json_build_object('rank_ix', fuzzy.rank_ix, 'sim_score', fuzzy.sim_score), 'fts_title', json_build_object('rank_ix', fts_title.rank_ix, 'rank_score', fts_title.rank_score), 'fts_body', json_build_object('rank_ix', fts_body.rank_ix, 'rank_score', fts_body.rank_score), 'semantic', json_build_object('rank_ix', semantic.rank_ix, 'cosine_similarity', semantic.cosine_similarity) ) as debug_rankings from fuzzy full outer join fts_title on fuzzy.id = fts_title.id full outer join fts_body on coalesce(fuzzy.id, fts_title.id) = fts_body.id full outer join semantic on coalesce(fuzzy.id, fts_title.id, fts_body.id) = semantic.id join documents on coalesce(fuzzy.id, fts_title.id, fts_body.id, semantic.id) = documents.id order by combined_rank desc limit least($match_count, 30); Adjusting for length If you read the documentation for ts_rank_cd you saw that there’s a normalization parameter. If not, here it is: Both ranking functions take an integer normalization option that specifies whether and how a document’s length should impact its rank. The integer option controls several behaviors, so it is a bit mask: you can specify one or more behaviors using(for example, 2|4). We can use these various options to: Adjust for document length bias Balance relevance across diverse document sets Scale ranking results for consistent presentation Option Value When to Use Use Case No normalization (0) When you want raw ranking scores without adjustments Comparing documents of similar length and structure Log length normalization (1) When you want to mildly reduce the impact of document length Mixed-length documents where longer docs shouldn’t dominate Length normalization (2) When you want to strongly normalize by document length Diverse document lengths where content density matters more than total matches Harmonic mean distance (ts_rank_cd only) (4) When you want to consider term proximity in ranking Phrases or closely related terms are important in your search Unique word normalization (8) When you want to favor documents with more diverse vocabulary Rewarding content richness over repetition Log unique word normalization (16) When you want to mildly reduce the impact of vocabulary diversity Balancing between vocabulary richness and raw term frequency Scaling to 0-1 range (32) When you need a consistent score range for all queries Displaying scores as percentages or progress bars Combine options using bitwise OR (|) for more nuanced normalization. For example: Use 2|4 to normalize by both length and term proximity Use 1|8 for a balanced approach considering both document length and vocabulary diversity I’ve found good results with setting 0 (no normalization) for the title and 1 (logarithmic doc length) for the body. Again, I encourage you to experiment with different options to find the best fit for your use case. Reranking with cross-encoder Many retrieval systems are two-step based. This means you’ll use a bi-directional encoder to retrieve the initial N results, then a cross-encoder to rank these against the search query. The bi-encoder is fast, making it great for searching a multitude of documents. The cross-encoder is slower but more performant, making it great for reranking retrieved results. Cross-encoders differ from bi-encoders in that they process the query and document together, allowing for more nuanced understanding of the relationship between them. This results in better ranking accuracy but at the cost of computation time and scalability. Here’s a simple diagram to illustrate the process: FTS documents Semantic Search documents Fuzzy documents Rerank with Cross-encoder model Final documents There are a bunch of different tools out there to do this. One of the best is Cohere’s Rerank. Another way is to build your own with GPT from OpenAI. Boosting results to improve UX To provide an even better user experience, you might want to boost certain columns depending on your use case. For example, in a knowledge search, you might want to boost search results that the user has interacted with. You also might want to boost recently changed results. Boosting recent results or user-specific results can improve UX because it personalizes the search experience. Recent results are often more relevant, especially for time-sensitive information. User-specific boosts can surface content the user has previously found useful, making their search more efficient. After Boosting Before Boosting 1. Result C 2. Result A 3. Result E 4. Result B 5. Result D 1. Result A 2. Result B 3. Result C 4. Result D 5. Result E Assuming we have updated_at and updated_by columns in our documents table, we could implement it like this: select ... -- Recency boost (1 + $recency_boost * (1 - extract(epoch from (now() - documents.updated_at)) / extract(epoch from (now() - '2020-01-01'::timestamp)))) * -- User boost case when documents.updated_by = $current_user_id then (1 + $user_boost) else 1 end as combined_rank, json_build_object( ... 'recency_boost', (1 - extract(epoch from (now() - documents.updated_at)) / extract(epoch from (now() - '2020-01-01'::timestamp))), 'user_boost', case when documents.updated_by = $current_user_id then $user_boost else 0 end ) as debug_rankings When should I look for alternative solutions? While Postgres is a solid choice for many search scenarios, it’s not without limitations. The lack of advanced algorithms like BM25 can be felt when dealing with diverse document lengths. Postgres’s reliance on TF-IDF for full-text search can struggle with very long documents and rare terms in large collections. Edit: Postgres actually doesn’t use TF-IDF for full-text search. Its built-in ranking functions (ts_rank and ts_rank_cd) primarily consider term frequency within individual documents and term proximity, but don’t take into account corpus-wide statistics. This approach can still struggle with very long documents and doesn’t inherently account for the rarity of terms across the entire collection. Make sure to measure before you look into alternative solutions. Chances are, it might not be worth it. Bonus: adding BM25 Unlike Postgres’s FTS, BM25 considers corpus-wide statistics and document length normalization. Here are some of the reaons you might want to use it: Better handling of document length variations Improved relevance for rare terms Accounts for diminishing returns of term frequency Industry standard in information retrieval And here are some extensions you can install go get BM25 going: pg_search pg_bestmatch.rs Conclusion We’ve covered a lot of ground in this post, from basic full-text search to advanced techniques like fuzzy matching, semantic search, and result boosting. By leveraging Postgres’s powerful features, you can create a robust and flexible search engine tailored to your specific needs. Postgres might not be the first tool that comes to mind for search, but it gets you really far. Remember, the key to a great search experience is continuous iteration and fine-tuning. Use the debugging techniques we discussed to understand how your search is performing, and don’t be afraid to adjust weights and parameters based on user feedback and behavior.

Postgresql has a few alright tools to do vector search and to do some simple things with trigrams. And that can work well for some narrow use cases. If that's all you need, great. But this doesn't give you a whole lot of control over search ranking. And if search is in anyway on the critical path to revenue for whatever it is your product does, you probably need to invest in making sure your users find what they need.

Won't even comment on ES b/c they already target analytics better than search. I think it is worth exploring pg and other tools as all search cases are narrow/specific (ecomm, graphs, domain-specific documents etc), specially if you need facets and filtering. Also multilanguage ok to consider for a tool but products usually look for better recall at their original lang then to have same results in other languages. reply danielheath 10 hours agorootparentprevI agree with you, but to be fair, that's true of virtually every technology I've encountered in my career. reply philippemnoel 7 hours agoparentprevParadeDB pg_search supports tokenizers in all major languages reply troupo 6 hours agorootparentGood find/tip!

That'll be different depending on the language, you can't simply transliterate words to another language, the mapping may change things and the rules might be different. For example, in English \"manage / managers\", are practically the same, but transliterating to Spanish can give you \"gestionan / gerentes\", which diverge very early on. reply pezezin 9 hours agorootparentAlternatively you could use \"gestor\", which has the same stem. \"Gestionar\" and \"gerente\" have different origins, so no wonder they look very different. But yes, most (all?) European languages have vastly more complex morphology than English. reply troupo 12 hours agorootparentprevBecause search in different languages needs to be aware of that language's peculiarities.

Postgre is not serverless, so it is not easy to separate read and write, and it is not easy to auto scaling By the time you're hitting the limitations of vertical scaling a single do-everything instance of Postgres on cloud infrastructure, you're making boatloads of money and can afford to stand up something else for search. And besides which, creating read replicas horizontally is very doable. Though to be fair, I wouldn't implement moderately complex search on postgres, just because there are better tools for the job. Keeping data consistent between multiple systems though is \"involved\", and there's therefore a good argument for doing search in Postgres if your needs are simple. reply hamandcheese 9 hours agorootparentYou don't have to be that big for mixed workloads to cause issues for a do-everything PG instance. Imagine a scenario where read-heavy but infrequent search queries end up pushing, say, your sessions table out of cache. Postgres has no facilities for earmarking cache for one table vs another, so the noisy neighbor problem is real, and hard to fix. You can throw money/ram at it, but that's needlessly expensive if you have some workloads that don't require that level of performance. reply LunaSea 6 hours agorootparentYou can get 512GB RAM and 96 core machines for $1000 / month and at that point you can throw any workload on it. reply ForHackernews 8 hours agorootparentprevParent comment already mentioned read-replicas. The main problem I've seen is companies allowing tables to grow enormous because they never partition (by year, for instance) or archive out old stale data. reply wvh 6 hours agoparentprevMulti-master is not common, but it's easy to have a single master and multiple read-only slaves (with failover), though of course you're going to have to configure your application's database/ORM layer to handle multiple servers. That requires a bit of effort, but then you're set for running analytic queries on a completely different database or column store later on if you choose to do so. I'm not saying you don't need multi-master, but I've worked on several large projects and one Postgres database can handle a lot of traffic. My first solution is to offload analytic queries to read-only instances or pull data into a column store for \"offline\" processing. Just make sure you don't get stuck into some ancient ORM or application framework. There are several Kubernetes operators that are moving towards more complex topologies, so I think a lot of innovation and progress is happening somewhat outside of core Postgres itself, building on functionality already present within. reply samwillis 8 hours agoparentprevWhile both points are true now, there is a lot of work happing to bring both column storage and separate compute and storage to Postgres. The pg_duck project has the eventual aim to implement a column storage engine for Postgres. There are a few steps to get there as it needs to be tied into the Postgres page storage and replication system. So it's not solved by the first version of pg_duck, but the team is incredible and I believe it will happen. Neon and Oriole (acquired by Supabase) are both open source and separate storage and compute. There is a few steps more for them to go to be truly usable self hosted, but they will get there, and some of the work they are doing will hopefully be upstreamed. reply lettergram 6 hours agoprevI wrote a post how to do full-text search back in 2018: https://austingwalters.com/fast-full-text-search-in-postgres...

    "originBody": "Lidl’s Cloud Gambit: Europe’s Shift to Sovereign Computing Dotan Horovits (@horovits) · Follow 3 min read · 7 hours ago -- “How Lidl accidentally took on the big guns of cloud computing” — this article published yesterday in the Financial Times caught my attention. It shed light on an unexpected player in the cloud computing arena — Lidl, the European discount retailer known for its no-frills approach to groceries. Remember the story of how AWS started some 20 years ago, as the Amazon retailer wanted to solve its own IT infrastructure needs? Now Lidl and its owner Schwarz Group is pulling the proverbial AWS play, and spinning up its internal IT unit, Schwarz Digits, into a standalone operating division, which competes with AWS. According to FT, it positioned itself as a credible regional challenger against the likes of AWS, Google, and Microsoft. This move is not just an isolated case but part of a broader trend in Europe towards sovereign cloud computing. Disruption Ahead: AWS Quietly Axing Services Amazon is quietly deprecating Cloud9, SimpleDB, CodeCommit and more services. horovits.medium.com As I pointed out in my previous blog post about the shifts in AWS, the one-stop-cloud-shop approach has shown cracks. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba et al. won’t be able to cover all grounds, neither in tech domains, nor in geo’s. This realization comes at a time when European countries, led by Germany and Austria, are increasingly prioritizing stringent privacy and data protection laws. GDPR compliance is non-negotiable, and businesses are demanding cloud services that operate entirely within the EU’s borders and address these control and sovereignty needs. In essence, Europe is looking for its own “EuroCloud”. This demand isn’t just theoretical. The EU has already taken concrete steps with initiatives like Gaia-X, which sets the framework for what an EU cloud should look like — sovereign, secure, and compliant with European regulations. gaia-x.eu This push for a EuroCloud is why a grocery chain like Lidl can suddenly emerge as a cloud player, grabbing market share from AWS. Schwarz Digits generated €1.9 billion in sales last year and has signed on major clients like SAP and Bayern Munich. This is no fringe experiment. The StackIT page features a service list ranging from the basic compute-network-storage through managed databases, messaging, Kubernetes, monitoring, security and more. This is something AWS is scrambling to address with its recent announcement of a €7.8 billion investment in an AWS European Sovereign Cloud, expected to launch its first region in Germany by the end of 2025. But will that be enough to regain the trust of European corporations The pricing factor is another interesting angle. Lidl disrupted the retail market with its low-cost groceries; can it do the same in cloud computing? With Schwarz Digits, could Lidl become the low-cost EuroCloud alternative that businesses are looking for? AWS’s challenge will be to convince these businesses that its new European Sovereign Cloud can offer the same level of trust, security, and affordability. As we watch this play out, it’s clear that the days of one-stop-cloud-shops are numbered. The market is fragmenting, and specialized, regionally-focused providers like Schwarz Digits are stepping in to fill the gaps left by global giants.",

The article misrepresents it. Gaia-X is not a framework for what a European cloud should look like. This would be useful. In beautiful EU bureaucratic style It's a framework for how to talk about how a European Cloud could look like. It's not about technical standards. It's about how we can talk about how we can think of maybe eventually deciding on how we can come up with standards that might one day lead to talk about implementations. It represents to me everything that is wrong with the EU today. A bureaucratic monster that can't decide how to talk about things or come to any form of alignment. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 0 minutes agoparentWhile most Western governments have gotten increasingly good at communicating with their citizens (i.e. making their web sites and forms accessible in human language, rather than bureaucrat language), and often even go so far as to offer versions in \"Simple English\" or local-language equivalents, the EU seems to be going the opposite way. I'd consider myself reasonably accustomed to and able to deal with bureaucracy and formal language, and still find every interaction with official EU sites massively off-putting.

A completely independent \"local\" provider, with full rights over every aspect of the technology, no strings attached, isn't \"side stepping\". It's probably the goal for all intents and purposes. If they get the recipe for making the cake, and the right to modify and use it in perpetuity then it's good. The goal here isn't to say \"a local wrote every line of code\", it's to ensure the sovereignty. If there are still legal or technical strings to be pulled from outside it's not very sovereign. Open source and open standards are the closest to a blueprint for the success of such an initiative. The gaps would be filled by regulations, with mandates for the public sector and critical functions, and incentives for private companies who use and contribute to this. Personal opinion, EU leadership has fallen a long way in the past decades, and are now well into a combination of criminal and incompetent (whereas before they were maybe only marginally criminal but at least competent overall).

But aside from the weird paperwork overhead, we were fairly free in how we approached the project, and we got a lot of shit done. This was software R&D in the true sense. I don't know what happened to the project after I left, but I suspect the universities involved benefited from the research and some of it was probably spun off. That is to say: it's not all just paperwork and paychecks, it can be greatly rewarding work. [1] Strangely enough I was just talking about another aspect of air quality in another HN thread.

It's just that we also have a lot of \"token projects\" which serve for virtual signaling for topics where there is a lack of domestic competence.

For the Germany region, they're using a mixture of technical controls (e.g., the AWS user has to sign off on accesses in a way that's technically not circumventable (think like a phones unlock screen or something protecting the data on the device) and only allowing AWS employees located in the EU to operate it (presumably the goal being that employees physically located in the EU can't be compelled in the same way as those located in the US).

    "originBody": "AMD’s Radeon 890M: Strix Point’s Bigger iGPU August 24, 2024 clamchowder 5 Comments AMD’s iGPUs have seen plenty of recent success. Handheld gaming devices like Valve’s Steam Deck and Asus’s ROG Ally both use AMD integrated graphics. AMD’s last generation mobile offering, codenamed Phoenix, already did well against Intel and Qualcomm’s competing products. Strix Point, AMD’s latest mobile chip, looks to continue that strong performance. It gets an even larger GPU than before, along with a slight architecture upgrade. Generation GPU CPU Strix Point, 2024 (Ryzen AI 9 HX 370) 8x RDNA 3.5 WGPs 4x Zen 5 Mobile + 8x Zen 5c Mobile Phoenix, 2023 (Ryzen 7 7840HS) 6x RDNA 3 WGPs 8x Zen 4 Rembrandt, 2022 (Ryzen 7 6800HS) 6x RDNA 2 WGPs 8x Zen 3 Van Gogh, 2022 (Steam Deck) 4x RDNA 2 WGPs 4x Zen 2 Cezanne, 2021 8x Vega CUs 8x Zen 3 We previously covered RDNA 3.5’s architecture changes in a separate article, so be sure to check that out. The Ryzen AI 9 HX 370’s Radeon 890M is designated GFX1150, which corresponds to the cut down variant of RDNA 3.5 with 128 KB vector register files. Acknowledgments We would like to thank ASUS for providing a laptop for review. Overview GPUs from AMD’s RDNA line are built from Workgroup Processors (WGPs), which vaguely correspond to cores from the CPU world. The Radeon 890M has eight WGPs. AMD used six WGPs in two prior generations of iGPUs, so Strix Point gets a substantial increase in GPU size. Strix Point’s GPU side memory subsystem remains very similar to the one on Phoenix. WGPs are partitioned into two shader arrays, each with a 256 KB L1 mid-level cache. Each L1 cache instance now serves four WGPs instead of three. The entire iGPU shares a 2 MB L2 cache, and connects to the rest of the chip via four 32 byte per cycle Infinity Fabric ports. Infinity Fabric is AMD’s network-on-chip, and can run at up to 2 GHz on Strix Point. A 4x32B/cycle link may feel like overkill, but it lets Infinity Fabric run at a less aggressive 1.6 GHz while still giving the iGPU access to full LPDDR5 bandwidth. Since a large part of a chip’s power budget can be consumed doing data transfers, running the interconnect at a lower frequency could help save power during graphics workloads. AMD continues to use a LPDDR5-capable memory controller, with support for up to LPDDR5-7500. Our test device from Asus uses exactly that, providing 120 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth. While Phoenix’s memory controller can support the same speed, the fastest Phoenix memory configuration we tested with was LPDDR5-6400 in the Ryzen Z1 Extreme. Intel’s Meteor Lake does get a similarly high bandwidth LPDDR5-7467 configuration in the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED. Cache and Memory Characteristics Cache latency on Strix Point’s iGPU is almost exactly a match for its predecessor. Higher clock speeds do put AMD’s latest iGPU ahead by a hair. Compared to Intel’s Meteor Lake, AMD continues to use more cache levels than its competitors. Meteor Lake has a large and fast first level cache, backed by a L2 with twice as much capacity as AMD’s. DRAM latency has also improved, though the difference between Strix Point and Phoenix again isn’t large. Meteor Lake suffers much higher DRAM access latency from its iGPU. In AMD tradition, RDNA 3.5 has a scalar memory access path. Testing with scalar accesses doesn’t show any surprises. The scalar path offers lower latency, with AMD’s mid-level L1 matching Meteor Lake’s first level L1. AMD’s 16 KB scalar cache therefore acts like a L0 cache of sorts, even though AMD only applies that designation to the vector cache. Strix Point’s memory subsystem needs to provide more bandwidth to feed its extra compute, and AMD doesn’t disappoint. First level cache bandwidth scales with WGP count, and is much higher. The mid-level L1 caches get a bit more strain because each instance now serves four WGPs instead of three, but that’s still within the capabilities of AMD’s L1 design, as AMD’s high end 7900 XTX also makes one L1 instance handle four WGPs. L2 bandwidth continues to be impressive at 1.7 TB/s, though the increase here is minor compared to Phoenix. Meteor Lake has less cache bandwidth across the board, though its larger L2 cache does give it an advantage. Intel’s iGPU L2 has less bandwidth than AMD’s, but 1 TB/s is still nothing to sneeze at. With LPDDR5-7500, Strix Point gets somewhat better bandwidth than Meteor Lake or Phoenix. It’s a hair behind Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite, which feeds its Adreno GPU with top end LPDDR5X. Stepping back, it’s impressive how moder n iGPUs have comparable bandwidth to low end GDDR5-equipped GPUs of the past. LPDDR has done a lot to enable faster iGPUs. Valve’s Steam Deck is another notable comparison. Even though it launched two years ago, the Steam Deck is still a current generation product. However, the Steam Deck’s APU is sorely dated, with a small RDNA 2 GPU running at a very low 1.6 GHz clock. 1.6 GHz is well below the efficiency sweet spot on desktop RDNA 2 products. As a result, Van Gogh has far less cache bandwidth than modern contenders. Adreno X1 is an exception, with very poor cache bandwidth for a current generation iGPU. Besides the global memory hierarchy backed by DRAM, GPU code can explicitly keep frequently used data in on-chip local memory. Local memory is local to each workgroup in OpenCL, but in exchange offers guaranteed low latency and high bandwidth. AMD implements local memory with a 128 KB Local Data Share (LDS) in each WGP. Total LDS bandwidth is quite high for an integrated GPU, stopping just short of 5 TB/s. LDS latency has significantly improved, and it’s not just from a slight clock speed bump. It’s a welcome change, and puts RDNA 3 well ahead of its immediate competitors. Local memory can also be used to exchange data between a workgroup’s threads. With a thread-to-thread latency test, RDNA 3.5 acts like RDNA 3. There’s little difference between pointer chasing latency within a single thread, and data exchanges between threads. That’s a good thing, because it means RDNA 3.5’s low LDS latency benefits atomics too. Global memory atomics are more generally applicable because they allow data exchange between any of a kernel’s threads. Latency is higher of course because transfers can’t be kept in a WGP. However, Strix Point’s iGPU manages to improve latency with global memory atomics despite its increased size. Compute Throughput RDNA 3.5 inherits RDNA 3’s dual issue mechanism, which lets one wavefront start 64 FP operations per cycle. That can be done either with wave64 mode, or dual issue instructions in wave32 mode. Strix Point’s GPU is also scaled up compared to Phoenix’s. As a result, AMD has packed massive compute throughput into an iGPU. The Radeon 890M pushes past 5 TFLOPS, and past 10 TFLOPS if you count a fused multiply-add as two operations. It’s a clear improvement over Phoenix, and often on a different planet compared to the still current generation Steam Deck APU. With special function operations like inverse square roots, Strix Point has less of a relative advantage because RDNA 3(.5)’s dual issue doesn’t apply. Still, having a bigger and much higher clocking GPU counts for a lot. Integer operations often show up in games too, and the Radeon 890M is no slouch with those. It’s a stark contrast when compared to what we saw in Qualcomm’s Adreno X1, which generally had poor integer performance. Strix Point does well even with 64-bit integers, which are rarely used in games. GPUs typically do 64-bit integer adds with two 32-bit add-with-carry instructions, and it seems like those instructions execute at full rate here. CPU to GPU Bandwidth Integrated GPUs like the one on Strix Point are more power and area constrained than their discrete desktop counterparts. But sharing a memory bus with the CPU does come with an advantage when moving data between CPU and GPU memory spaces. With clEnqueueWriteBuffer or clEnqueueReadBuffer, Strix Point can use its LPDDR5 controller to get nearly 38 GB/s of copy bandwidth. It’s comfortably above the 32 GB/s that a PCIe 4.0 x16 link would offer. AMD also pulls ahead of Meteor Lake with a similarly high bandwidth LPDDR5 configuration, perhaps indicating AMD has better DMA engines. Compute: FluidX3D FluidX3D simulates fluid behavior. Performance can be highly dependent on memory bandwidth, assuming the GPU in question is able to meet a baseline level of compute performance. Strix Point’s iGPU does very well, stepping ahead of Phoenix and Meteor Lake’s iGPUs. It also moves ahead of Nvidia’s Pascal based GTX 1050 3 GB, showing the strength of LPDDR5 for latency tolerant GPU workloads. However, gains are minor because the workload is bandwidth bound. Cyberpunk 2077 Cyberpunk 2077 is a modern DirectX 12 game. At low settings and 1080P resolution, the Radeon 890M turns in a good performance. It clearly steps ahead of Phoenix, already had a solid iGPU. A larger GPU needs a larger power budget to shine, and Asus’s laptop is able to give it exactly that. Battery discharge rate as measured through HWInfo was around 50W. It’s quite a bit higher than the battery discharge rate on the Meteor Lake, Phoenix, and Snapdragon X Elite laptops tested. But it’s worth it, because AMD does get more FPS per watt than the Snapdragon X Elite. If Strix Point’s SoC power gets pulled back to 15W for 20-21W of battery draw, average FPS drops to 30 FPS. At that point, AMD’s newest GPU is able to maintain competitive performance with Intel’s Meteor Lake at lower power. Final Words As the latest installment in AMD’s iGPU journey, the RDNA 3.5 iGPU in Strix Point does its job well. Performance improves compared to AMD’s already solid iGPU in Phoenix. Other than having more GPU cores running at slightly higher clock speeds, Strix Point doesn’t change a lot compared to its predecessor. RDNA 3.5’s improvements are welcome, but they’re minor as expected for a half-generation update. AMD’s GPU-side cache and memory subsystem uses the same strategy as before. It’s a bit boring considering Intel has a larger L2 cache, and Qualcomm is playing with a 6 MB System Level Cache on their Snapdragon X Elite (of which about 2.5 MB appears usable to the iGPU). But boring might be the best answer here. Phoenix undeniably did well despite having less last level cache than its competitors. Strix Point appears to do the same, comfortably outdoing its competition. AMD is able to feed its iGPU with less caching, and without going for the most expensive LPDDR5X memory around. Making sweeping changes is always risky, as Netburst and AMD’s own Bulldozer have shown. With Strix Point, AMD is not fixing things that aren’t broken. Strix Point’s move to RDNA 3.5 does show that AMD is focusing harder on the iGPU side than before. Not too long ago, AMD iGPUs would use hilariously out of date graphics architectures. AMD launched the Cezanne chip in 2021 with Vega graphics, which is largely similar to the original GCN architecture that launched in 2011. In 2021, AMD’s desktop discrete GPUs used the RDNA 2 architecture. Longer ago, AMD launched Trinity APUs with Terascale 3 graphics when their desktop GPUs had already moved to GCN. With Strix Point, AMD’s mobile iGPU has a newer graphics architecture than its desktop counterparts. It’s an unprecedented situation, but not a surprising one. Since the DX11 era, AMD has never been able to take and hold the top spot in the discrete GPU market. Nvidia has been building giant chips where cost is no object for a long time, and they’re good at it. Perhaps AMD sees lower power gaming as a market segment where they can really excel. Strix Point seems to be a reflection of that. LLVM commits also support a higher end RDNA 3.5 variant, designated GFX1151 and referred to as “Strix Halo”. Of course adding LLVM support does not mean a product is on the way. But it shows AMD is looking very seriously at what they can do with big integrated GPUs. And I look forward to seeing how AMD’s mobile graphics strategy plays out.

I have a laptop with a 680M and a mini pc with a 780M both beefy enough to play around with small LLM. You basically have to force the gpu detection to an older version, and I get tons of gpu resets on both. AMD your hardware is good please give the software more love. reply hedora 3 hours agoparentI recently tried to setup Linux on a few machines with nvidia and AMD GPUs, and, while AMD could improve, they're way ahead of nvidia on all fronts except machine learning. Nvidia's drivers are still uniformly garbage (as they have been for the last 20 years) across the board, but they do work sometimes, and I guess they're better for machine learning. I have a pile of \"supported\" nvidia cards that can't run most opengl / glx software, even after installing dkms, recompiling the planet, etc, etc, etc. Since AMD upstreamed their stuff into the kernel, everything just works out of the box, but you're stuck with rocm. So, for all use cases except machine learning, AMD's software blows Nvidia's out of the water for me. This includes running Windows games, which works better under Linux than Windows (the last time I checked), thanks to Steam. On my 780m, I installed current devuan (~= debian) stable, and had a few xscreensaver crashes and reboots. I checked dmesg, and it had clear errors about irq state machines being wrong for some of the radeon stuff. So, even when running future hardware, their error logs are great. After enabling backports and upgrading the kernel, the dmesg errors went away, and it's a 100% uptime machine. The remaining hardware problem is that pulseaudio is still terrible after all these years, so I have to repeatedly switch audio out to hdmi. reply colordrops 1 hour agorootparentUse pipewire instead of pulseaudio. Much better. reply hedora 1 hour agorootparentI would have already switched, but, apparently, the pipewire authors decided it shouldn't daemonize properly: https://dev1galaxy.org/viewtopic.php?id=5867 Taking a dependency on systemd is a strange choice for a project who's entire point is ripping out Poettering's second-to-last train wreck. reply dannyw 7 hours agoparentprevAMD doesn't realise the wide penetration and availability of CUDA is what makes the ecosystem so strong. Developers can develop and test on their personal devices which are prevalent, and that's what creates such a big software ecosystem for the expensive chips. When I raised this feedback with our AMD Rep, they said it was intentional and that consumer GPUs are primarily meant for gaming. Absolutely shortsighted. reply brookst 3 hours agorootparentI can forgive AMD for not seeing how important CUDA was ten years ago. Nvidia was both smart and lucky. But failing to see it five years ago is inexcusable. Missing it two years ago is insane. And still failing to treat ML as an existential threat is, IDK, I’ve got no words. reply carlmr 7 hours agorootparentprevIt's either strategic incompetence, technical incompetence, or both at this point. reply ahartmetz 6 hours agorootparentAt least they seem to be seriously trying to fix it now. https://www.techpowerup.com/324171/amd-is-becoming-a-softwar... reply anaisbetts 2 hours agorootparentprevI suspect that it is legal fears tbh - it is almost certain that if AMD or anyone else tried to make some kind of CUDA compatibility, nVidia would pretty fiercely sue them into the ground. This is almost certainly why both Intel and AMD bailed on ZLUDA. reply carlmr 6 minutes agorootparentThey don't need compatibility but functionality in the first place. Most AI workloads use an abstraction layer anyway, e.g. pytorch. reply stuaxo 4 hours agoparentprevHaving had AMS Ryzen laptops for the last 6 plus years, so much this. Right now I'm messing around trying to get pytorch vulkcan support compiling just so I avoid switching to ROCM. reply bornfreddy 9 hours agoprevInteresting: > With Strix Point, AMD’s mobile iGPU has a newer graphics architecture than its desktop counterparts. It’s an unprecedented situation, but not a surprising one. Since the DX11 era, AMD has never been able to take and hold the top spot in the discrete GPU market. Nvidia has been building giant chips where cost is no object for a long time, and they’re good at it. Perhaps AMD sees lower power gaming as a market segment where they can really excel. Strix Point seems to be a reflection of that. Did AMD figure out that this market segment is underserved by NVidia? If so, good for them, laptops could use better GPUs. reply dagmx 3 hours agoparentI doubt Strix Point is gunning for NVIDIA. It’s more than likely this is just a stronger play to get ahead of Intel in market share. That’s a much more tangible competitor in that space. Whether it means more games optimize for AMD as a side effect is tangential at best. Otherwise there’s no real reason to treat this as competing with NVIDIA. It’s an integrated GPU so it’s not moving any extra units. reply rishav_sharan 15 hours agoprevI love how well Intel's Arc iGPU and AMDs Strix Point iGPU are doing. I am planning to get an iGPU laptop with 64 Gb RAM. I plan on using local llms and image generators and hopefully with that large of shared RAM that shouldn't be too much of a problem. But I am worried that all LLM tools today are pretty much NVidia specific, and I wouldn't be able to get my local setup going. reply replete 8 hours agoparentI've noticed some BIOS' do not allow the full capacity of unified memory to be allocated, so if you do this check you can actually allocate 16GB, some are limited to 2 or 4GB, seemingly unnecessarily reply ComputerGuru 2 hours agorootparentApparently this is a legacy holdover and you should choose the smallest size in the bios. Fully unified memory is the norm, you don’t need to do the memory splitting that way. reply dagmx 14 hours agoparentprevCan they access the full RAM? Afaik they get capped to a portion of total available RAM. But to your other point, very little of the current popular ML stack does more than CUDA and MPS. Some will do rocm but I don’t know if the AMD iGPUs are guaranteed to support it? There’s not much for Intel GPUs. reply sillystuff 2 hours agorootparent> Some will do rocm but I don’t know if the AMD iGPUs are guaranteed to support it? If you only care about inference, llama.cpp supports Vulkan on any iGPU with Vulkan drivers. On my laptop with crap bios that does not allow changing any video ram settings, reserved \"vram\" is 2GB, but llama.cpp-vulkan can access 16GB of \"vram\" (half of physical ram). 16GB vram is sufficient to run any model that has even remotely practical execution speed on my bottom-of-the-line ryzen 3 3250U (Picasso/Raven 2); you can always offload some layers to CPU to run even larger. (on Debian stable) Vulkan support: apt install libvulkan1 mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-tools Build deps for llama.cpp: apt install libshaderc-dev glslang-dev libvulkan-dev Build llama.cpp with vulkan back-end: make clean (I added this, in case you previously built with a diff back-end) make LLAMA_VULKAN=1 If more than one GPU: When running, you have to set GGML_VK_VISIBLE_DEVICES to the indices of the devices you want e.g., export GGML_VK_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2 The indices correspond to the device order in vulkaninfo --summary. By default llama.cpp will only use the first device it finds. llama.cpp-vulkan has worked really well, for me. But, per benchmarks from back when Vulkan support was first released, using the CUDA back-end was faster than the Vulkan back-end on NVIDIA GPUs. Probably same Rocm vs Vulkan on AMD too. But, zero non-free / binary blobs required for Vulkan, and Vulkan supports more devices (e.g., my iGPU is not supported by Rocm)-- haven't tried, but you can probably mix GPUs from diff manufacturers using Vulkan. reply hedgehog 14 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on the API used, whether the data is in the region considered \"GPU memory\" or whether it's shared with the compute API from the app's memory space. Support is somewhat in flux and I haven't been following closely but if you're curious this is my bookmarked jumping of point (a PyTorch ticket about this): https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/107605 reply slavik81 12 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that as of Linux 6.10, the driver will now dynamically allocate more memory for the iGPU [1]. The driver team apparently reused a strategy that had been developed for MI300A. I'm hoping that in combination with the gfx11-generic ISA introduced in LLVM 18, this will make it straightforward to enable compute applications on both Phoenix and Strix (even if they are not officially supported by ROCm). [1]: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/lin... reply lhl 11 hours agorootparentOne issue is that even if you are using GTT (dynamically allocated memory), this is still limited as a percentage of total RAM. Eg, currently on my 7940HS, I have 64GB of memory, 8GB of dedicated VRAM (GART), and then a limit of 28GB of GTT - there is an amdgpu.gttsize parameter to \"Restrict the size of GTT domain in MiB for testing. The default is -1 (It’s VRAM size if 3GByou'll wait about 17 seconds before token generation starts, which isn't awful Let’s be honest, it might not be awful but it’s a nonstarter for encouraging local LLM adoption and most will prefer to pay to pay pennies for api access instead (friction aside). reply lhl 1 hour agorootparentI don't know why anyone would think a meh performing iGPU would encourage local LLM adoption at all? A 7B local model is already not going to match frontier models for many use cases - if you don't care about using a local model (don't have privacy or network concerns) then I'd argue you probably should use an API. If you care about using a capable local LLM comfortably, then you should get as powerful a dGPU as your power/dollar budget allows. Your best bang/buck atm will probably be Nvidia consumer Ada GPUs (or used Ampere models). However, if for anyone that is looking to use a local model on a chip with the Radeon 890M: - look into implementing (or waiting for) NPU support - XDNA2's 50 TOPS should provide more raw compute than the 890M for tensor math (w/ Block FP16) - use a smaller, more appropriate model for your use case (3B's or smaller can fulfill most simple requests) and of course will be faster - don't use long conversations - when your conversations start they will have 0 context and no prefill; no waiting for context - use `cache_prompt` for bs=1 interactive use you can save input/generations to cache reply szundi 6 hours agorootparentprevFor a lot of usecases it is actually awful reply aurareturn 4 hours agorootparentprev>Nobody cares about tokens per second the moment inference is faster than you can read, but staring down a blank screen for 5 minutes? Yikes. I don't think so. Humans scan for keywords very often. No body really reads every word. Faster than reading speed inference is definitely beneficial. reply brookst 3 hours agorootparentAnd thank you for making me conscious of my reading while reading your comment. May you become aware of your breathing. reply allen_fisher 14 hours agoparentprevI set up both stable diffusion and LLMs on my desktop without Nvidia GPU. Everything goes well. Stable diffusion can run on onnx backend on my AMD GPU, and LLMs run through gguf format through ollama on CPU, model scale and speed are limited though. reply torrance 16 hours agoprevThese results are promising and hopefully carry over to the upcoming Strix Halo which I’m eagerly awaiting. With a rumoured 40 compute cores and performance on par with a low power (The \"170%\" number is bogus. Actually, it's 253%. I made a mistake assuming the 890M was limited to 35w. It was actually 46w as measured by Notebookcheck.[0] >Reducing the power of 890M to 17 W, the same as quoted for M3, would reduce the performance much less than the reduction in power consumption, improving the energy efficiency. That depends. Sure, give almost any chip less power and it will be more efficient. I'm not arguing against that. The problem with reducing power for the 890M is that it's already slower than the M3 by 26% while using 2.7x the power. If you give the 890M 17w, yes, it will be more efficient than 46w. It just just be even slower than the M3. >The better performance of the Apple GPU could be entirely caused by the much higher memory bandwidth M3's bandwidth is 102.4 GB/s. AMD Strix Point uses LPDDR5X-7500 in dual channel mode so it should be around 120GB/s. >and by the better CMOS process used for the Apple GPU. AMD's Strix Point is manufactured on TSMC's N4P. M3 is on N3B, which is roughly 10% more power efficient than N4P. It doesn't explain the huge discrepancy in efficiency.

They come with the 780M and 680M processors, respectively, and both are outperformed by the 980M at a lower power draw [0]. Theoretically a consumer can't put these parts directly in a pc there's already a mini-pc with the laptop part 980M [1]. The 7800G sometimes shows up in mid-range and high-end gaming PCs with discrete graphics cards [2], which makes so little sense that I wonder if AMD quietly offloaded them in bulk at a steep discount to vendors.

    "title": "Looming Liability Machines (LLMs)",
    "originLink": "http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/08/looming-liability-machines.html",
    "originBody": "Looming Liability Machines (LLMs) - August 24, 2024 As part of our zoom reading group (wow, 4.5 years old now), we discussed a paper that uses LLMs for automatic root cause analysis (RCA) for cloud incidents. This was a pretty straightforward application of LLMs. The proposed system employs an LLM to match incoming incidents to incident handlers based on their alert types, predicts the incident's root cause category, and provides an explanatory narrative. The only customization is through prompt-engineering. Since this is a custom domain, I think a more principled and custom-designed machine learning system would be more appropriate rather than adopting LLMs. Anyways, the use of LLMs for RCAs spooked me vicerally. I couldn't find the exact words during the paper discussion, but I can articulate this better now. Let me explain. RCA is serious business Root cause analysis (RCA) is the process of identifying the underlying causes of a problem/incident, rather than just addressing its symptoms. One RCA heuristic is asking 5 Why's to push deeper into the cause-effect relationship. RCA should be done in a holistic (systems thinking) manner exploring the causes of a problem in different dimensions such as People, Process, Equipment, Materials, Environment, and Management. Finally, RCAs should consider relationships between the potential causes, as that may illuminate the pathways that lead to the problem. Nancy Leveson is a leading expert in safety engineering. She is known for her work on preventing accidents in complex systems like airplanes and power plants. She developed a method called STAMP (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes) that looks at how accidents happen due to failures in controlling these systems, not just technical faults or human mistakes. Leveson's approach focuses how different parts interact and influence each other. The incident analysis Nancy Leveson does for the Bhopal disaster is really eye-opening. The pipe washing operation should have been supervised by a second shift operator, but that position had been eliminated due to cost cutting. But why? As the plant lost money, many of the skilled workers left, and they were either not replaced, or replaced by unskilled workers. (Boeing might have succumbed to cost cutting pressures according to this article from 2019.) My worries about systemic failures So, safety engineering is a whole academic field with a lot of smart experts working on it. On the industry side, a lot of smart experts practice safety enginering, and possess a lot of wisdom. There are specialized go-to people in every big organization for these things. It would be very stupid if management decides that LLMs do a good job for RCA, and the company doesn't need human experts investigating these issues. Ok, maybe they won't be that careless, but I am still concerned this may lead to decline in developing new experts. If LLMs are adopted to perform RCA, companies may stop hiring and training new engineers in this crucial skill. I bet LLMs would not be able to deep root cause identification as experts could do. Consider the RCA is serious business section again. LLMs would not be able to dive deep, and produce superficial results. Furthermore, we should not get fixated on the \"root cause\" part of RCA. Most safety experts are alergic to the phrase root cause. An incident is often a systemic complex problem stemming from many things. So the analysis part, rather actually performing the analysis part is the more important thing. Through the analysis, the goal is to prevent the recurrence of similar issues, thereby improving processes, enhancing safety. If we offload the RCA learning/categorization part to the LLM (whatever that means), we wouldn't be able to make much progress in the enhancing reliability and safety part. In sum, I am worried that the use of LLMs for RCA will lead to cost cutting, and this will lead to systemic failures in the mid-long term. My worries about automation surprise Another problem, maybe a short-mid term problem, I can see with using LLMs for doing RCAs is the automation surprise problem. Automation surprise occurs when an automated system behaves in an unexpected way, catching users off guard. This often happens because users don't fully understand how the automation works or the range of possible outcomes the system might produce. For example, in aviation, pilots might experience automation surprise if an autopilot system suddenly changes the aircraft's behavior due to a mode switch they didn't anticipate. This can lead to confusion, reduced situational awareness, and potentially dangerous situations if the users cannot quickly understand and correct the system's actions. This highlights the importance of designing automated systems that are predictable and providing adequate training so users are aware of the system's capabilities and limitations. LLMs are prone to hallucination problems. After some initial success with RCA, people might start placing more trust in LLMs and build some automation around their decisions. They would then be in for a big surprise when things go awry, and they can't figure out the problem. The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair. -- Douglas Adams Some LLM news from AWS This bit of news is making the rounds. AWS seems to have integrated Amazon Q, their GenAI assistant for software development, into their internal systems and applied it to Java 17 upgrades of their systems: \"The average time to upgrade an application to Java 17 plummeted from what’s typically 50 developer-days to just a few hours. We estimate this has saved us the equivalent of 4,500 developer-years of work (yes, that number is crazy but, real).\" I am fazed that there is not even a single negative comment under this announcement. Could this maybe go wrong? When I was at AWS, I saw first-hand the excellent operational culture there. The weekly operational meeting (was that on Wednesday) was really instructional in terms of learning the thought processes of these safety/security/availability expert engineers. The correct mindset to apply here is a paranoid mindset, and to scrutinize everything, and even be wary of success. It would be a shame if this culture erodes due to some early success with using LLMs to update software. OK, so let's revisit that question. What could go wrong with LLMs making the upgrade to Java 17? I will speculate, because I don't know much about this problem. I can see some operational problems. If we put people to do this work, maybe while doing this on certain packages, they will notice, \"oh shit, we never thought of this problem, but for these type of packages, upgrading them to be Java 17 compliant might open these security problems\". We may be losing this opportunity with engineers goin in the field, getting their hands dirty, and discovering certain problematic cases. Another problem I mentioned above is that maybe we are failing to train new engineers for operational challenges. I am not suggesting a Butlerian Jihad against LLMs. But I am worried, we are enticed too much by LLMs. Ok, let's use them, but maybe we shouldn't open the fort doors to let them in. AI aws Comments Anonymous said… I find kind of funny how everyone is wowed by LLMs.... except in their own field - where they can't be reliable nor insightful. August 24, 2024 at 9:45 PM wimaxapp said… One of the key areas I have been working in AIOps! In my first projects on Kubernetes events RCA, LLM based troubleshooting and RCA does work well depending on how we prepare the data ,prompts and the model. Distributed system RCA is more complex ,it requires a careful data modeling and prompt engineering depending on the scenario. There are still some challenges. But powerful, large context LLMs are enabling to deal with data complexities to an extent. August 24, 2024 at 10:59 PM Anonymous said… > \"The average time to upgrade an application to Java 17 plummeted from what’s typically 50 developer-days to just a few hours.\" *blink* ...why are they boasting about migrating to Java 17... in 2024? ...and from what versions were they migrating from? Java 17 didn't introduce any significant breaking-changes (IME) for users on Java 16 or even the next previous LTS version, Java 11 - I don't work at Amazon, but surely Amazon isn't in the habit of running on unsupported JVMs? - so assuming these Java projects were being competently maintained, then the only work actually required to migrate to 17 is changing your `org.gradle.java.home=` path to where JDK 17 followed by running your test suite. If Amazon was using a monorepo then 1 person could do this in 5 minutes with a 1-liner awk/sed command - it would actually take an AI far longer to do this given LLMs don't (yet) have read/write access to my git repo SSD, and they'd probably want to re-evaluate the prompt for each project file. The \"50 days\" number he gives, without any context either, is a nice shorthand to communicate his utter disconnection from what really goes-on inside his org. In conclusion: these remarks by leadership unintentionally make the company look bad, not good, once you fill-in-the-blanks to make up for what they dind't say. (What's next...? Big Brother increasing our chocolate ration to 20 grammes per week?) ----- One more thing: the comment-replies to the post are utterly derranged and I genuinely can't put my sense of unease into words.

LLMs are good at predicting the next word in written language. They are generative; they make new text given a prompt. LLMs do not have base sets of facts about how complex systems work, and do not attempt to reason over a corpus of evidence and facts. as a result, I would expect that an LLM might concoct an interesting story about why such a failure occurred, and it might even be a convincing story if it happened to weave bits of context, accurately into the storyline. It might even, purely randomly, generate a story that actually correctly diagnosed the root cause of the failure, but that would be coincidental based on the similarity of the prompt to text of similar postmortem discussions that were part of its training set. If you had an extremely detailed postmortem document, then I would expect LLM‘s to do a very good job of summarizing such document. But I don’t see why an LLM is an appropriate tool for analyzing failures in complex systems; just as I don’t see a hammer being a very effective tool for tightening bolts. Right now, I am concerned that the relative ease that modern frameworks provide to author LLM based applications, is leading many people to optimistically include LLM technology in attempts to solve problems that it doesn’t seem particularly well suited to solve. reply reissbaker 6 hours agoparentTBQH I'd bet the following would yield pretty good results: 1. Take your existing incident reporting / review docs (you have those, right?) that cover everything including 5-why incident reporting and analysis. 2. Fine-tune a Llama-3.1-70b [1] LoRA on the data associated with the outage as input, and the root cause analysis as the output 3. Tada! You have a state-of-the-art custom LLM that is good at analyzing your outages and guessing what the root causes might be. It's a little shocking sometimes to me how underutilized fine-tuning is. Most of the \"learning\" happening in \"machine learning\" is in training — yes, it's definitely true that LLMs can exhibit a surprising amount of \"in-context learning\" via prompts, but it's a surprising because learning during training is so much more powerful, and it's surprising that in-context works at all. Honestly even just fine-tuning an 8b model — which is totally doable on a 3090/4090 — can yield SOTA results on task-specific performance. It's so much better than prompting! 1: I mean you could also finetune 405b, but you'll need a lot of GPUs both to train it and to run it. In my experience (public benchmarks be damned; the models all tend to saturate the public benchmarks, even though everyone claims not to train on them), 70b on internal evals tends to perform similarly to gpt-4o, and with OSS models you have somewhat more ownership and control. reply lkrubner 1 hour agorootparentThis strategy amounts to building a RAG for your company. I have a friend who is CTO at a startup and he is doing exactly this. He has uploaded every document he can to Anthropic/Claude, using their service which allows easy construction of RAGs. He has uploaded thousands of documents. And now he can ask it questions like, \"Which will increase profits more, hiring another engineer, or hiring another sales person?\" I think we will see more of this. There are some big privacy concerns, but \"an internal RAG for every business\" will probably find some customers. reply williamcotton 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's a little shocking sometimes to me how underutilized fine-tuning is. I imagine it is because of the costs of building a dataset. reply Infinity315 5 hours agorootparentprevI take issue with this. Typically issues arise because they are novel and are unforeseen. If we did see these issues beforehand they'd be fixed! LLMs by definition are trained by example, so I fail to see how finetuning LLMs on things that have already happened to be helpful for determining the root cause of a novel issue. LLMs seem to lack systemic modelling that humans do. I can see LLMs being practical for this if it is shown that LLMs are capable of modelling scenarios outside of their dataset, but thus far none such examples exist. reply reissbaker 5 hours agorootparentDuring my time taking on-call pager rotations at fairly large engineering organizations, I'd say that a distressingly large number of incidents happened for fairly standard reasons (\"didn't write tests for this case\" + \"deployed\" + \"insufficient monitoring,\" with things like incorrect concurrency assumptions around DB access, or memory leaks in application code, or insufficient rate limiting / circuitbreaking causing cascading failures being fairly common passengers). In fact, it's actually pretty hard for me to come up with an issue that wasn't basically a fairly common programming error combined with some relatively common infrastructure, build, test, and/or observability problem. Sometimes with some common bureaucratic human problems thrown into the mix too, i.e. \"no one owns this service's uptime.\" reply Infinity315 4 hours agorootparentI think we're at an epistemic impasse here. At what point would/could you be convinced that LLMs are incapable or unsuited here? If LLMs were successfully deployed in a production environment is the day I bite my tongue. What about you? I'm not even sure that LLMs are even capable of solving standard bugs see: [1]. Hallucination seems to be a significant hurdle and any time spent validating the fixes of an LLM is wasted when it could be spent tackling the bug head on.

This shows so much faith in management! reply Infinity315 4 hours agorootparentAlright, fine. Maybe you don't have faith in management, but perhaps you do have faith in the open market and capitalism. Feel free to point out any error in my logic: There are huge financial incentives--tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars--for developing an LLM which can solve novel bugs. So surely there exists AI companies developing an LLM capable of doing so. If an LLM capable of solving novel bugs exists, AI companies would rush to showing it off to capture tonnes of VC money. AI companies could show off their fancy bug-fixing LLM by closing issues on public Github repos using said LLMs. No such mythical LLM exists. We are thus left with two choices: 1. My logic is flawed or there is an alternative possibility I haven't considered. 2. The LLM capable of doing what OP asserts doesn't exist and can't be made, despite their assertion that it is trivial to fine tune and put into application. reply exe34 2 hours agorootparentMy point was that management has a history of rolling out shiny things to production and then having egg on their face.

In my experience, LLMs are word predictors, and the impacts of that fact are not immediately obvious. LLMs are capable of \"explaining\" what code does. What it is doing under the hood is pattern matching: I've seen code that looks like X, with an explanation that looks like Y LLMs are capable of formatting text. It has seen English written like X, that is reformatted to look like Y One resounding fact my team has found over and over is that \"the things we think are hard for LLMs aren't necessarily hard; the things we think are easy aren't necessarily easy\" reply dTal 3 hours agorootparentWorth noting that pattern matching and term rewriting are a sufficiently general combination that it forms the basis for Mathematica. reply psb217 2 hours agorootparentTrouble sneaks in when the pattern matching is only correct most of the time. Eg, if some code for regex-based search missed anywhere from 0.1% to 10% of matches, with the miss rate depending on the regex and no obvious way to know which regexes have worse miss rates, the utility of your regex-based search would be limited. LLMs are like this, but their generality makes them useful in spite of this limitation. reply 60654 2 hours agorootparentprevI would just add that Mathematica-style term rewriting (e.g. analytical integration, or equation solving) is done with _semantics-preserving_ symbolic solvers, which are hand-made and human-reviewed to guarantee correctness.

LLMs are good at predicting the next word in written language. They are generative; they make new text given a prompt. Now explain what humans are doing and why it is different. RCA can be done fully remotely, so we know it can be modelled as a word-prediction model with context and a \"how is all this context made consistent?\" prompt. There is every reason to expect that an advanced text prediction model would be excellent at predicting the most-technically-correct response to that prompt. I've seen a few people make this argument as though text prediction is some specific sub-field that can be solved independently of having a world model and intelligence. That doesn't hold up at all, if we solve text prediction we've solved general intelligence - all aspects of human intelligence are less complex than being able to predict the most objectively correct next word in a sequence of words because all aspects of intelligence can be framed as a text-prediction problem. A system can't predict the next word in a sequence and fool a human without being at least as clever as a human. reply crystal_revenge 13 hours agorootparentYou don't even have to get deep into the internals of LLMs to see what's wrong with your reasoning. The problem lies with the basic mechanics of: > predict the most objectively correct next word in a sequence of words Currently all LLMs are only determining the most probable next token, but this means they are not aware of the probability of the entire sequence of tokens they are emitting. That is, they can only build sentences by picking the most probable next word, but can never choose the most probable sentence. In practice, there are a great many very likely sentences that are composed of a fairly unlikely words. When we use the output of an LLM we're thinking it of a sequence sampled from the set of all possible sequences, but that's not really what we're getting (at least as far as probability is concerned). There are approaches to address this: you can do multinomial sampling instead of greedy so that are casting a slightly large net or you can do beam search where your once again trying to search a broader set of possible sentences choosing by the most probable sequence. But all of these are fairly limited. Which gets to your first remark: > Now explain what humans are doing and why it is different. There's very little we really know about how humans reason, but we are certainly building linguistic expressions at with a more abstract form of composition. This comment for example was planned out in parts, not even sequentially, and then reworked to the whole thing makes some sense. But at the very least humans are clearly reasoning at the level of entire sequences as their probability rather than individual tokens at a time. The word \"planning\" almost tautologically implies thinking ahead of the next step. When humans write HN comments or code they're clearly planning rather than just thinking of the next most likely word over and over again with some noise to make it sound more interesting. No matter how powerful and sophisticated the mathematical models driving the core of LLMs are, we're fundamentally limited by the methods we use to sample from them. reply ithkuil 8 hours agorootparentIn order to produce the next sentence you have to produce the next word first and then the word after it and so on. Before the model arrives at the candidates for the next word it first computes vectors in high dimensional space that combine every combination of words in the context and extract semantics from it. When producing the next token the model effectively has already \"decided\" the direction where the answer will go and that is encoded as a high dimensional vector before being reduced to the next token (and the process repeated) reply Jensson 1 hour agorootparent> When producing the next token the model effectively has already \"decided\" the direction where the answer will go No it hasn't, if you tell it to write a random story and it starts with \"A\", it hasn't figured out what the next word should be, and you run it many times from that \"A\" you will get many different sentences. It will do some adapting to future possibilities, but it doesn't calculate the sentence once like you suggest it will, it comes up with a new sentence for every token it generates. reply hansvm 5 hours agorootparentprev> Currently all LLMs are only determining the most probable next token, but this means they are not aware of the probability of the entire sequence of tokens they are emitting. That is, they can only build sentences by picking the most probable next word, but can never choose the most probable sentence They're normally trained to output a probability distribution for the next token and _sample_ from that distribution. Doing so iteratively, if you work through the conditional probabilities, samples from the distribution of completed prompts (or similarly if you want to stop at a single sentence) with the same distribution as the base training data. You're right that you can't pick the most likely sentence in general, but if there exists a sentence likely enough for you to care then you can just repeat the prompt a few times and take the most common output, adjusting the repetition count in line with your desired probability of failure. Most prompts don't have a \"most likely\" sentence for you to care about though. If you ask for meal suggestions with some context, you almost certainly want a different response each time, and the thing that matters is that the distribution of those responses is \"good.\" LLMs, by design, can accomplish that so long as the training data has enough information and the task requires at most a small, bounded amount of computation. reply roenxi 12 hours agorootparentprevThat doesn't hold together. You seem to be arguing that LLMs produce text as a sequence of words. Which, fair enough, they obviously do. But then your argument seems to drift into humans not producing text as a series of words. I'm not sure how you type your comments but you should upload a YouTube video of it as it sounds like it'd be quite a spectacle!

Do you write the middle of the sentence first, come back to the start then finish it? Or do you have a special keyboard where you drop sentences as fully formed input? As systems humans and LLMs behave in observably similar ways. You feed in some sort of prompt+context, there is a little bit of thinking done, a response is developed by some wildly black-box method, and then a series of words are generated as output. The major difference is that the black boxes presumably work differently but since they are both black boxes that doesn't matter much for which will do a better job at root cause analysis.

They are generative; they make new text given a prompt. LLMs do not have base sets of facts about how complex systems work, and do not attempt to reason over a corpus of evidence and facts. Not wanting to advocate for using LLMs for RCA, which is a dumb and dangerous idea for all the reasons the OP mentioned - but I am getting allergic to the phrase \"it just predicts the next word\". Yes, that is how the \"API\" of an LLM works, but on itself, it says nothing about how the LLM does the prediction and how complex the internal model is that it uses for that task. It's obvious that the task of predicting has a huge variance in complexity, depending on which word has to be predicted. E.g. the sentence \"The apple does not fall far from the\" could be completed by a decently trained Markov chain, whereas (correctly!) completing \"sqrt(153847)=\" would either require an impossibly large training set or an internal model that can parse integers and perform square root calculations. Yet both are on the surface \"predict the next word\" tasks. The actual complexity of LLMs' internal models seems to still be poorly understood. That's not to say the model has superhuman ability or even reaches human abilities. But the point is that it's still really hard to make predictions how complex the reasoning is that an LLM performs for a task. In the OP's example, we can't really say if the LLM \"has base sets of facts about how complex systems work\", because we don't really know if and how \"facts\" would be represented inside the model. If enough in-domain examples were in the trainset, there is no fundamental reason why it wouldn't have learned such a set of facts. Just saying \"it can't reason at all because it's just a next word predictor\" is mixing up different layers of meaning and, I believe, does not lead to more insight. reply refulgentis 14 hours agoparentprevYou're way over-estimating the \"it only knows the training data\" stuff to a very large degree.

There was a task that I thought that it was quite possible for an LLM to be good at. The task was such that we could run a bit of a ‘study’ to see how the LLM fared against a real-world meat-bag person. A skilled person at that. The person we would’ve had do the job in the first place. The LLM and the human agreed the vast majority of the time (>99.9%), and the LLM with its infinite ‘attention’ (heh) was on more than one occasion correct in cases where the human wasn’t, because it was a repetitive task that’d put someone to sleep. It was a task that involved parsing language, but I’m sure one that the geniuses on HN would say requires “understanding semantics”, “intelligence” or whatever armchair philosophy nonsense they whip out in lieu of intelligent conversation. It wasn’t sentiment analysis, categorisation, or anything of that nature. Maybe it’s something I could’ve tackled without an LLM, with traditional ‘deep learning’, or whatever. I really don’t know.

Java 17 didn't introduce any significant breaking-changes (IME) for users on Java 16 or even the next previous LTS version, Java 11 - I don't work at Amazon, but surely Amazon isn't in the habit of running on unsupported JVMs? - so assuming these Java projects were being competently maintained, then the only work actually required to migrate to 17 is changing your `org.gradle.java.home=` path to where JDK 17 followed by running your test suite. If Amazon was using a monorepo then 1 person could do this in 5 minutes with a 1-liner awk/sed command - whereas I expect it would likely take an AI far longer to do this, if it's even able to make sense of an Amazon-sized monorepo - they'd also likely re-prompt it for every separate project for reliability's sake.

Let me explain how this happens in real life instead of breathless C-type hucksterism: We have a project working on very large code-base in .NET Web Forms (and other old tech) that needs be updated to more modern tech so it can be in .NET 8 and run on linux to save hosting costs. I realize this is more complicated that just convert to later versions of Java, but it's roughly the same idea. The original estimate was for 5 devs for 5 years. C-types decide it's time to use LLMs to help this get done. We use both Co-Pilot and later others, Claude of which turned out to be the most useful. Senior devs create processes that offshore teams start using to convert code. Target tech can be varied based on updated requirements, so some went to Razor pages, some to JS with .NET API, some other stuff. Looks to be pretty good modernization at the start. Then the Senior devs start trying to vet the changes. This turns out to be a monumental undertaking. Literally swamped code reviewing output from the offshore teams. Many, many subtle bugs were introduced. It was noted that the bugs were from the LLMs, not the offshore team. A very real fatigue sets in among senior devs where all they're doing is vetting machine generate code. I can't tell you how mind numbing this becomes. You start to use the LLMs to help review, which seems good but really compounds the problem. Due to the time this is taking, some parts of the code start to be vetted by just the offshore team, and only the \"important things\" get reviewed by Senior devs. This works fine for exactly 5 weeks after the first live deploy. At that point the live system experiences a major meltdown and causes an outage affecting a large number of customers. All hands on deck, trying to find the problem. Days go by, system limps along on restarts and patches, until the actual primary culprit is found, which turns out to be a == for some reason being turned into a != in a particular gnarly set of boolean logic. There were other problems as well, but that particular one wreaked the most havoc. Now they're back to formal, very careful code reviews, and I moved onto a different project on threat of leaving. If this is the future of programming, it's going to be a royal slog. reply wbogusz 16 hours agoparentprev> Here’s a simple rule, based on the fact no one has shown that an llm or a compound llm system can produce an output that doesn’t need to be verified for correctness by a human across any input: I’m still not sure why some of us are so convinced there isn’t an answer to properly verifying LLM output. In so many circumstances, having output pushed 90-95% of the way is very easily pushed to 100% by topping off with a deterministic system. Do I depend on an LLM to perform 8 digit multiplication? Absolutely not, because like you say, I can’t verify the correctness that would drive the statistics of whatever answer it spits out. But why can’t I ask an LLM to write the python code to perform the same calculation and read me its output? > I think it follows that we should not use llms for anything critical. While we are at it I think we should also institute an IQ threshold for employees to contribute to or operate around critical systems. If we can’t be sure to an absolute degree that they will not make a mistake, then there is no purpose to using them. All of their work will simply need to be double checked and verified anyway. reply sickblastoise 15 hours agorootparentThere isn’t one answer to how to do it. If you have an answer to validation for your specific use case, go for it. this is not trivial because most flashy things people want to use llms for like code generation and automated RCA’s are hard or impossible to verify without the I Need A More Intelligent Model problem. 2. I believe this is falsely equating what llms do with human intelligence. There is a skill threshhold for interacting with critical systems, for humans it comes down to “will they screw this up?” And the human can do it because humans are generally intelligent. The human can make good decisions to predict and handle potential failure modes because of this. reply latentnumber 17 hours agoparentprevWhy not automate verification itself then? While not possible now, and I would probably never advocate for using LLMs in critical settings, it might be possible to build field-specific verification systems for LLMs with robustness guarantees as well. reply RodgerTheGreat 17 hours agorootparentIf the verification systems for LLMs are built out of LLMs, you haven't addressed the problem at all, just hand-waved a homunculus that itself requires verification. If the verification systems for LLMs are not built out of LLMs and they're somehow more robust than LLMs at human-language problem solving and analysis, then you should be using the technology the verification system uses instead of LLMs in the first place! reply wbogusz 16 hours agorootparent> If the verification systems for LLMs are not built out of LLMs and they're somehow more robust than LLMs at human-language problem solving and analysis, then you should be using the technology the verification system uses instead of LLMs in the first place! The issue is not in the verification system, but in putting quantifiable bounds on your answer set. If I ask an LLM to multiply large numbers together I can also very easily verify the generated answer by topping it with a deterministic function. I.e. rather than hoping that an LLM can accurately multiply two 10 digit numbers, I have a much easier (and verified) solution by instead asking it to perform this calculation using python and reading me the output reply sickblastoise 17 hours agorootparentprevSpitballing, if you had a digital model of a commercial airplane, you could have an llm write all of the component code for the flight system, then iteratively test the digital model under all possible real world circumstances. I think automating verification generally might require general intelligence, not an expert though. reply llm_trw 16 hours agoparentprevThe same is true of computers, in fact it has been mathematically proven that it is impossible to answer the general question if a computer program is correct. But that hasn't stopped the last 40 years from happening because computers made fewer mistakes than the next best alternative. The same needs to be true of LLMs. reply mrcode007 16 hours agorootparentThe theory you’re alluding to says it is impossible to create a general algorithm that decides any non-trivial property of any computer program. There is nothing in the theory that prevents you creating a program that verifies a particular specific program. There is an entire field dedicated to doing just that. reply llm_trw 16 hours agorootparentThe issue is there to verify a program you need to have a spec. To generate a spec you need to solve the general problem. This is what gets swept under the rug whenever formal methods are brought up. reply mrcode007 14 hours agorootparentThat is not true at all. You do not need to generate a spec. All you need to do is prove a property. This can be done in many ways. For example, many things can be proven about the following program without having to solve any general problem at all: echo “hello world” Similarly for quick sort, merge sort, and all sort of things.

The colour. reply thiht 9 hours agoparentI can’t believe a mostly text website that doesn’t scale well on mobile made it to production in this day and age. Was it worked on by a single person? Did no one review it and think of opening it on their mobile? I’d even say it’s harder to make a text website NOT render well on mobile. Doesn’t HTML handle that by default, unless you use some freakishly long text without spaces? reply phoronixrly 8 hours agorootparentNot every website's key metric is conversion of mobile users. I have never needed to read Ruby documentation on my phone. I'm glad they did not waste their time on unimportant stuff like mobile UX in this case. reply thiht 7 hours agorootparentI doubt you’re the only user of the Ruby documentation though. I’m not a (frequent) Ruby user, but I routinely check the Go documentation, the MDN, the Python documentation, and several other language documentations on mobile. Because sometimes I will think of something while I’m walking my dog, or while I’m in my couch, or before sleeping, or at any other moment. Mobile UX is exactly as important as desktop UX. And for a text only website (ie. not a web app) you don’t even need to spend time to make it work, it’s almost the default behavior. You have to go out of your way to make a text website that doesn’t render well on mobile. reply oefrha 7 hours agorootparentprevWaste time? I can make a one line change to make it basically good enough on mobile: - main { max-width: 800px; } + main { box-sizing: border-box; max-width: min(864px, 100%); } There. Anyone who thinks that's a waste of time probably shouldn't be allowed to touch the CSS of a high traffic website. reply bollu 5 hours agorootparentNice! As someone who understands very little CSS, could you explain why this works? reply thaumasiotes 4 hours agorootparentI can't tell why it works, but I can talk about some general things I see. First, I assume the problem is that, when viewed on mobile, this website is wider than the screen. (Or wider than the browser window.) This makes some horizontal scrolling necessary in order to read some of the text. No matter how narrow I make the browser window on a desktop, the same problem never occurs, so at first glance this looks like a bug in the mobile browser (which for me is Firefox Focus). The `box-sizing` CSS property determines whether you want the size of an element to be set to the value you specify, or to something else. You might ask \"why would I want something else?\", and that's a good question. Anyway, `box-sizing: border-box` means that when you set the width of the element, it won't be any wider than the width that you set. The default value of this setting is `content-box`, which means that the \"content\" of the element won't be any wider than the width you set, but, if the element itself uses any padding or borders, those don't count toward the width and the element will be wider than you said it should be. I assume the adjustment to `max-width` is intended to do two things: (1) prevent the width of the element from exceeding 100%, presumably related to the width of the browser window; (2) otherwise, raise the previous maximum by 64px, to adjust for the fact that padding is now included in the notional width of the element. There was probably 64px worth of padding originally. The problems I see in my own analysis are: (a) We're only adjusting the `max-width` property, which means that if an element wants to be narrower for other reasons, such as the width of the browser window, that was always allowed. It's not clear to me why this wouldn't have been happening in the page as delivered. (b) As I mentioned above, the problem that occurs on mobile does not ever occur on desktop, no matter how narrow the browser window gets. This suggests that it isn't a problem with the CSS, but rather with the mobile browser. reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentprevI find myself reading technical docs on my phone all the time. I'm often out on a walk or shopping or whatever while thinking over a plan for a project, and when I have an idea that seems like it'd work I'll go look at the docs to make sure I'm not missing something.

Bad look either way. reply tapanih 10 hours agoprevI like the new code blocks more! The syntax highlighting is more standard. I found the red comments on a grey background difficult to read in the old theme. However, I would still want to see higher contrast in the text. It looks like the mobile view is getting fixed [1]. [1] https://github.com/ruby/rdoc/pull/1162 reply strzibny 15 hours agoprevOh no, much prefered the old look. And why the hell green? Ruby's not Python :( reply pentestercrab 10 hours agoparentI have to agree with you. It is a shame the classic style isn’t available at an alternate subdomain or directory. Has anyone tried rendering the current docs with the old theme? reply yumraj 12 hours agoparentprev> Ruby's not Python :( You mean Ruby's not Emerald ;) reply pyinstallwoes 13 hours agoparentprevYeah that’s weird reply Alifatisk 8 hours agoprevSo what alternatives is there to the official docs? ruby-docs.org is sadly gone https://web.archive.org/web/20230615061406/https://www.ruby-... There is https://rubyapi.org and https://ruby-doc.org left from what I know reply ljm 6 hours agoparentAnything except ApiDock which always seems to take precedence in Google over the official documentation (albeit for Rails) and is almost never what you’re looking for. reply derencius 5 hours agoparentprevI've been using devdocs.io for ruby and rails api docs. reply porgarmer 12 hours agoprev- Why is this dark green? - Its very hard to navigate around and easy to get lost with links. - Mobile view is borderline unusable. Need to scroll horizontally to read a sentence. - Cursor is a beam while hovering over the sandwich menu icon reply pmdr 4 hours agoprevNot the best redesign, but probably the most upvotes and comments on a Ruby related post lately, so yay? reply lawgimenez 10 hours agoprevThe font is not good for my bad eyesight with severe astigmatism. reply Archelaos 10 hours agoparentIt is generally hard to read, even with only mild astigmatism and perfect glasses. What is even worth is that the Website does not appear to support Firefox's readability mode. That seems to be the curse of our time: Function follows form. reply Corrado 6 hours agorootparentI use Firefox's readability mode for quite a lot to help me process these \"pretty\" web pages. Most of the time it works pretty well and I can read the content even faster. Even if it doesn't work perfectly, it still provides a better contrast than the original. In the case of these new Ruby docs, it falls apart more completely than I've ever seen. It's completely unusable! As a terrible Ruby programmer with pretty good 55 year old eyes I can't read these docs at all. Everyone is complaining about the color scheme (which I agree with) but its the font choices (lightweight, grey on grey) that kills usability for me. When I'm looking at docs I need to find what I need quickly, and searching a sea of whitespace and barely there text is not great. reply Taig 8 hours agoprevThere is a lot wrong here. But my favorite messed up detail is how my cursor changes to text mode when I hover the hamburger button on the top left. reply thiht 6 hours agoparentThe cursor also switches to \"pointer\" (the hand) for no reason on the documentation pages, eg. here: https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/String.html#method-i-ri... reply mkl95 9 hours agoprevI remember this kind of UX being prevalent in the early 2010s or so. Fortunately most docs have moved on. reply elif 7 hours agoprevThis reminds me of all the times a manager asked if I (backend dev) could 'just do a little interface for xyz' Like what do you expect from me? I would be rendering these docs in a w3 emacs frame... reply biql 10 hours agoprevSadly, the typography looks too neglected for the time when there is such an abundance of templates and fonts. reply matteason 7 hours agoprevIs the font rendering any better on other platforms? On Windows it's so poorly hinted that the top and bottom of the lowercase 's' are disconnected reply 3np 12 hours agoprevTwo regressions I noted right away (chromium): - CPU usage and rendering overhead/waiting time is noticably higher than on the old version. - The supposedly responsive functionality means that the sidebar hides ~half of main content on my default window size and resolution on desktop. I have to zoom out to be able to read at all. reply yunwal 4 hours agoprevUp there with Tropicana and Gap for senseless rebrands reply nilslindemann 7 hours agoprev* Ugly font rendering * Underscores in page names * No 'next' and 'prev' buttons. When that is done it should be a good start. reply alabhyajindal 5 hours agoprevLooks terrible. Very sad. reply pawelduda 7 hours agoprevDon't like it, don't know what problems it was supposed to solve reply flufluflufluffy 2 hours agoprevThe vomit-green color is my favorite part. Like, they didn’t even try for a forest-green, or lime-green, nope. went straight for vomit reply rootedbox 11 hours agoprevDoesn’t work on mobile - sent from my iPhone reply usernamed7 4 hours agoprevWhy is it green? It shouldn't be green. Ruby docs should be red. If i stumbled onto this site while looking for docs about a ruby method, i'd think I landed on the docs for some other programming language or fork of ruby. That's how off-brand this is - to the point of being disorienting as a user. There are not a lot of things that create a brand around a programming language, and color is definitely one of them. This is such a tasteless design decision for something meant to be official ruby documentation that I can't even appreciate any other changes that docs may introduce. And then the fact that it doesn't even work on mobile... I am truly baffled anyone would think this is in good taste. the last time I saw such a fumble with ruby related docs was back around 2014 when relishapp was the only place to get rspec docs. It's UX was such a painful mess that i just avoided it at all costs. Glad to see it's dead now. reply cute_boi 5 hours agoprevThey should probably get idea from Laravel docs. reply baggy_trough 12 hours agoprevThat's nice, but what I'd like is if I type the name of a major class, like \"File\", that the File class be on top, not some obscure method/module that contains \"File\" as a substring. reply ilikepi 11 hours agoparentThe search issue is also present with the docs for Ruby 3.3[1] and earlier. Incidentally, \"String\" is an even better example, as the the class is the fifth result returned after four other very obscure classes. [1]: https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.3/ reply baggy_trough 10 hours agorootparentI'd love to know where that ordering comes from. Insanity! reply Themainfn 10 hours agoprevthe font looks stuck at 99% reply aa_is_op 10 hours agoprevIt's called Ruby, but the color theme is green. Hilarious! reply stevenfoster 13 hours agoprevBig nope. reply dudeinjapan 11 hours agoprevThe main font color for Ruby is... green? reply wiseowise 11 hours agoprevNot optimized for mobile in 2024, seriously? reply marginalia_nu 10 hours agoparentGiven how technical documentation is typically used, when would you view it on a mobile device? reply orhmeh09 9 hours agorootparentExtremely often. I look at source code, API docs, issues, etc. on my phone all the time when I am on the bus or in the bathroom or in bed or wherever. reply jacamera 7 hours agoprev [–] No dark mode?
