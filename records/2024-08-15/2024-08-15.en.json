Even the homepage doesn't load. We've had recurrent issues with Actions not running, but this seems a lot bigger. The status page says all is well, though: https://www.githubstatus.com/. Hilarious. reply karmakaze 19 hours agoparentI get the angry unicorn page \"No server is currently available to service your request. Sorry about that.

Contact Support — GitHub Status — @githubstatus\" with that last link going to https://x.com/githubstatus showing \"GitHub Status Oct 22, 2018 Everything operating normally.\" reply kalkin 19 hours agorootparentI think this is because logged-out Twitter now shows top Tweets of all time from a user, rather than most recent Tweets. Good reason why companies shouldn't be using Twitter/X for status updates anymore! reply xp84 19 hours agorootparentThank you! I was wondering why all I could see was useless content there! reply gamer191 19 hours agorootparentUse https://xcancel.com/ (eg https://xcancel.com/githubstatus) reply TwiztidK 19 hours agorootparentprevThe era of Twitter/X status pages needs to come to an end given how unusable it is if you aren't logged in. reply blt 13 hours agorootparentMaking logins required to view twitter was the ultimate bed shitting move. The whole point of twitter was to be a broadcast medium. Tweets were viewable without following or logging in. There is a huge vacuum in that space now. reply raxxorraxor 11 hours agorootparentFor most (social media) platforms really. Management believes it would force users to sign up, but in reality the platform just becomes less relevant because of that limitation. Not even talking about search crawlers. An all around stupid decision. That said, if management is that shitty, the platform probably won't be attractive for long anyway. Facebook/Instagram were successful despite that to a degree, but this decision probably still did a lot of damage to their relevancy and user numbers. reply disgruntledphd2 11 hours agorootparent> Facebook/Instagram were successful despite that to a degree, but this decision probably still did a lot of damage to their relevancy and user numbers. FB/IG/Whatsapp have half of humanity logging into their services once per month, so I'm not sure how much better they could be doing if they didn't have a login wall. Meanwhile, Twitter (with no login wall) never broke 500mn. Like, personally I totally take your point about status updates but I'd have used my Twitter account a lot more if I'd needed to log in to see the content. reply temp0826 18 hours agoparentprevUsed to work ops at AWS. I don't know if it's still the case but it required VERY HIGH management approval to actually flip any lights on their \"status page\" (likely it was referenced in some way for SLAs and refunding customers). reply smsm42 18 hours agorootparentThat is an excellent illustration to Goodhart's law. We're going to have this avesome status page, but since if we update it the clients would notice the system is down, we're going to put a lot of barriers to putting the actual status on that page. Also probably a class action suit lurking somewhere in there eventually. reply purkka 19 hours agoparentprevI have to wonder how a company at the scale of GitHub can be so bad at keeping track of their status. Now 4 out of 10 services are marked as \"Incident\", yet most of the others are also completely dead. reply xuancanh 19 hours agorootparentIt's because of the way most companies build their status dashboards. There are usually at least 2 dashboards, one internal dashboard and one external dashboard. The internal dashboard is the actual monitoring dashboard, where it will be hooked up with other monitoring data sources. The external status dashboard is just for customer communication. Only after the outage/degradation is confirmed internally, then the external dashboard will be updated to avoid flaky monitors and alerts. It will also affect SLAs so it needs multiple levels of approval to change the status, that's why there are some delays. reply ParetoOptimal 19 hours agorootparent> The external status dashboard is just for customer communication. Only after the outage/degradation is confirmed internally, then the external dashboard will be updated to avoid flaky monitors and alerts. It will also affect SLAs so it needs multiple levels of approval to change the status, that's why there are some delays. This defeats the purpose of a status dashboard and is effectively useless in practice most of the time from a consumers point of view. reply consteval 5 hours agorootparentFrom a business perspective, I think given the choice to lie a little bit or be brutally honest with your customers, lying a bit is almost always the correct choice. reply ParetoOptimal 2 hours agorootparentMy ideal would be if regulations which made it necessary that downtime metrics had to be reported with at most somewhere between a 10m and 30m delay as \"suspected reliability issue\". If your reliability metrics have lots of false positives, that's on you and you'll have to write down some reason why those false positives exist every time. Then that company could decide for itself whether to update manually with \"not a reliability issue because X\". This lets consumers avoid being gaslighted and businesses don't technically have to call it downtime. reply insane_dreamer 4 hours agorootparentprevLiability is their primary concern reply x86a 19 hours agorootparentprevThis is intentional. It's mostly a matter of discussing how to communicate it publicly and when to flip the switch to start the SLA timer. Also coordinating incident response during a huge outage is always challenging. reply thiagocsf 16 hours agorootparentThat it may be but there’s no excuse. Declare an incident first, investigate later. Cheating SLAs by delaying the incident is a good way to erode trust within and without. reply antimemetics 14 hours agorootparent> Declare an incident first, investigate later. If that would be the best way to deal with it- why is literally no one doing it this way and what does that tell you? reply adgjlsfhk1 13 hours agorootparentbecause it involves admitting that you messed up which companies are often disensentivized to do reply ErikBjare 10 hours agorootparentprevFalse positives? reply Lanedo 19 hours agoparentprevTwitter now has: We are experiencing interruptions in multiple public GitHub services. We suspect the impact is due to a database infrastructure related change that we are working on rolling back. https://x.com/githubstatus/status/1823864449494569023 reply Lanedo 19 hours agoparentprevGithub seems to be coming back up: https://downdetector.com/status/github/ reply kinduff 19 hours agoparentprevThey are flipping the switches now, status page just changed. reply ergocoder 19 hours agoparentprevI wonder why the status just doesn't ping github.com for 200. That seems easy to do. reply bigiain 18 hours agorootparentTo be fair - I really couldn't care less is the homepage is loading or not. So long as I can fetch/commit to my repos, pretty much everything else is of secondary, tertiary, or no real importance to me. (At work, I do indeed have systems running that monitor 200 statuses from client project homepages, almost all of which show better that 99.999% uptimes. And are practically useless. Most of them also monitor \"canary\" API requests which I strive to keep at 99.99% but don't always manage to achieve 99.9% - which is the very best and most expensive SLA we'll commit to.) reply tinyhitman 19 hours agorootparentprevdelaying SLA reply sebmellen 19 hours agorootparentThis is at least a multi-million dollar payout (if they admit to it). All GitHub Pages say > We're having a really bad day. > The Unicorns have taken over. We're doing our best to get them under control and get GitHub back up and running. reply ljahier 19 hours agorootparentAt the moment, all github services seem to be restored, and the github status indicates that the problem is still ongoing. I don't think it's related to the SLA, but rather to the monitoring, which is not live. There are a few minutes of delay. reply cbates 19 hours agorootparentprevSeems slightly unproffesional for a massive company like Github/Microsoft. reply xp84 19 hours agorootparentI disagree. This hurts no one, and not everything needs to be sanitized and painted over with bland corporatespeak. reply COMMENT___ 29 minutes agorootparentThis “ironic” and “humorous” style of errors and UI captions is the actual new corporate speak. I’d prefer dumb error messages rather than some shit someone over the ocean thinks is smart and humorous. And it’s not funny at all when it’s a global outage impacting my business and my $$$. reply majewsky 10 hours agorootparentprevI don't think they were asking for corporate speak. But at least I would find a plain technical error message like \"cannot contact file server\" much more respectable than something like \"unicorns are hugging our servers uwu\". reply colimbarna 19 hours agorootparentprevIt's closer to the truth than you usually get. They're having a bad day, it's completely true. It's the start of my day, but I guess this is the middle of the night for them. There's no such thing as unicorns, but that just highlights the metaphorical nature of the remaining claim - getting Unicorns under control means solving their problems. Normally \"professional\" corporate speak means avoiding saying anything whose meaning is plain on its face and disconfirmable while avoiding the implication that the company is run and operated by humans. This is a model. (Obviously the came up with the message in advance, which just goes to show that someone in the company is well enough rounded to know that if it is displayed, they're having a bad day.) reply wrs 17 hours agorootparentGitHub is (was?) a Rails application, so it was probably originally running behind Unicorn [0], if it isn’t still. So the unicorns are (were) real. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(web_server) reply fragmede 19 hours agorootparentprevfrom where? they don't only have one load balancer, so you'd still have the problem of the page showing green when it's not loading for some folk? reply ergocoder 19 hours agorootparentAt Github's scale, why wouldn't they put a ping monitor from every continent at least? Then, you would show the status based on the continent. reply intelVISA 15 hours agorootparentThat would be self-defeating given that it's a Rails app. reply fragmede 14 hours agorootparentprevWhere on the continent? GitHub is undoubtedly doing blackbox testing internally and has multiple such monitors but that's not going to capture every customer's route to them, leading to the same problem - customers experience GitHub being down, despite monitoring saying it's mostly up. Thus the impass. Even doing whitebox testing, where you know the internals and can this place sensors intelligently, even just for ingress, you're still at the mercy of the Internet. If a sensor that's basically in the same datacenter says you're up, but the route into the datacenter is down, then what? multiply this by the complexity of the whole site, and monitoring it all with 100% fidelity is impossible. Not that it's not worth it to try, there's a team at GitHub that works on monitoring, but beyond motivation about keeping the SLA up, as a customer, unless you notice it's down, is it really down? In a globally distributed system, downtime, except for catastrophic downtime like this, is hard to define on a whole-site basis for all customers. reply laserlight 13 hours agorootparent> 100% fidelity is impossible I don't think anybody asked for 100% fidelity. We are talking about a complete outage that affected at least North America and Europe. If the status page shows green in such a case, its fidelity is around 50%. People expect better from GitHub. reply ergocoder 11 hours agorootparentprev> monitoring it all with 100% fidelity is impossible This is impossible regardless of how godlike the design is... Nobody is asking for 100% fidelity. reply saul-paterson 12 hours agoparentprevFWIW, our self-hosted Gitea instance has not had a single second of unplanned downtime in five years we've been running it. And there wasn't much _planned_ downtime because it's really easy to upgrade (pull a new image and recreate the container — takes out the instance for maybe 15 seconds late at night), and full backups are handled live thanks to zfs. Migration to a new host takes another 15 seconds thanks to both zfs and containers. I don't know how many GitHub downtime reports I've seen during that time, we're probably into high dozens by now. reply chrisallenlane 6 hours agorootparentI've been running Gitea on my homelab for a few months now. It's fantastic. It's like a snapshot of a point in time when GitHub was actually good, before it got enshittified by all of the social and AI nonsense. I've been moving most of my projects off of GitHub and into Gitea, and will continue to do so. reply TacticalCoder 6 hours agoparentprev> I've never seen an outage this big. I remember a time when systems would boast about their \"five nines\" uptime. It was before anything \"cloud\" appeared. reply manquer 19 hours agoparentprevStatus page updates with \"degraded availability\". lol reply rvz 19 hours agoparentprevLooks like we have a full house outage at GitHub with everything down. Much worse than the so-called Twitter / X recent speed-bump that was screeched at and quickly forgotten. I don't think GitHub has recovered from the monthly incidents that keeps occurring. Quite frankly it is the expectation that something will go down every month at GitHub which shows how unreliable the service is and this has happened for years. I guess this 4 year old prediction post really aged well after all about self-hosting and not going all in on Github [0] [0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22868406 reply dataspun 19 hours agorootparentstatute of limitations for HN comment predictions is 3 years. reply RIMR 19 hours agoparentprevWow, the status page only just now started reporting issues, and it still doesn't seem to communicate the scale of the issue. People use this page for guidance. I guess now we know how much it can be trusted. reply ikiris 19 hours agorootparentIt’s used to ease their comms, not a real time status board pointing at their monitoring. reply bitbasher 19 hours agoprevThe timing is pretty uncanny. I just deployed a github page and had a DNS issue because I configured it wrong. I hit \"check again\" and github went down. Hope I don't appear in the incident report. reply sunrunner 19 hours agoparentPerhaps this is a repeat of the Fastly incident with a customer's Varnish cache configuration causing an issue in their systems (I think this is a rough summary, I don't remember the details). So, you're both responsible and not responsible at the same time :) > Hope I don't appear in the incident report. Appearing in an incident report with your HN username could be pretty funny... reply zombot 10 hours agoparentprevSo it was you who crashed GitHub? reply OutOfHere 19 hours agoparentprevFwiw, GitHub Pages is down too. The hosted Pages sites are down. reply red_Seashell_32 19 hours agoparentprevWait. You use github pages for something or actually work on it? reply bitbasher 19 hours agorootparentI use it for something. I had a github page that was public, but it was made private and the DNS config was removed. Fast forward to today. I made the private repo public again and forced a deploy of the page without making a new commit. It said the DNS config was incomplete, so I tweaked it and hit \"check again\" and github went down. Probably unrelated, but the timing was spooky. reply dang 15 hours agorootparentSorry for the offtopicness - would you mind emailing hn@ycombinator.com so I can check in with you about a couple things regarding https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41221186? reply paledot 16 hours agorootparentprevYour domain isn't `null.example.com` or something, is it? reply RIMR 19 hours agoparentprevThis will all clear up when it finishes checking your DNS configuration I bet. reply theovermage 19 hours agoparentprevBad bitbasher bad! :catbonk: reply twp 19 hours agoprevhttps://www.githubstatus.com/ reports no problems, but it's clearly down for a lot of people (including me). reply tabbott 19 hours agoparentIt is kinda amazing how consistently status pages show everything fine during a total outage. It's not that hard to connect a status page to end-to-end monitoring statistics... reply blinded 19 hours agorootparentFrom my experience this requires a few steps happen first: - an incident be declared internally to github - support / incident team submits a new status page entry (with details on service(s) impact(ed)) - incident is worked on internally - incident fixed - page updated - retro posted Even aws now seems to have some automation for their various services per region. But it doesn't automatically show issues because it could be at the customer level or subset of customers, or subset of customers if they are in region foo in AZ bar, on service version zed vs zed - 1. So they chose not to display issues for subsets. I do agree it would be nice to have logins for the status page and then get detailed metrics based on customerid or userid. Someone start a company to compete with statuspage. reply cortesoft 19 hours agorootparentprevThere is always going to be SOME delay between the outage and the status page, although 5 minutes is probably enough time where it should be updated reply thund 19 hours agorootparentafter several minutes the status page is still showing all is fine. For a service like GH, anything more than 30 secs is unacceptable reply x86a 19 hours agorootparentThat is very unrealistic. Infrastructure monitoring at that scale won't even be collecting metrics at that interval. And simple HTTP monitoring would be too flappy for a public status page. reply aeonik 7 hours agorootparentWhat monitoring tools are you using? I know a ton that can do 30 seconds or less at scale. I'm fact, I'm pretty sure all the big players can do that. reply frabjoused 19 hours agorootparentprevIt's simply too soon for the status page to report the anomaly, is my guess. It's been down for 4 minutes. reply thih9 19 hours agorootparent4 minutes is a long time for something that could have been an automated check. For the record, the status page eventually got updated - around 7 minutes after this submission was created. reply owyn 17 hours agorootparentprevOnce in the past I did actually have an incident where the site went down so hard that the tool that we used to update the status page didn't work. We did move it to a totally external and independent service after that. The first service we used was more flaky than our actual site was, so it kept showing the site down when it wasn't. So then we moved to another one, etc. Job security. :) reply beefsack 12 hours agorootparentprevThey say you shouldn't host status pages on the same infrastructure that it is monitoring, but in a way that makes it much more accurate and responsive in outages! reply kredd 19 hours agoparentprevIt went down literally 3 minutes ago (I was in the middle of writing a PR comment), let's see if their cron job kicks in and reports the issue. reply thund 19 hours agorootparentit's starting to show now, about 10 minutes after the issue started reply agosz 19 hours agoparentprevIt's showing a few incidents now. Some things are still green though that don't seem to be working. reply remram 19 hours agoprev@dang https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/kz4khcgdsfdv is probably a better link for this submission now reply pietroppeter 11 hours agoparentI should have looked for this before posting the same comment. Upvoted :) reply erksa 19 hours agoprevThe mobile app on iOS is a 503 with ``` Received a 503 error. Data returned as a String was: I recently looked into using Git in a decentralized way. It's actually pretty easy! Well, that's how it was designed to work! The whole point of Git is that it's a distributed version control system, and doesn't need to rely on a centralized source of truth. reply outworlder 19 hours agorootparentprevI used to work at a company with very draconian policies. Whenever I needed to update some code on a public GitHub repository, I would just push to a remote that was a flash drive. Plug it in my machine at home, pull from that remote, push to origin. I also had to setup a bidirectional mirror back when bandwidth to some countries was restricted. We would push and pull as normal, and a job would keep our mainline in sync. It is sad that most organizations forget that git is distributed by nature. We often get requests to setup VPNs and all sorts of craziness, when a simple push to a bare mirror would suffice. You don't even need anything running, other than SSH. reply __float 17 hours agorootparentDraconian policies...but not security ones? Why were USB drives not blocked? reply mhh__ 18 hours agoparentprevemailing patches is fairly easy. The real reason not to use github anyway though is that it's terrible (the basic \"github model\" for doing code review was basically made up on the back of a napkin IMO) reply katzinsky 16 hours agoparentprevGit without github is pretty much the same as with it. It's just PRs that are different. reply dghlsakjg 19 hours agoprevhttps://www.githubstatus.com/ This is a pretty good place to check. The lag is pretty minimal traditionally.

As soon as it’s ready to serve requests it forks 16 workers. Those workers then select() on the socket, only serving requests they’re capable of handling. In this way the kernel handles the load balancing for us. reply 2YwaZHXV 3 hours agorootparentamazing, thanks! reply unicorner 19 hours agoprevI've never seen such a serious outage before.

That isn’t an excuse for tolerating regular downtime for a site with over 100m+ active users, especially with it running under Microsoft stewardship who should know better. Any other site with that many users and with a horrendous record of downtime like Github would be rightfully branded as unreliable.

That's how git works. reply cropcirclbureau 19 hours agorootparentGithub is more than a remote host for git repositories. It's become one of the major CDNs for software distributions. Github Pages host a majority of static sites that developer use. You won't be able to use Cargo, Nix, Scoop and other package managers right now because their registries have a critical dependency hosted on Github. This is not to mention all the projects that rely on Github for project management, devops, community and support desk.

    "originBody": "HOME > LAW AND POLITICS > After years of legal proceedings, New Zealand Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith has approved Kim Dotcom's extradition to the United States. The Megaaupload founder faces criminal copyright infringement, racketeering, and money laundering charges, which in theory could lead to decades in prison. Dotcom says he has a plan and doesn't intend to leave the country. More than twelve years have passed since Megaupload became the prime target in a high-profile law enforcement operation, which led to the collapse of Kim Dotcom’s file-storage empire. While time moved on, the New Zealand-based ‘Internet personality’ was still waiting to hear whether he would be extradited to the United States where a criminal prosecution is pending. With the stakes this high, no legal resources are being spared. Many millions of dollars have been poured into this legal battle since 2012, and the end is still nowhere in sight. In 2020, the Supreme Court of New Zealand ruled that Kim Dotcom and his colleagues could indeed be extradited to the United States. However, this still wasn’t set in stone, as judicial reviews and appeals were still pending. Megaupload defendants van der Kolk and Ortmann eventually opted for a deal. The pair pled guilty but were allowed to serve their respective 30 and 31-month prison sentences in New Zealand. Dotcom, meanwhile, vowed to ‘fight on’. “I’m now the last man standing in this fight and I will continue to fight because unlike my co-defendants I won’t accept the injustice we have been subjected to,” Dotcom said two years ago. Justice Minister Signs Dotcom Extradition In recent years, Dotcom hasn’t shied away from the public eye, often sharing controversial takes on political and societal events. In the background, however, potential extradition loomed, before reaching its conclusion earlier today. According to Stuff, New Zealand Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith informed Kim Dotcom that he will be deported to the United States to stand trial. “I have received extensive advice from the Ministry of Justice on this matter,” Goldsmith said. “I considered all of the information carefully, and have decided that Mr Dotcom should be surrendered to the US to face trial.” “As is common practice, I have allowed Mr Dotcom a short period of time to consider and take advice on my decision. I will not, therefore, be commenting further at this stage,” the Justice Minister added. Dotcom has always denied the charges and has left no stone unturned in support of his defense. This means that the latest extradition decision will be challenged as well. ‘I Have a Plan’ The Ministry of Justice confirmed the extradition order earlier today. Dotcom revealed the decision on social media earlier in the week, describing New Zealand as an “obedient U.S. colony”. “[T]he obedient US colony in the South Pacific just decided to extradite me for what users uploaded to Megaupload, unsolicited, and what copyright holders were able to remove with direct delete access instantly and without question. But who cares? That’s justice these days,” he wrote on Tuesday. Today, Dotcom followed up, stating that he has “a plan,” “loves New Zealand,” and doesn’t intend to leave the country. A Plan… The nature of Dotcom’s plan is unknown but if the past twelve years are any indication, he won’t let any adverse decision pass without a fight.",

Also for his pirate spirit and \"stick it to the man\" attitude. But everything has a limit, specifically his resistance against the law, even if he hid it behind virtues. I think it's clear for everybody that one cannot get away with this kind of stuff, once governments get involved. Isn't it wiser to stop at some point, and find other stuff to do, even if all your nerves say otherwise? But people are superficial and tend to develop an \"i'm the main character\" personality, pushing them into recklessness, like persisting doing certain things or publicly talking shit. Hope he and his family will be ok. reply gliiics 1 hour agoparentIt's not always black and white; let's be honest, yes, Kim Dotcom was probably more about piracy than freedom of whatever simply because that's where his money was.

They are not the same despite being united by the fact that in both cases the government got involved and said “stop that, it’s wrong”.

But one was started by ex-Paypal founders and the other bootstrapped (MegaUpload). Worse, while MegaUpload followed the letter of the law by doing removals of content that was reported as pirated they fell afoul of the law by stringently going after child pornographers and a court decided they can do that then they could do the same for piracy. So, they followed the law but, in their case, now the law is something entirely different and unexpected. reply itsoktocry 39 minutes agoparentprev>But people are superficial and tend to develop an \"i'm the main character\" personality How on earth are you labeling the people persistent to a fault \"superficial\"??? reply stainablesteel 5 hours agoparentprevnot really, his website was based on hong kong, this is a fight against america playing world police, which i'm on board with they have no business going after just a single man so fervently, he's a foreign national and the websites weren't based in the US reply z_ 2 hours agorootparentMega stored files in the US, Carpathia and Cogent were the providers specifically. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload_legal_case reply tim333 5 hours agorootparentprevHe was predominantly stealing US intellectual property, films, TV shows and music and the like.

I'm not sure about the morals but you can certainly understand financially why they've gone after him. reply csallen 1 hour agorootparentMinor nitpick, but he was not stealing, he was infringing copyrights. To \"steal\" is to take another's rivalrous property without permission, such that you now possess it, but they no longer have it. To \"infringe a copyright\" is to make and distribute a copy of another person's work without their permission. Both illegal, but very different things. What targets of copyright infringement are losing is not their property, but the potential extra profit they could have made if they'd retained their monopoly on the ability to copy and distribute their work. Stealing is illegal because it deprives people of their property. Copyright infringement is illegal because (theoretically) it leads to a world where people are less incentivized to create things because they won't be able to profit as much. reply singlow 2 minutes agorootparentThe word for stealing has been applied more broadly than your definition for millenia. __MatrixMan__ 50 minutes agorootparentprevThis.

They didn't just charge him with copyright infringement which itself would probably not be extraditable: >..charged in 2012 with engaging in a racketeering conspiracy, conspiring to commit copyright infringement, conspiring to commit money laundering and two counts of criminal copyright infringement. Often with US law enforcement where there's a will there's a way even if it doesn't strictly stick to normal legal practices.

I don't understand why they went to such extent pursuing a man for simply running a piracy site meanwhile US is losing influence and trust on geopolitical stage, shouldn't that be the bigger issue edit: im being rate limited so heres my response to comment below: I didn't say anybody was replacing US, merely they are losing credibility and prestige on world stage and this isn't recent and not slowing down. I don't think any country will be able to replace US and its freedom of maritime navigation anytime soon. China is in no position to project as its undergoing internal turmoil. Neither is Russia. BRICS also won't offer much. One potential non-zero chance scenario is the northern artic sea routes opening up due to rising temperatures melting ice bypassing the need to route through singapore and suez canal which would put Russia back on the power map. US is a hyperpower and there is no equal. Maybe a unified Korea with extended northern manchuria territories can fill the vacuum left by China and Russia in the region. I don't really see any other candidates. reply gameman144 2 hours agorootparentOne of the reasons the US is viewed as such a good place to start a business is that the country will go to bat for their (favored) businesses internationally.

Not sure if you know this, but there are tens of thousands of people involved in making a movie or TV series. Many making minimum wage and many who own businesses that are employed by the studios like catering companies. Or transportation companies, or even all the companies who tech they use like the camera's they use to film said movies. ALL of those people? Their employment DEPENDS on movie studio's and the work they do to keep them gainfully employed. When you pirate movies you're not taking money out of the faceless multi-trillion entertainment companies, you're taking money out of the people's pocket who are integral part of creating the movies and shows you watch and who's livelihood depends on their continued employment by those companies.

There was a reason Napster was popular in colleges, because many of those people were cash poor. Music industry revenue peaked in 2000 at $21B and went down to ~$7B in 2015 before steadily growing again. Also, the entertainment industry are not multi-trillion dollar conglomerates. Not even close. Disney is worth $160B and Netflix is $260B. That being said, if it were up to the music industry we'd still be paying the inflation adjusted equivalent of $20 for an album we only like one song on and we wouldn't be able to create out own playlists. You can only fight the consumer for so long (and they fought long and hard). That's to say nothing about the morality of repeatedly increasing copyright from 14 years to life plus 70 (which is BS).

No one can prove or even know what the impact of piracy is on a given work's short-term or long-term revenue. Maybe \"Firefly\" was boosted massively in its long-term commercial success by piracy, but some $400 physics textbook had materially less sales. I think there's a reason courts never debate this question, though. *I'm aware there are specific exceptions for things like fair use and timeshifting -- I just don't believe all 'harmless' acts are protected or that that was ever even intended. reply treprinum 5 hours agoprevDidn't YouTube get popular on pirated content first?

A couple points. First, wasn't there a huge issue where the data centers had money problems because the FBI (or some agency) was forcing them to retain all the data, as they didn't actually know for sure what was there? Or am I wrong and they had a list of specific files hosted on specific servers and were able to use that to demonstrate wrongdoing? Just because I say I'm going to hack the Gibson, doesn't mean I actually do it. Second, there is a real jurisdiction issue here. Kim Dotcom is a German citizen based in New Zealand. The servers themselves are (or were) hosted in the US. Did Kim Dotcom himself upload anything to them? I can absolutely see the case for shutting down servers that might contain illegal data. I don't see the case for extraditing someone to the US for allegedly breaking a law that applies neither to his country of origin nor residence. Also, I'm not sure why you're being so angry with me, I'm just looking at the facts.

I got the feeling she thought I was still guilty and had somehow managed to get away with the distribution of which I was suspected (or it was some kind of retro justification for gross violation of my rights and she was taking a front foot stance to minimise the chances I'd see what legal avenues are available in such situations - turns out very few to none). She specifically mentioned as suspicious: - history of downloading from MEGA - using virtual machines - having \"tor\" installed. Interesting combination of cluelessness (wait until they're introduced to containers!). MEGA somewhat stands out in that bunch, in that there are lots of similar services as far as I know. Makes me wonder if it's a honeypot (but maybe not, because then they'd know the only thing I downloaded from MEGA was android ROMs).

Toward the end, MEGA had transitioned to actually partnering with hip hop artists for distribution. The US has a long history of IP rights holders criminalizing new business models / protecting current models in law, and then a fair amount shaking down and sorting out happening as new technology hits the scene, going back to radio. Each of these waves has led to push / pull between distributors, retailers, artists and song writers, and whether or not you like it, that’s the system we have today.

That person might have their situation worsened by the officer who thinks the person they're talking to is obligated to answer to the officer's whims.

It was widely used by pirates, and MegaUpload earned a lot of money off of hosting pirated files because users would buy subscriptions to MegaUpload specifically because of the pirated content that they could download, without the limitations that are placed on the users of the free tier. With a paid subscription you got: - Multiple parallel downloads - Much faster speed - No waiting time between downloads A similar service was RapidShare, also popular with pirates. Pirate sites would typically split downloads into multiple parts due to restrictions on upload size on MegaUpload, RapidShare and other file hosts like that. They would then upload these parts to MegaUpload and RapidShare and one or two other file hosts so that: - If files were taken down from one host they might remain available for a bit more time from one of the other hosts - Free users could speed up download times by simultaneously downloading the different part files from different hosts. So you’d start a download for part 1 from MegaUpload, part 2 from RapidShare and part 3 from some other host. Then you’d occasionally check on the slow progress and the countdowns from each sites before they allowed you to download another part, and continuing downloading parts from each as soon as they allowed you to again after you finished downloading a previous part from them. The connection to Mega is that after MegaUpload was shut down, they started Mega and they made it so that all uploaded files were encrypted client side during upload and the URL contains a fragment with the encryption key so that it’s decrypted client side and the key is not shared with the server (unless of course the JS served by the server is modified to explicitly send the key to them either during upload or download). This solved a problem for the pirates and it solved a problem for Mega. Previously when a file was taken down, the host would usually make note of the hash of the file that was taken down and not allow that file to be uploaded and shared again. Now, with encryption users could reupload the exact same parts without having to do anything on their end. And the users downloading did not have to do any extra steps either on their end either. This benefits the pirates greatly. When you’ve spent 3 days downloading a bunch of part files and suddenly the remaining parts are all taken down and their hashes banned it sucked to be a pirate. But with this automatic encryption the same parts could be reuploaded and new links could be posted to pirate forums and the users could pick right up again where they were in the progress of downloading all the parts. Less work for users uploading. Less work for users downloading. Happier users. More paying customers. And in addition to more money, Mega also have less work to do as now when someone argues that they should police the uploads better they can point to the files all being encrypted and then not having the keys to decrypt the files there is no way that they actually can inspect the files they are storing for their users. (Again unless they modify the JS they serve to their users so that they intentionally send the key to the server.) Of course, encryption benefits everyone. Not just pirates. But at least to me it appeared strongly that the main motivation for building Mega and having it use this client side automatic encryption and decryption was very specifically because of the experience they had with takedown requests for intellectual property hosted on MegaUpload. It’s a neat way to cater to the pirates and encourages them to become paying customers of Mega. reply kalleboo 3 hours agorootparent> when a file was taken down, the host would usually make note of the hash of the file that was taken down and not allow that file to be uploaded and shared again One of the complaints the US case had was that MegaUpload specifically did not do this.

With Mega you only had to trust one server. reply codetrotter 3 hours agorootparentTorrent files have hash check sums of the fragments. If someone sends you a bad fragment it will be discarded. Magnet links are also hashes, so when you retrieve torrent metadata from your peers from a magnet link that data will also be verified for integrity. However, if the original torrent itself was made from malicious data then it’s still gonna result in malicious code on your system. Interestingly though, it is probably far more likely that a torrent with a very low number of seeders is malicious, than that a popular torrent contains malicious data in the files you download. I suppose it could still be possible that the malicious code sent by a peer was targeting a weakness in your torrent client itself though. And that they could get remote code execution on your computer that way.

They even paid people to upload high demand popular copyrighted files. They crossed a number of lines that other companies of the era didn’t dare cross. As far as equating Kim Dotcom to Assange and Snowden, if it isn’t clear by now that Assange and especially Snowden are Russian assets by now idk how to convince you. Like, Snowden tried to travel to Ecuador via Moscow and Hong Kong? Coincidentally just stopping by at the number one and number two intelligence agency adversaries of the United States? He could have just flown from Miami to Ecuador directly. Why didn’t his original plan involve flying to South America? It’s so obviously suspect in retrospect. But Kim Dotcom isn’t a political retribution target on that same level anyway, he’s just an egotistical idiot who thought he could play with law enforcement and get away with running a for-profit piracy website. The one thing Kim has in common with Assange and Snowden is that he could have avoided a decade of self-imposed house arrest and/or exile by facing justice in court and taking the L. But Kim is attached to his ideals so much that it he’s wasted a good chunk of his life with this issue hanging over him, all because he doesn’t want to give in to the pragmatic reality that he brought upon himself. reply klyrs 3 hours agorootparentI'm not sure that one can distinguish between a russian asset and a russian prisoner so easily. reply butlike 3 hours agorootparentprevYouTube got big because back in the day you could watch full movies uploaded to it. (pre-Google era) reply mrgoldenbrown 2 hours agorootparentBut was Google actively paying pirates to upload those full movies? That's the allegation against Kim. reply ric2b 5 hours agorootparentprevPlex and GPM never distributed pirated content, they just allowed users to host or upload their own content. Every social media allows image uploads and no one thinks about that but images online are constantly breaking copyright law. reply jpalawaga 4 hours agorootparentprevdidn't itunes let people convert their pirated music collections into legit paid ones? except they did a bad job by replacing tracks that sounded similar and then deleting the original. reply Aerroon 4 hours agorootparentprevOr even YouTube. reply dangus 3 hours agorootparentprevThere are big differences in the details there. I suggest you go to the Megaupload Wikipedia article and go to the “basis of indictment” section. Megaupload wasn’t even hiding behind a legitimate use case. It couldn’t be used as a personal file storage service because infrequently downloaded files would be deleted. The company paid people to upload popular files. The service had a comprehensive CSAM takedown process but no such process for copyright infringement. Basically, the US government was saying that Megaupload’s intent was extremely obvious. Sites like Crunchyroll and YouTube which started off being a haven for piracy had DCMA compliance as their shield. They complied with requests to take down content and weren’t building the entire business around infringement. Plex doesn’t enable you to distribute content beyond your household, and it’s also facilitating legal personal backups of commercial content. Google Play Music (and iTunes for that matter) were the same thing: making backups of your music is completely legal. Google Play wasn’t telling you to jump on LimeWire to illegally download your music. reply echelon 4 hours agorootparentprevGoogle Play Music let you upload your own music library to your own account. They didn't check or assert where you got your mp3s. Nobody else had access to your collection. From the beginning, Kim's company put itself front and center in the piracy world. It was advertised as an alternative to BitTorrent and you were meant to share links with others. When licensors and eventually authorities asked him to stop, he laughed at them and doubled down. He's played the pirate the whole time, and he's hated authority and venture capital and IP every step of the way. There's a reason he would up where he is versus the other IP grey area companies and products that became wildly successful. He deliberately chose this path. reply kwanbix 3 hours agoparentprevPoliticians steal, make horrible decisions, and worst things and nothing happens. But you share movies and go to prison! reply darby_nine 4 hours agoparentprev> It was too early, and too successful, without cutting in the existing rights holders properly. In a way that makes it much easier to argue against the idea that IP protects creators and not their pimps. reply ChrisMarshallNY 5 hours agoparentprev> without cutting in the existing rights holders properly. That's the killer, right there. \"existing rights holders\" is a big deal, and one that has been ignored by tech bros for a long time. As a [former] artist, and [former] musician, I can say that the tech industry has been cooking the Goose that Lays the Golden Eggs. The opportunity for individual financial and ego success is a huge driver for modern popular art culture (for better and for worse). If we take that away, guess what happens? No one wants to do it, anymore. This may be an issue, with AI-generated creative content. Unless the AI is truly better than human talent (and \"better\" is in the eye of the beholder), it has the very real prospect of turning the commercial creative industry into gray goo. [EDITED TO ADD] Watching the karma count on this post, yo-yoing up and down, has been fascinating. This seems to be an issue that people have very strong feelings about. reply amanaplanacanal 5 hours agorootparentDestroying commercial art culture really might not be a bad thing. The overwhelming majority of visual artists, writers and musicians don’t make money from their art, and would continue doing it even if the big corporate parasites went bankrupt. reply ChrisMarshallNY 5 hours agorootparent> The overwhelming majority of visual artists, writers and musicians don’t make money from their art I wouldn't be so sure about that. The overwhelming majority don't make big money, but many, many creatives make a living on their art, and a lot of them are OK with being fairly low-paid (I know quite a few). They do what they love, and get paid enough to keep doing it. As a musician friend of mine says \"You know what's great? I get to play music for people, and then they pay me for it, when I'm done!\". He is not a huge rock star, but does well enough to tour around the country. People tend to sneer at creatives, thinking of them as \"parasites,\" or \"doing something that anyone can do, so why should they be paid?\" I can tell you that I appreciate having a trained professional designer, help me with my software design. They can do something like fart out a logo in five minutes, that can become one of the most significant assets a company has. That's a really valuable skill. We'll have to see if AI can actually replace that. It probably will, for many contexts. It's gotta be better than some of the efforts I see, by engineers that think they are creative, but aren't. reply amanaplanacanal 3 hours agorootparentThere are way more people that draw, paint, sing, or play an instrument for their own and their friends enjoyment than any who make a living at it. Not sure how you could think that’s not true. reply ChrisMarshallNY 3 hours agorootparentAnd software engineers that do it? Actually, that's what I do, these days. Take a gander at my work. It's not exactly \"Hobby grade\" stuff, but I don't make a dime from it. I'm grateful for the many years of being a professional, that helped make it possible for me to do it creatively, these days. reply whycome 4 hours agorootparentprevHow would his career change if AI music become prevalent? He could still play for crowds and get paid. Does he ever play covers? He benefits from the work of others too. He might one day play covers of some hit AI tunes. reply account42 4 hours agorootparentprev> \"You know what's great? I get to play music for people, and then they pay me for it, when I'm done!\" This transaction does not need IP protection at all. reply earthnail 5 hours agorootparentprevI believe the implications are a bit different. It takes a lot of time to learn to make music. If you can’t make it as a famous artists (the odds of which are about as high as becoming a football star), you previously still had the option to use your music skills to make money with boring work: music for ads for example. That’s going away. Now it’s becoming a lot more like professional sports: either you make it, or your hard earned skills are useless on the job market. It increases the risk significantly and will lead to less people pursuing a musician career. I hope that my explanation is not perceived as judging in any way, but purely as an explanation. reply CaptWillard 5 hours agorootparent\"either you make it, or your hard earned skills are useless on the job market\" I think uncommon focus, discipline, physical and mental dexterity along with the ability to perform under pressure are being undervalued here. reply throwway_278314 4 hours agorootparentI've been out of work for close to 6 months now, actively searching, interviewing every week, and finding that what the job market seems to value is that you have done the exact same thing as what they are hiring for. I've discovered breakthrough algos and delivered solutions which personalize medical care, sometimes with life and death outcomes. Yet somehow that doesn't count when the company wants someone who has done personalization for consumer products. I have other examples from other common DS roles/tasks, where I have done the equivalent thing to that role in a different context. And somehow that never seems to count. So no, I don't have strong evidence that the job market values generic skills. Perhaps your experience has been different? I can also hear someone saying \"with the attitude that the poster is taking, I'm not surprised\"-- so let me point out how difficult it is to extract attitude from text, and that the context here (presenting evidence to refute a claim) is very different from an interview context. reply butlike 3 hours agorootparentprevFor.

That's the by-product. reply underlipton 4 hours agorootparentprevIt'd seem to me that a society that values art would find a way to keep artists secure economically while letting as many people as possible enjoy their work. I tend to think of piracy as a scapegoat for the draining of the working and middle class's purchasing power. Napster and Spotify came along as people were beginning to find it prohibitively expensive to drop $20 on an album. People would pay if they could (some do, if vinyl sales are anything to go by). reply bobajeff 5 hours agorootparentprev>The opportunity for individual financial and ego success is a huge driver for modern popular art culture (for better and for worse). If we take that away, guess what happens? No one wants to do it, anymore. I don't know about financial success but I think losing ego building as artist incentives might not be a bad thing. Maybe it's an unhealthy focus and probably shouldn't be supported. Intuitively, I think those kind of drives will not go away no matter what support you give it. However, I can't believe that feeding that beast is not having an effect. reply butlike 3 hours agorootparentBeing \"the guy\" is the moat in entertainment. The problem is if you remove that, then the throngs of folks can make content to where it becomes \"if everyone's special, no one is.\" I get it, I just wish it wasn't the case. reply ChrisMarshallNY 5 hours agorootparentprevThe ego stuff can be sickening, but it is definitely a draw. Some of the best musicians and artists, ever, have been rather appalling personalities. I won't go into naming names. reply butlike 3 hours agorootparentIf you get used to stepping on the shoulders of others, that cascades to other aspects of your life and sooner-or-later a paparazzi video comes out of you being a dick to wait staff or worse. reply EasyMark 4 hours agorootparentprevNo we just realized people who pirate likely aren’t going to buy it anyway, you can’t claim lost profits for ~$0. reply ChrisMarshallNY 4 hours agorootparentI wouldn't say that, myself. In the case of software (a creative product that many, here, have a vested interest in), pirating can actually lead to future sales. I think one of the most pirated programs out there, used to be Adobe Photoshop. This resulted in a huge number of folks that became expert Photoshop users, and that drove sales of the app, in their careers. The same probably cannot be said for games. I suspect a pirated game, is a lost sale. reply butlike 3 hours agorootparentPersonal experience (sample size: 1), a lost sale when I was age 16 made a true believer out of me for some developers, so at 35 I buy their games no question day 1. A lot can change in 19 years, but I've gone back and bought most every game I pirated on steam now that the income isn't as scarce. reply ChrisMarshallNY 3 hours agorootparentFor myself, I also pay for my creative consumer stuff (streaming and art). It's a bit dispiriting, to be sneered at, for it. reply thaumasiotes 2 hours agorootparentprevWho are these developers making reliably good games over 20 years? Lemmings was a great game, but that isn't informative as to Grand Theft Auto, which isn't. reply shadowgovt 24 minutes agorootparentprevAnecdotally, when I was in a grad-level design class as an undergrad, 100% of my classmates first learned to use their tools via a jailbroken copy of professional software. At that level of competition for opportunity, it just wasn't good enough to have waited until you got to college to learn these tools; you needed to have been playing with them in high school to be fluent enough to look good on a college application form (or a grad application form four years later). AutoCAD, in particular, used to be[1] super smart about this and went out of their way to get their toolchain in front of high-schoolers (even back when that involved pricy copy-protection solutions like physical dongles). [1] Not to imply they are no longer super-smart about it; I just no longer have clear signal. reply chaostheory 4 hours agorootparentprevThe music industry isn’t a “goose that lays golden eggs” for the greater economy. It’s not as democratic or accessible as the tech industry either. You’d have a stronger argument if it was at least fair to the artists that it purportedly represents. It’s not. reply ChrisMarshallNY 4 hours agorootparentThe music industry has been the one making the pots and pans. But it is also the one that has been making it possible for creatives to become obscenely rich. It's actually only fairly recently, in history, that creatives could become independently successful, without having patrons. I don't know of anyone that has become rich, using Patreon (I could be wrong, though, as it has never really been something that I've paid attention to). Not sure if the patronage model works for creatives. It's fascinating to see folks in tech, who are obsessed with becoming rich robber barons, get upset at the prospect of other people getting rich, doing non-tech stuff. reply fluoridation 4 hours agorootparentA few people becoming obscenely rich is not a good in itself. That is to say, it's not a reason that justifies the music industry existing as it does today. That would be like arguing that it's good (just in general) that smoking is banned because I specifically don't like smoking. A good reason could be that it causes more music to be made, or better music, or it lets more people make music. I honestly have no idea if that's true. Certainly the last one isn't; what lets more people make music is access to technology, not the possibility of getting rich. reply chaostheory 3 hours agorootparentprevThis isn’t a good argument since extremely few creatives get obscenely rich and few creatives are even able to generate a decent income to do things like being able to buy a home. At least in tech, the pot is more evenly distributed and for more types of people. It even contributes to the broader economy as a whole with genuine innovation as opposed to just collecting rent on IP. reply ChrisMarshallNY 3 hours agorootparentWell, as a [former] creative, myself, I don't think that I'd consider what I did, \"collecting rent on IP.\" In fact, if you look at the behavior of many tech company legal teams, that seems more like what tech corporations do, than individual creatives.

The music industry can't hold a candle to some of the raw destruction that has been wrought by tech. It's just balanced by a lot of good (and making tech billionaires isn't really what I consider \"good\"). reply butlike 3 hours agorootparentprevI...I want to make ego-less music... ._. reply kmeisthax 3 hours agorootparentprevYou're mixing several valid criticisms of the tech industry with a really invalid critique of Free Culture[0]. If it were true that \"taking away the opportunity for individual financial and ego success\" meant nobody makes creative works anymore, then we wouldn't have Wikipedia, the SCP Foundation wiki, GNU, or Linux. I also want to point out that it was specifically the Free Software people who fired the first shot against generative AI, because a lot of our licenses are designed to resist enclosure of the commons. Yes, the tech industry is an interloper in an industry that has had long-standing sweetheart deals with governments both liberal, neoliberal[1], and otherwise. However, that industry - the creative industry - was not at all pro-artist beyond making sure artists had something worth stealing. The tech industry started out not understanding the creative industry's norms and laws, but has long since graduated into facilitating new versions of some of its worst abuses. We're not the same tech industry that gave the world Napster anymore. The whole reason why, e.g., Apple gets to charge a blatantly supra-competitive 30% on every purchase on iPhone comes down to copyright ownership over iOS. To wit: most of the biggest cheerleaders for generative AI are in the creative industry. You have CEOs ranting and raving about how once the plausible sentence generators are up to speed, they can fire entire classes of artists and workers. Videogame companies make voice actors audibly consent to voice cloning at the start of each recording session. The RIAA is not suing Udio to protect the role of musicians, they're suing so they can produce a \"licensed\" model that nicely cuts artists and bands out of their royalties. Yes, the people in the GenAI space have a \"fast and loose\" interpretation of copyright, but that's less \"information wants to be free\" and more \"we'll ask for forgiveness and take a license once all this AI fairy dust pays out\". Licensed GenAI is not going to be any better than the current state of affairs because the threat of GenAI is not the copying of any one individual work. Copyright is an individualistic system, and ownership is for owners, not workers. And even if you decide you'll never license your specific work to AI, someone else will, and the system will still work the same. As creative workers, the threat to you from GenAI is from collective obsolescence, a loss of social position and privilege, and decreases in your material standard of living due to the above. Copyright exists to perpetuate capitalism, and thus considers none of those consequences to be violations of the law. There is no copyright law that would",

    "originBody": "Nomad Network - Communicate Freely Off-grid, resilient mesh communication with strong encryption, forward secrecy and extreme privacy. Nomad Network allows you to build private and resilient communications platforms that are in complete control and ownership of the people that use them. No signups, no agreements, no handover of any data, no permissions and gatekeepers. Nomad Network is build on LXMF and Reticulum, which together provides the cryptographic mesh functionality and peer-to-peer message routing that Nomad Network relies on. This foundation also makes it possible to use the program over a very wide variety of communication mediums, from packet radio to fiber optics. Nomad Network does not need any connections to the public internet to work. In fact, it doesn't even need an IP or Ethernet network. You can use it entirely over packet radio, LoRa or even serial lines. But if you wish, you can bridge islanded networks over the Internet or private ethernet networks, or you can build networks running completely over the Internet. The choice is yours. Since Nomad Network uses Reticulum, it is efficient enough to run even over extremely low-bandwidth medium, and has been succesfully used over 300bps radio links. If you'd rather want to use an LXMF client with a graphical user interface, you may want to take a look at Sideband, which is available for Linux, Android and macOS. Notable Features Encrypted messaging over packet-radio, LoRa, WiFi or anything else Reticulum supports. Zero-configuration, minimal-infrastructure mesh communication Distributed and encrypted message store holds messages for offline users Connectable nodes that can host pages and files Node-side generated pages with PHP, Python, bash or others Built-in text-based browser for interacting with contents on nodes An easy to use and bandwidth efficient markup language for writing pages Page caching in browser How do I get started? The easiest way to install Nomad Network is via pip: # Install Nomad Network and dependencies pip install nomadnet # Run the client nomadnet # Or alternatively run as a daemon, with no user interface nomadnet --daemon # List options nomadnet --help If you are using an operating system that blocks normal user package installation via pip, you can return pip to normal behaviour by editing the ~/.config/pip/pip.conf file, and adding the following directive in the [global] section: [global] break-system-packages = true Alternatively, you can use the pipx tool to install Nomad Network in an isolated environment: # Install Nomad Network pipx install nomadnet # Optionally install Reticulum utilities pipx install rns # Optionally install standalone LXMF utilities pipx install lxmf # Run the client nomadnet # Or alternatively run as a daemon, with no user interface nomadnet --daemon # List options nomadnet --help Please Note: If this is the very first time you use pip to install a program on your system, you might need to reboot your system for the program to become available. If you get a \"command not found\" error or similar when running the program, reboot your system and try again. The first time the program is running, you will be presented with the Guide section, which contains all the information you need to start using Nomad Network. To use Nomad Network on packet radio or LoRa, you will need to configure your Reticulum installation to use any relevant packet radio TNCs or LoRa devices on your system. See the Reticulum documentation for info. For a general introduction on how to set up such a system, take a look at this post. If you want to try Nomad Network without building your own physical network, you can connect to the Unsigned.io RNS Testnet over the Internet, where there is already some Nomad Network and LXMF activity. If you connect to the testnet, you can leave nomadnet running for a while and wait for it to receive announces from other nodes on the network that host pages or services, or you can try connecting directly to some nodes listed here: abb3ebcd03cb2388a838e70c001291f9 Dublin Hub Testnet Node ea6a715f814bdc37e56f80c34da6ad51 Frankfurt Hub Testnet Node To browse pages on a node that is not currently known, open the URL dialog in the Network section of the program by pressing Ctrl+U, paste or enter the address and select Go or press enter. Nomadnet will attempt to discover and connect to the requested node. Install on Android You can install Nomad Network on Android using Termux, but there's a few more commands involved than the above one-liner. The process is documented in the Android Installation section of the Reticulum Manual. Once the Reticulum has been installed according to the linked documentation, Nomad Network can be installed as usual with pip. For a native Android application with a graphical user interface, have a look at Sideband. Docker Images Nomad Network is automatically published as a docker image on Github Packages. Image tags are one of either master (for the very latest commit) or the version number (eg 0.2.0) for a specific release. $ docker pull ghcr.io/markqvist/nomadnet:master # Run nomadnet interactively in a container $ docker run -it ghcr.io/markqvist/nomadnet:master --textui # Run nomadnet as a daemon, using config stored on the host machine in specified # directories, and connect the containers network to the host network (which will # allow the default AutoInterface to automatically peer with other discovered # Reticulum instances). $ docker run -d \\ -v /local/path/nomadnetconfigdir/:/root/.nomadnetwork/ \\ -v /local/path/reticulumconfigdir/:/root/.reticulum/ \\ --network host ghcr.io/markqvist/nomadnet:master # You can also keep the network of the container isolated from the host, but you # will need to manually configure one or more Reticulum interfaces to reach other # nodes in a network, by editing the Reticulum configuration file. $ docker run -d \\ -v /local/path/nomadnetconfigdir/:/root/.nomadnetwork/ \\ -v /local/path/reticulumconfigdir/:/root/.reticulum/ \\ ghcr.io/markqvist/nomadnet:master # Send daemon log output to console instead of file $ docker run -i ghcr.io/markqvist/nomadnet:master --daemon --console Tools & Extensions Nomad Network is a very flexible and extensible platform, and a variety of community-provided tools, utilities and node-side extensions exist: NomadForum (GitHub mirror) NomadForecast micron-blog md2mu Any2MicronConverter Some nomadnet page examples More nomadnet page examples LXMF-Bot LXMF Messageboard LXMEvent POPR LXMF Tools Help & Discussion For help requests, discussion, sharing ideas or anything else related to Nomad Network, please have a look at the Nomad Network discussions pages.

NomadNet is just one of the messengers. There is Sideband, a mobile app client (https://github.com/markqvist/Sideband), and Reticulum MeshChat, developed by Liam Cottle which is a browser based client https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat. Reticulum can work over anything that has a throughput greater than 5 bits a second (yes, bits) and a MDU of 500 bytes. Not only can it work over hundreds of different carriers (LoRa, BLE, Packet Radio, overlay networks like Tor and I2P) but each of these carriers can be apart of the same network. I threw together a quick proof of concept of it working over HF radio. I setup two nodes about 144 km (90 miles) separate. Both were ICOM-7300's with a Raspberry Pi 5 driving the software modem that would take packets from Reticulum and send them over the air. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blwNVumLujc Node 1 was out in the field while Node 2 was back at my house. Node 2 had two interfaces setup, one for the HF modem and another connected to the TCP testnet. This means that Node 1 could access any peer that was over on the TCP testnet.

If you replicate a piece of data based on whether you or your (explicitly trusted) peers are interested in it, then the only way to flood the network is to convince all of the users to become interested in it, which is likely difficult enough to discourage misbehavior. pub/sub, not request/response. reply dicknuckle 3 hours agorootparentprevblockchain can be cheap (power, compute etc) and not crap.

No. All blockchain is crap, no exceptions are fundamentally possible. The reality reflects that rather starkly. By \"blockchain\" I mean a system with a distributed consesus via proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. reply __MatrixMan__ 1 hour agorootparentSo it stops being a blockchain if the criteria for adding a block is based on something else? Or do you intend to update your definition to incorporate other consensus mechanisms as they emerge? Seems to me that a more useful definition would abstract out the consensus model such that a blockchain is essentially a merkle-linked-list together with some function for determining which of two candidate next-blocks will be the actual one, but without getting too specific for what that function is... just because there's so much potential for variation there. reply jazzyjackson 2 minutes agorootparent> just because there's so much potential for variation there.

I first shared the notes on my website some time ago. But it took me a while to arXiv them, because I wanted to simultaneously make public most of the other course materials. I now have, which means the following are now available to all: Notes forming a complete, self-contained account of the part of Galois theory that we covered. About 40 short explanatory videos. A large collection of problems. Nearly 500 multiple choice questions. I’m a little bemused by the popularity of the Galois theory notes. I’ve made quite a few sets of course notes public before, e.g.: Fourier analysis General topology Linear algebra Category theory But the Galois theory notes seem to have caught on in a way that none of the others have (except category theory — but that one, I made into a book). It’s true that I probably took a bit of extra care on them: I first taught the course during full Covid lockdown, and I felt the students would need more guidance than usual, given that they were deprived of all opportunities for face-to-face interaction. But I wonder whether the real reason is that the Galois theory notes simply look nicer, with colour and little icons and so on. In any case, I hope the notes, videos and questions bring people joy.

I've been shouting from the rooftops for years that math[0] courses need more context. We can prove X, Y, and Z, and this class will teach you that, but the motivating problem that led to our ability to do X, Y, and Z is mentioned only in passing. We can work something out, and then come back and rework it in more generality, but then that reworking becomes a thing in and of itself. And this is great! Further advances come from doing just this. But for pedagogical purposes, stuff sticks in the human brain so much better if we teach the journey, and not just the destination. I found teaching Calculus I was able to draw in students so much more if I worked in what problems Newton was trying to solve and why. It gave them a story to follow, a reason to learn this stuff.

But I don't know if this says more about the aid of history to the process of remembering or about my a priori interest in the topic for those particular classes. For a really good example of integrating the history along with the mathematics, and much more accessible than those math texts, I would recommend \"Journey Through Genius\" by Dunham[0]. It may be a little dated (published in 1990) and its focus is limited to algebra, geometry, number theory, and the history is perhaps too Western-biased, but it's good and it's short. Its material would make a solid foundation to build on top of because, in addition to the historical context, it shows a lot of the thought process into approaching certain landmark problems.

It gave them a story to follow, a reason to learn this stuff. Be careful. In undergrad, I worked as a math tutor at their tutoring institute. We had two calculus classes - one for engineers/science and the other for business/economics. If you're into Newtonian stuff or it's relevant to your degree, then your approach is all great. What I consistently saw is people in degrees like biology (or even industrial engineering) had a harder time learning because of those physics applications in the book. They came in with one problem: Having trouble with the calculus. And then they discovered they had two problems: To understand calculus they suddenly had to understand physics as well. You'd get students who were totally adept at differentiating and integrating, but would struggle with the problems that involved physics. Yes, it is important to be able to translate real world problems to math ones, but it's a bigger problem when you don't care about that particular field. Same problem with the business students. Since all the tutors were engineering folks, they had trouble tutoring the business students because their textbook was full of examples that required basic finance knowledge (and it really doesn't help that financial quantities are discrete and not continuous, adding to the tutors' confusion). If you can find an application the student is interested in, then by all means, use that approach. For a general purpose textbook, though, it hinders learning for many students who don't care for the particular choice of application the book decided to use. reply dataflow 3 hours agoparentprevDo they explain anywhere why we consider radicals special and ask these questions about them in the first place? Nobody ever explains that. To my programmer brain, whether I'm solving t^3 = 2 or t^100 + t + 1 = 7 numerically, I have to use an iterative method like Newton's either way. (\"But there's a button for Nth root\" isn't an argument here - they could've added a more generic button for Newton.) They don't fundamentally seem any different. Why do I care whether they're solvable in terms of radicals? It almost feels as arbitrary as asking whether something is solvable without using the digit 2. I would've thought I'd be more interested in whether they're solvable in some other respect (via iteration, via Newton, with quadratic convergence, or whatever)? reply impendia 1 hour agorootparentI'd say one of the fundamental lessons of field and Galois theory is that they're not intrinsically special. They're just easier and more appealing to write down. (For the most part, anyway. They're a little bit special in some subspecialties for some technical reasons that are hard to explain.) One reason to focus on them: when you tell students that x^5 - x - 1 = 0 can't be solved by radicals, that \"even if God told you the answer, you would have no way to write it down\", this is easy to understand and a powerful motivator for the theory. It's a nice application which is not fundamental, but which definitely shows that the theory has legs. If you want to know which polynomials are solvable by Newton's method? All of them. It illustrates that Newton's method is extremely useful, but the answer itself is not exactly interesting. reply returningfory2 57 minutes agorootparent> \"even if God told you the answer, you would have no way to write it down\" But isn't this also true for generic quadratics/cubics too? Like the solution to x^3-2=0 is cubed_root_of(2), so it seems we can \"write it down\". But what is the definition of cubed_root_of(2)? Well, it's the positive solution to x^3-2=0... reply impendia 23 minutes agorootparentWhen I say that a fundamental lesson of field theory is that radicals are not really special, this is what I mean. You are thinking in a more sophisticated way than most newcomers to the subject. reply sesm 22 minutes agorootparentprevIn a real problem you can have equations with parameters, where coefficients depend on some other parameters. And you should be able to answer questions about the roots depending on parameter values, like 'in which range of parameters p you have real (non-complex) roots'? Having a formula for the roots based on coefficients lets you answer such questions easily. For example, for quadratic equation ax^2 +bx + c = 0 we have D = b^2 - 4ac, and if DTo my programmer brain, whether I'm solving t^3 = 2 or t^100 + t + 1 = 7 numerically Typically when you're solving a polynomial equation in an applied context (programming, engineering, physics, whatever), it's because you have modeled a situation as a polynomial, and the information you really want is squirreled away as the roots of that polynomial. You don't actually care about the exact answer. You've only got k bits of precision anyway, so Newton's method is fine. But we're not interested in the solution. We don't particularly care that t = approx. 1.016 is a numerical solution.[0] We're not using polynomials to model a situation. In mathematics, we are often studying polynomials as objects in and of themselves, in which case the kind of roots we get tells us something about polynomials work, or we are using polynomials as a lens through which to study something else. In either case it's less about a specific solution, and more about what kind of solution it is and how we got it. Not to mention, specific polynomials are examples. Instead of t^100 + t + 1 = 7, we're usually looking at something more abstract like at^100 + bt + c. [0] And in the rare case we actually care about a specific root of a specific polynomial, and approximate numerical solution is often not good enough. reply enugu 1 hour agorootparentprevThe prime importance of solving by radicals is actually, that it led to the theory of groups! Groups are used in all sorts of places. (One nice pictorial example is fundamental group of a topological space). Just like Complex numbers arose in trying to solve the cubic. Also, the statement of Fermat's Last Theorem doesn't have any applications but its solution led to lot of interesting theory like how ideals get factorized in rings, elliptic curves, Galois representations... BTW, the same theory can be extended to differential equations and Differential Galois Theory tells you if you can get a solution by composing basic functions along with exponentials. Historically, radicals can be motivated by looking at people trying to solve linear, then quadratics, medieval duels about cubics and quartics, the futile search for solving quintics etc. Incidentally, quintics and any degree can have a closed form solution using modular functions.

They invert an algebraic operation we often encounter when trying to solve equations handed to us by e.g. physics. I find it understandable to want to give them a name. Why not something like \"those things we can solve with Newton\"? As you note Newton is broadly applicable; one would hope, given how popular the need to invert an exponent is, that something better (faster, more stable) if more specific than Newton might be created. It is hard to study a desired hypothetical operation without giving it a name. On a related note, how come we don't all already have the names of the 4th order iterative operation (iterated exponents) and its inverse in our heads? Don't they deserve consideration? Perhaps, but nature doesn't seem to hand us instances of those operations very often. We seemingly don't need them to build a bridge or solve some other common practical engineering problem. I imagine that is why they fail to appear in high school algebra courses. reply photonthug 1 hour agorootparentprev> Do they explain anywhere why we consider radicals special and ask these questions about them in the first place? Nobody ever explains that. To my programmer brain, But regardless of whether you're a programmer, mathematician, machinist, carpenter, or just a kid playing with legos, there's always a good time to be had in the following way: first you look at the most complex problems that you can manage to solve with simple tools; then you ask if your simple tools are indeed the simplest; and then if multiple roughly equivalently simple things are looking tied in this game you've invented then now you get the joy of endlessly arguing about what is most \"natural\" or \"beautiful\" or what \"simple\" even means really. Even when this game seems pretty dumb and arbitrary, you're probably learning a lot, because even when you can't yet define what you mean by \"simple\" or \"natural\" or \"pretty\" it's often still a useful search heuristic. What can you do with a lot of time and a compass and a ruler? Yes but do we need the \"rule\" part or only the straight-edge? What can we make with only SKI combinators? Yes but how awkward, I rather prefer BCKW. Who's up for a round of code-golf with weird tiny esolangs? Can we make a zero instruction-set computer? What's the smallest number of tools required to put an engine together? Yes but is it theoretically possible that we might need a different number of different tools to take one apart? Sure but does that really count as a separate tool? And so it goes.. aren't we having fun yet?? reply bubble12345 2 hours agorootparentprevYou are right in the sense that solvability by radicals has no practical importance, especially when it comes to calculations. It is just a very classical pure math question, dating back hundreds of years ago. Its solution led to the development of group theory and Galois theory. Group theory and Galois theory then are foundational in all kinds of areas. Anyway, so why care about solvability by radicals? To me the only real reason is that it's an interesting and a natural question in mathematics. Is there a general formula to solve polynomials, like the quadratic formula? The answer is no - why? When can we solve a polynomial in radicals and how? And so on. If you like pure math, you might find solvability by radicals interesting. It's also a good starting point and motivation for learning Galois theory. reply Joker_vD 2 hours agorootparentprevI imagine it has something to do with the fact that there is a somewhat simple pen-and-paper procedure, quite similar to long division, for calculating square/cubic/etc. roots to arbitrary precision, digit by digit. So finding roots is, in a sense, an arithmetic operation; and of calculus one better not speak in a polite society. reply fredilo 59 minutes agorootparentprevSuperb question! Interestingly, my math professor asked the exact same question after teaching Galois theory and stated that he does not have a good answer himself. Let me try to give sort of an answer. :) We have fingers. These we can count. This is why we are interested in counting. This is gives us the natural numbers and why we are interested in them. What can we do with natural numbers? Well the basic axioms allow only one thing: Increment them. Now, it is a natural question to ask what happens when we increment repeatedly. This leads to addition of natural numbers. The next question is to ask is whether we can undo addition. This leads to subtraction. Next, we ask whether all natural numbers can be subtracted. The answer is no. Can we extend the natural numbers such that this is possible? Yes, and in come the integers. Now, that we have addition. We can ask whether we can repeat it. This leads to multiplication with a natural number. Next, we ask whether we can undo it and get division and rational numbers. We can also ask whether multiplication makes sense when both operands are non-natural. Now, that we have multiplication, we can ask whether we can repeat it. This gives us the raising to the power of a natural number. Can we undo this? This gives radicals. Can we take the root of any rational number? No, and in come rational field extensions including the complex numbers. A different train of thought asks what we can do with mixing multiplication and addition. An infinite number of these operations seems strange, so let's just ask what happens when we have finite number. It turns out, no matter how you combine multiplication and addition, you can always rearrange them to get a polynomial. Formulated differently: Every branch-free and loop-free finite program is a polynomial (when disregarding numeric stability). This view as a program is what motivates the study of polynomials. Now, that we have polynomials, we can ask whether we can undo them. This motivates looking at roots of polynomials. Now, we have radicals and roots of polynomials. Both motivated independently. It is natural to ask whether both trains of thought lead to the same mathematical object. Galois theory answers this and says no. This is a somewhat surprising result, because up to now, no matter in which order we asked the questions: Can we repeat? Can we undo? How to enable undo by extension? We always ended up with the same mathematical object. Here this is not the case. This is why the result of Galois theory is so surprising to some. Slightly off-topic but equally interesting is the question about what happens when we allow loops in our programs with multiplication and addition? i.e. we ask what happens when we mix an infinite number of addition and multiplication. Well, this is somewhat harder to formalize but a natural way to look at it is to say that we have some variable, in the programming sense, that we track in each loop iteration. The values that this variable takes forms a sequence. Now, the question is what will this variable end up being when we iterate very often. This leads to the concept of limit of a sequence. Sidenote: You can look at the usual mathematical limit notation as a program. The limit sign is the while-condition of the loop and the part that describes the sequence is the body of the loop. Now that we have limits and rational numbers, we can ask how to extend the rational numbers such that every rational sequence has a limit. This gives us the real numbers. Now we can ask the question of undoing the limit operation. Here the question is what undoing here actually means. One way to look at it is whether you can find for every limit, i.e., every real number, a multiply-add-loop-program that describes the sequence whose limit was taken. The answer turns out to be no. There is a countable infinite number of programs but uncountably infinite many real numbers. There are way more real numbers than programs. In my opinion this is a way stranger result than that of Galois theory. It turns out, that nearly no real number can be described by a program, or even more generally any textual description. For this reason, in my opinion, real numbers are the strangest construct in all of mathematics. I hope you found my rambling interesting.

The 19th and 20th Centuries added rigor and formalism (and elitism) and devalued intuition, to the point that it begame uninterpretable to most. The 21st Century's major contribution to mathematics (including YouTube! and conversational style writing) was to bring back intuition, with the backing of formal foundations. reply Agingcoder 3 hours agorootparentI like your idea. I was schooled in abstract 20th century math - indeed YouTube is the opposite, and it’s a good thing. One of my math teachers was once talking to Jean Dieudonné https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Dieudonn%C3%A9 who was part of the Bourbaki group and asked him why on earth he insisted on inflicting raw dry theory to the world with no intuition , when his day job involved drawing ideas all day long ! Edit: interestingly enough, one of my colleagues thinks very strongly that intuition should not be shared, and the path to intuition should be walked by everyone so that they ´ Make their own mental images ´. I guess that there’s a tradeoff between making things accessible, and deeply understood, but I don’t know what to make of his opinion. reply stoneman24 1 hour agorootparentThe ‘make thier own mental models’ vs sharing/providing full information is difficult. ‘Make thier own model’ of the domain can lead to deeper understanding but takes time and may lead to different (possibly incorrect) understanding of the issues and complexities. If not reviewed with others. Providing full information upfront to a person can be quicker but lead to a superficial knowledge. I think that it comes down to whether that deeper knowledge is directly needed for the main task.

According to someone on Stack Exchange, \"The most serious difficulties with Euclid from the modern point of view is that he did not realize that an axiom was needed for congruence of triangles, Euclids proof by superposition is not considered as a valid proof.\" But making mistakes in a formal treatment of a subject does not negate the fact that it is a formal treatment of the subject IMHO, and AFAICR none of the theorems in Elements is wrong; i.e., Elements is formal enough to have avoided a mistake even though the axioms listed weren't all the axiom that are actually needed to support the theorems. 18th Century European math was much more potent than ancient Greek math, and although parts of it like algebra and geometry were, for a long time, most of it was not understood at a formal or rigorous level for a long time even if we accept the level of rigor found in Elements. reply koolala 1 hour agorootparentIsn't how formal or rigorous something is just a social convention? Grammer Nazi's used to make online speech be formal with perfect rigor.

In mathematics, the word formal refers to something more specific: one or more statements written using a set of symbols which have fully-defined rules for mechanically transforming them into another form. A formal proof is then one which proceeds by a series of these mechanical steps beginning with one or more premises and ending with a conclusion (or goal). reply gowld 1 hour agorootparentprevElements is mostly formal, but it's also concrete and visual. Euclid developed arithmetic and algebra through constructive geometry, which relies on our visual intuition to solve problems. Non-concrete problems were totally out of scope. Even curved surfaces (denying the parallel postulate) were byond Euclid. Notably, Elements didn't have imaginary or transcendental numbers.

The brilliant insight Galois figured out is that there is a fundamental connection between fields and groups, but that is just the \"technique\" with which he solved the problem. The \"why even bother\" is a bit more complex but simply put Galois wanted to establish a criterion to determine what polynomials are solvable or unsolvable in which fields. E.g. we know x^2=-1 is solvable in C with x=i but not in real numbers. Can we generalize that proof to such a degree that we can mechanistically run it for arbitrary polynomials in arbitrary fields? reply fredilo 38 minutes agoparentprevWhat it states is correct and it gives you a good overview over what you do in a Galois theory course. It does, however, not give you an idea of why this is interesting. When just reading that article one might get the idea that some mathematicians just had too much free time. I tried to motivate the questions leading to Galois Theory in https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41258726 in a way that is hopefully accessible to more down-to-earth programmers and engineers. reply fredilo 20 minutes agorootparentI should probably add why I think the motivation is so important here. For pure engineers, numbers are a tool. They ask: What can I build with numbers? Pure mathematicians ask a different question. They are interested in the limits of numbers. They ask: What can I not build with numbers? Studying these two questions is deeply related but also a constant source of frustration for engineers taking math courses designed for mathematicians by mathematicians. Galois theory, is a theory of \"no\". It ultimately serves to answer several \"Can I build this?\" questions with no. This makes it very interesting to pure mathematicians. However, for pure engineers that are looking for numeric machine parts that can be assembled in other useful ways to actually build something... Galois theory can be quite disappointing. reply retrac 34 minutes agoprevTangential, but I read a little about Evariste Galois recently. His life was truly strange, fiery, short, and tragic. He's in large part responsible for both group theory and Galois theory, laying the foundation for the abstract generalization of algebra that would follow in the 19th century. All of this was left to us, in one paper, and some 60 pages of confused notes he mailed to a friend while he was in prison for his revolutionary and republican political activities. He would die in a duel, at the age of 20 in 1832, shortly after his release. reply mkw5053 3 hours agoprevA few years ago, I led a study group through A Book of Abstract Algebra by Charles C Pinter.

You are asking about 3D-space. The statement that you quoted tells you that you cannot distinguish between up and down in theory. Now, 2D-space is part of every 3D-space. There are multiple ways to see this. The easiest is to just drop the z-coordinate. Suppose you could distinguish left-handed and right-handed in 3D-space. In this case, you would have a way to distinguish up and down in the embedded 2D-space. However, you cannot do this distinction in 2D-space and therefore you cannot distinguish left-handed and right-handed in 3D-space. reply solveit 1 hour agoparentprevStack the vectors up so it's a matrix and take the determinant.

The determinant tells you whether two bases have the same or different handedness, not which one is \"left\" or \"right\". reply lanstin 47 minutes agorootparentIt's 2 cosets, one is arbitrarily left handed and the other arbitrarily right handed.

You can draw a picture for either answer. \"Left\" and \"right\" are a dipole. Neither one can exist without the other, and they are symmetric. It's the same issue as we have with the conjugates discussed in Galois Theory. In fact, in an algebraic (non-ordered/arithmetic/analytic) perspective, it's misleading to use the symbols + and - to label the conjugates in field extensions like sqrt2 and i. Left and Right are better names than + and - for those conjugate pairs. Only when we impose an arithmetic ordering (which is not needed in the theory of algebraic equalities) is it meaningful to use + and -: -sqrt(x)Did the solution taking 10 minutes make it seem like it was all just semantics from old faulty definitions? I recall that I, and the rest of the class, were very suspicious of the proof. The proof took maybe 10 minutes, but it probably took another 10-15 minutes for the professor to convince us there wasn't a logical error in the given proof. Though the situation was kind of the opposite of what you would thing. We understood field extensions and the symmetries of the roots of polynomials really well. What took convincing was that any formula using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and rational roots would always give you a field extension that mapped to a \"solvable group\". The proof is essentially: 1. Any field extension of a number constructed using those mathematical operations must map to a solvable group. 2. For every group there exists a corresponding field extension (this is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory). 3. There exist groups that are not solvable. 4. Therefore, there are polynomials with roots that can't be constructed from the elementary mathematical operations. Basically the entire course is dedicated to laying out part 3, and the part we were suspicious about was part 1. The one thing that is interesting about the proof is that it is actually partially constructive. Because there is no general quintic formula, but there are some quintics that are solvable. For instance, x^5 - 1 clearly has root x=1. And Galois theory allows you to tell the difference between those that are solvable and those that are not. It allows you to take any polynomial and calculate the group of symmetries of those roots. If that group is solvable, then all of the roots can be defined in terms of elementary operations. If not, at least one of the roots cannot. > How do you personally imagine trisecting an angle now? Is it possible to describe your new intuition of the impossibility in different human understandable terms that are also geometric? So the trisection proof I don't remember as well, but looking it up it isn't very geometric. It essentially proves that trisecting an angle with a compass and straight edge is equivalent to solving certain polynomial equations with certain operations, and goes into algebra. That said, Galois theory itself feels very \"geometric\" in the roughest sense of the term. Fundamentally, it's about classifying the symmetries of an object. reply kevinventullo 1 hour agorootparent2. For every group there exists a corresponding field extension (this is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory). Just a nit, but when talking about extensions of Q, this is called the Inverse Galois Problem and it is still an open problem. That said, you don’t actually need this strong of a statement to show general insolvability of the quintic. Rather you just need to exhibit a single extension of Q with non-solvable Galois group.

Galois theory is about \"The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory\", which states that there is a nice mapping from field-extensions to group-extensions, where the resulting groups are usually finite.

(There are also infinite fields other than the rationals, so 'in any field' does not just mean Galois fields/finite fields.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field Galois fields have nothing to do with being able to represent rational numbers in a computer: elements of a finite field aren't even rational numbers. reply koolala 1 hour agorootparentI can see how the idea extends naturally and also how it doesn't extend naturally.

Monads are LIFE! reply 082349872349872 55 minutes agorootparentEvery mathematical monad comes from an adjunction, which unfortunately implies they're not as windowless as Leibniz would like? (or does it merely imply that in the Leibnizian setting such an adjunction is always external and never internal?) Can we make a mathematical monad out of the adjunction presented above? Let g(C) be the minimum G and c(G) be the maximum C in the model above, then we certainly have g(C) = g(c(g(C))) and c(G) = c(g(c(G))), which formally suggest we may be able to do something. Exercise: does the triple (T, μ, η) exist? what about (G, δ, ϵ) in the other direction? If they do exist, what are they, for Aquinas, Leibniz, and Spinoza? reply 082349872349872 1 hour agoparentprev [–] To expand[0] upon that claim: Aquinas, Leibniz, and Spinoza all agree that there is a God (G) that created[1] a Creation (C) which we are a part of. One major way Aquinas (and Leibniz) differ from Spinoza is in how determinate C may be. Spinoza says C is determined by G; Aquinas says there are many possible C's for any given G. (Leibniz splits the difference and says there are many possible C's, but in our particular case, our G has created the best[2] possible C.) The reconciliation: let G and C be in an adjoint relationship, such that we have functions picking out the maximum C any given G may create, and the minimum G that can create any given C. Now, if you are Aquinas, G is omnipotent, and hence has the possibility to create other C's, but our C is the maximum[3] one. On the other hand, if you are Spinoza, G determines C[4], so it is trivially maximal. (The maximum of a singleton being the unique element) Does that make sense? Question: do there exist Gods that are incapable of creating any creation, or Creations that are impossible for any god to create? If so, need we replace \"maximum\" and \"minimum\" above by LUB and GLB? What other situations (eg. gods or creations being only domains rather than lattices) would also require further abstraction? :: :: :: [0] my apologies for any non-standard notation. I tried to find a survey paper on \"Algebraic Theology\" so I could follow the existing notation, but failed to find any concrete instances in this (currently only platonic?) field. [1] Spinoza is accused of \"pantheism\": the heresy of identifying God and the Creation. Reading him according to a Galois-theoretic model, he would be innocent of this heresy, for when he says \"God, or, the Universe\", he is simply using metonymy, for in his model God and Creation are dual, so (being in a 1:1 relationship) one determines the other. Note that in general, not only are duals not identical, they're not even isomorphic. [2] but cf Voltaire, Candide (1759) [3] if you are Leibniz, the order in which it is maximal corresponds to the traditional \"worst\" \"better\" \"best\" order. I don't know Leibniz well enough to say if he had a total, or only partial, order in mind; presumably in his model if there are several maximal \"best\" creations they would all be isomorphic? Exercise for the reader: work out the Leibnizian metaphysical adjunction. [4] turning this arrow around, C determines G, which explains why Einstein would say he believed in the \"God of Spinoza\", and chose to base his research by thinking about C, unlike the medieval colleagues of Aquinas, who spent a lot of time and effort trying to work the arrow in the other direction, hoping to come to conclusions about C in starting by thinking about G. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

So I've created sqlean-time — a high-precision date/time extension with a structured API and a rich set of functions. Note. Adding extensions to SQLite is a breeze. Download a file, run one database command — and you are good to go. Concepts • Creating values • Extracting fields • Unix time • Time comparison • Time arithmetic • Rounding • Formatting • Acknowledgements • Installation and usage Concepts This extension works with two types of values: Time and Duration. Time since within 0-time second ┌─────────┬─────────────┐ │ seconds │ nanoseconds │ └─────────┴─────────────┘ 64 bit 32 bit Time is a pair (seconds, nanoseconds), where seconds is the 64-bit number of seconds since zero time (0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) and nanoseconds is the number of nanoseconds within the current second (0-999999999). For maximum flexibility, you can store time values in their internal representation (a 13-byte BLOB). This allows you to represent dates for billions of years in the past and future with nanosecond precision. Alternatively, you can store time values as a NUMBER (64-bit integer) of seconds (milli-, micro- or nanoseconds) since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC). In this case, the range of representable dates depends on the unit of time used: Seconds: billions of years into the past or future with second precision. Milliseconds: 292 million years before or after 1970 with millisecond precision. Microseconds: years from -290307 to 294246 with microsecond precision. Nanoseconds: years from 1678 to 2262 with nanosecond precision. Time is always stored and operated in UTC, but you can convert it from/to a specific timezone offset. Duration ┌─────────────┐ │ nanoseconds │ └─────────────┘ 64 bit Duration is a 64-bit number of nanoseconds, so it can represent values up to about 290 years. You can store duration values as NUMBER.

And computerphile explains so well in their 10-min video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY --- I've long ago learned to never build my own Date/Time nor Encryption libraries. There's endless edge cases that can bite you hard. (Which is also why I'm skeptical when I encounter new such libraries) reply sltkr 5 hours agoparentThis library doesn't deal with the notion of local time at all. It's all UTC-based times, possibly with a user-supplied timezone offset, but then the hard part of calculating the timezone offset must be done by the caller. I do think the documentation could be a little clearer. The author talks about “time zones” but the library only deals with time zone offsets. (A time zone is something like America/New_York, while a time zone offset is the difference to UTC time, which is -14400 seconds for New York today, but will be -18000 in a few months due to daylight saving time changes.) reply akira2501 15 minutes agorootparent> A time zone is something like America/New_York It's US/Eastern. Paul Eggert can call this a \"deprecated compatibility time\" all he wants, but \"Eastern Time Zone\" is the official name of the time zone as maintained by the civil time keeping authority. reply Someone 1 hour agorootparentprev> It's all UTC-based times Not even that. UTC has leap seconds, which this code doesn’t handle (FTA: “The calendrical calculations always assume a Gregorian calendar, with no leap seconds”) It copies that from the golang time package, which makes the same claim (https://pkg.go.dev/time) That makes life a lot simpler for the implementer, but doesn’t that mean you can only reliably use these two libraries for computing with durations, not with moments in time or vice versa? The moment you start mapping these times to real world clocks and adding durations to them, you run the risk of getting small (up to about half a minute, at the moment) inconsistencies. reply doctorpangloss 40 minutes agorootparentAnother POV is, why build for the SQLite \"ecosystem\" at all? reply nalgeon 4 hours agorootparentprevThanks for the suggestion! True, only fixed offsets are supported, not timezone names. reply alberth 1 hour agorootparent@nalgeon Do you plan to address the use cases in the SO post, or asked differently - what is the intended use case of this library? I tried to recreate it on your site (which is very cool btw in allowing the code to run in browser) and it seems to fail and give the wrong time difference. select time_compare(time_date(1927, 12, 31, 23, 58, 08, 0, 28800000), time_date(1927, 12, 31, 23, 58, 09, 0, 28800000)); Results in an answer of '1', which is incorrect.

The time rollback only happened in Asia/Shanghai. reply nalgeon 1 hour agorootparentprevI appreciate your comments, and thank you for trying out the extension. This query returns -1 (minus one, not one), which seems correct to me.

More confusing is that there's pretty extreme time granularity, but only ±290 years range with nanosecond precision for time durations? reply michaelt 1 hour agoparent> what possible use case would need nanosecond precision over a span of billions of years? Once you've decided you're using nanosecond precision, a 64-bit representation can only cover 584 years which ain't enough. You really want at least 2 more bits, so you can represent 2024 years. But once you're adding on 2 bits, why not just add on 16 or even 32? Then your library can cover the needs of everyone from people calculating how it takes light to travel 30cm, to people calculating the age of the universe. That's how I imagine the design decisions went, anyway :) Of course you can't really provide sub-second accuracy without leapsecond support and what does pre-human-civilisation leapsecond support even mean? reply nalgeon 5 hours agoparentprevIt works very well for me and thousands of other Go developers. That's why I chose this approach. reply g15jv2dp 4 hours agorootparentThere's no reason it wouldn't \"work\", the question is \"why\". Having such precise dates obviously comes with some compromises (e.g., the representation is larger, or it's variable depending on the value which comes with additional complexity, etc.). So surely there must be some pros to counterbalance the cons. \"Because it's what Go does\" is an answer, but I don't know if it's a convincing one. reply nalgeon 4 hours agorootparentnext [4 more] [flagged] g15jv2dp 4 hours agorootparentWTF.

But honestly, after reading the initial comment, I'm not interested in engaging in any way whatsoever with this person. reply goldfishgold 2 hours agorootparentprevThere's nothing in the linked blog post justifying why you might want a higher precision time. In fact the blog post would benefit from an explanation that outlines the current datetimes in sqlite and why they're insufficient. reply marcellus23 4 hours agorootparentprevI think you're being overly defensive. The GP is curious about the decisions you made, and just asking questions in a bit of a blunt (but not rude or accusatory) style that's typical for HN. edit: the comment I'm responding to was much more vitriolic, it's since been edited reply bongodongobob 2 hours agorootparentprevNice. Smoking cigarettes works for me and millions of others but it's still stupid and will take years or decades of your life. reply davidhyde 6 hours agoprevI think it’s important to be explicit about whether or not signed integers are used. From reading the document it seems that they may be signed but they could not be. If they are signed then you could have multiple bit strings that represent the same date and time which is not great. reply jagged-chisel 6 hours agoparentDefinitely signed - “use negative duration to subtract” But bit pattern is an issue internal to the library. If you can find a bug in the code, certainly point it out and offer a fix if it’s in your skillset. reply sigseg1v 6 hours agorootparentI think the negative number here refers to the amount of days/etc to subtract (eg. add negative days to subtract, not supply a negative date). However, at the same time it seems to indicate that it stores data using sqlites built in number type, which to my understanding does not support unsigned? Secondly, the docs mention you can store with a range of 290 years and the precision is nanoseconds, which if you calculate it out works out to about 63 bits of information, suggesting a signed implementation. reply tyingq 5 hours agorootparentYes, it's signed...https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html Each value stored in an SQLite database (or manipulated by the database engine) has one of the following storage classes: # some omitted... INTEGER. The value is a signed integer, stored in 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value. reply gcr 5 hours agorootparentprevSubtraction of unsigned negative values still works just fine because of two’s compliment. (uint8)(-3) is 253, for example, and (uint8)5-(uint8)253 = (uint8)8, corresponding to 5 - (-3) reply kaoD 1 hour agoparentprev> multiple bit strings that represent the same date and time How so? reply simontheowl 6 hours agoprevVery cool - definitely an important missing feature in SQlite. reply cryptonector 4 hours agoprevI so wish that SQLite3 had an extensible type system. reply funny_falcon 1 hour agoparentAs a PostgreSQL smallish contributor I just can say: NO, DON'T DO THIS!!!! Extensible type system is a worst thing that could happend with database end-user performance. Then one may not short-cut no single thing in query parsing and optimization: you must check type of any single operand, find correct operator implemenation, find correct index operator family/class and many more all through querying system catalog. And input/output of values are also goes through the functions, stored in system catalog. You may not even answer to \"select 1\" without consulting with system catalog. There should be sane set of builtin types + struct/json like way of composition. That is like most DBs do except PostgreSQL. And I strongly believe it is right way. reply quotemstr 4 hours agoprevRelated tangent: databases should track units. If I have a time column, I should be able to say a column represents, say, durations in float64 seconds. Then I should be able to write SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE duration_s >= 2h and have the database DWIM, converting \"2h\" to 7200.0 seconds and comparing like-for-like during the table scan. Years ago, I wrote a special-purpose SQL database that had this kind of native unit handling, but I've seen nothing before or since, and it seems like a gap in the UI ecosystem. And it shouldn't be for time. We should have the whole inventory of units --- mass, volume, information, temperature, and so on. Why not? We can also teach the database to reject mathematical nonsense, e.g. SELECT 2h + 15kg -- type error! Doing so would go a long way towards catching analysis errors early. reply zokier 3 hours agoparentPostgresql interval units allow already querying with natural-like expressions: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.ht... reply n_plus_1_acc 1 hour agoparentprevWhat about leap seconds? reply quotemstr 1 hour agorootparentThe leap second mechanism amounts to a collective agreement to rewrite chronological history. It's like a git rebase for your clock. Everyone (almost) in practice does math as if leap seconds never happened, and the consequent divergence from physical time ends up not mattering. reply lifeisstillgood 4 hours agoprevThis is a sort of lazy but in your experience, what is more useful / valuable - nanosecond representation, or years outside the nano range of something like 1678-2200 I don't do \"proper\" science so the value of nanoseconds seems limited to very clever experiments (or some financial trade tracking that is probalby even more limited in scope). But being able to represent historical dates seems more likely to come up? Thoughts? reply cyberax 4 hours agoparentHistorical dates, for sure. Simply reducing the precision to 10ns will provide enough range in practice. reply rokkamokka 3 hours agoparentprevA bit like asking if a hammer or a screwdriver is more useful. It depends on the work reply zokier 6 hours agoprevI just wish people would stop using the phrase \"seconds since epoch\" (or equivalent) unless that is exactly what they mean. I wonder what does select time_sub(time_date(2011, 11, 19), time_date(1311, 11, 18)); return? reply ralferoo 5 hours agoparentWhy do you wish that? I can think of a few plausible reasons, but the only one that is really significant is \"what epoch\"? In the case of UNIX-based systems and systems that try to mimic that behaviour, that is well defined. But as you haven't said what your complaints are, it's hard to provide any counterpoint or justification for why things are as they are. > time_date(1311, 11, 18) That isn't defined in the epoch used by most computer systems, so all bets are off. Perhaps it'll return MAX_INT, MIN_INT, 0, something that's plausible but doesn't take into calendar reforms that have no bearing on the epoch being used, or perhaps it translates into a different epoch and calculates the exact number of seconds, or anything else. One could even argue that there are no valid epochs before GMT/UTC because it was all just local time before then. But of course, you can argue either way whether -ve values should be supported. Exactly 24 hours before 1970-1-1 0:00:00 UTC could be reasonably expected to be -86400, on the other hand \"since\" strongly implies positive only. Other people might have entirely different epochs for different reasons, again within the domain it's being used, that's fine as long as everyone agrees. Or did you have some other objection? reply zokier 4 hours agorootparentThe problem with \"seconds since epoch\" expression is that almost always it doesn't mean literally seconds since epoch, but instead some unix-style monstrosity. And it's annoying that you need to read some footnote to figure out what exactly it means; it's annoying that it is basically a code-phrase that you just need to know that it's not supposed to be taken literally. reply ralferoo 3 hours agorootparent> it doesn't mean literally seconds since epoch, but instead some unix-style monstrosity That \"unix-style monstrosity\" is literally seconds since the UNIX time epoch, which is unambiguously defined as starting on 1970-1-1 0:00:00 UTC. Or it would have been, had leap seconds not been forced upon the world in 1972, at which point yes, arguably it's no longer \"physical earth seconds\" since the epoch but \"UNIX seconds\" where a day is defined as exactly 86400 UNIX seconds. In retrospect, it'd have been better if UNIX time was exactly a second, and the leap seconds accounted for by the tz database, but that didn't exist until over a decade after the first leap seconds were added, so probably everybody thought it was easier just to take the pragmatic option to skip the missing seconds, exactly the same way that the rest of the world was doing. I'm still not sure if that's what your complaint is about, as I don't know of time systems defined any other way handle this correctly if you were to ask for the time difference in seconds between a time before and after a leap second. Maybe a better question would be: what do you think would be a better way of defining a representation of a date and time, and that would allow for easy calculations and also easy transformations into how it's presented for users? reply edflsafoiewq 2 hours agorootparentYou literally did the exact thing GP is complaining about. reply fluoridation 2 hours agorootparentIt's unclear if that's what they're complaining about, but if it is, the reason people just say \"seconds since epoch\" instead of saying what they actually mean is precisely because no one wants to get into the weeds of leap seconds. POSIX timestamps are a convenient format and they represent an idealized \"second\" of constant length that's in a uniform correspondence with the rotation of the Earth. Most likely if you're using such a representation you won't care that 1723740711 is not literally and exactly 1723740711 seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z and the error of a few seconds will not even be noticed. reply edflsafoiewq 1 hour agorootparentNo, that is literally exactly what they just complained about. > And it's annoying that you need to read some footnote to figure out what exactly it means; it's annoying that it is basically a code-phrase that you just need to know that it's not supposed to be taken literally. Even to point of deferring the real explanation to a secondary paragraph. reply fluoridation 52 minutes agorootparentI mean if they're referring specifically to leap seconds or to some other obscure complexity about dealing with real time. reply ralferoo 2 hours agorootparentprevAgain, the same question: what would be a better solution? reply nalgeon 5 hours agoparentprev> If the result exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a Duration, the maximum duration will be returned. reply out_of_protocol 5 hours agoprev [–] Why not go golang style, unix timestamp as nanoseconds, in signed int64. Maybe you can't cover millions of years with nanosecond precision, do you really need it? reply commodoreboxer 4 hours agoparentWith that precision and size, you can only cover the years from 1678 to 2262, which strongly limits your ability to represent historical dates and times. reply azornathogron 2 hours agorootparentIf you're representing dates back into the 1600s you need to keep in mind that calendar maths and things like \"was this year a leap year\" become more complicated. The Gregorian calendar was introduced in the 1500s but worldwide adoption took a long time - for example, the UK didn't adopt it until the 1700s. So you've got more than a century where just having \"a date\" isn't really sufficient information to know when something happened, you'll need to also know what calendar system that date is in. Overall, this means if you're representing historical dates I would question whether a seconds-since-epoch timestamp representation is what you want at all, regardless of range and precision. Edit: yes, you can kinda handle this as part of handling timezones, but still, it's complicated enough that you may want to retain more or different information if you're displaying or letting users enter historical dates. reply out_of_protocol 2 hours agorootparentprev> represent historical dates and times. With nanosecond precision? Just decide what you want to do beforehand, i bet even datetime don't make much sense for that time period, bare date would suffice. also, you'll likely need location, calendar system etc since real dates were not that standardized back then reply nalgeon 4 hours agoparentprev [–] Storing unix timestamp as nanoseconds is not Go's style, but you can do just that with this extension. select time_to_nano(time_now()); -- 1722979335431295000 reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "commentBody": "CockroachDB License Change (cockroachlabs.com)174 points by Cwizard 4 hours agohidepastfavorite211 comments AYBABTME 4 hours agoI understand the goal, and the perceived abuse of the Core edition. But the problem with the Enterprise edition is that it's quite expensive, \"contact us\" salesy, and it feels like taking a bite of this edition is possibly getting into bed with a future Oracle/landlord type of relationship where you end up squeezed by your database vendor. The Core offering made this palatable, one could fallback to Core features if the relationship with Cockroach Labs degraded, which made it possible to entertain the Enterprise license since there's was a way to walk back from it. But now there's no such mitigation available. By using non-PG native features, users of the Enterprise edition are accepting to get in bed with Cockroach Labs for effectively forever (databases), a single provider that has no competition. I think this may backfire, as it now seems imprudent to go all in on Cockroach Labs. They may be nice folks today, but who knows who will run the place in 5y when the next round of squeeze comes? I wish them the best, they're a great team and I always liked the project and toyed with it for years, and currently am involved with a paid Enterprise license. But this change in the dynamics is really giving me pause. Getting in bed with a single vendor for an incredibly sticky tool comes with a _lot_ of risk. It took at least 17y for Amazon to get rid of its last Oracle database: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/migration-complete-amazons-... reply andrewmutz 4 hours agoparentIt seems that whenever an open source project is run by a VC-backed company, it sooner or later ends up like this. Increasingly it seems that \"open source\" is just the teaser to get people interested and then when investors want revenue growth, the rug gets pulled. IMO, it's not really open source if its run by a company that will eventually use its position to squeeze its users for cash. reply jaaron 1 hour agorootparent> IMO, it's not really open source if its run by a company that will eventually use its position to squeeze its users for cash. I know it's not as popular or sexy as it used to be, but the whole point of a foundation like Apache was to avoid these situations, even more than the way the Linux Foundation is setup. Apache _explicitly_ manages projects to avoid these downsides. - Single corporation ownership. Projects cannot get out of the Incubator unless they demonstrate a diverse and healthy community. That doesn't mean popular, it doesn't necessarily mean best-in-class, but it means that there shouldn't be just one entity backing a project. - Membership in Apache is _personal_ not a seat for a given company. If you're a committer on an Apache project and you move jobs, you're _still_ a committer on that project - The Foundation owns the trademarks. There have been fights about this in the past, but the whole idea is that the _community_ owns the name, so some corporation can't claim to be the sole or official owner by naming their company or product after the open source product. The core premise of the Apache Software Foundation is community over code, that healthy, diverse communities have a better chance of standing the test of time than open source projects backed by a single individual or company. That's the thesis at least. The is starkly different from several other foundations, notably the Linux Foundation or Eclipse Foundation which are modeled more around industry consortiums. Both models have their place, but I believe Apache better models the core values many of us feel strongly about when it comes to free and open source software. reply haolez 2 hours agorootparentprevOld(?) school open source with GPL licenses doesn't seem to suffer from this, on a first glance. Maybe Stallman was right. Would love to hear from someone more knowledgeable on this. I'm not trying to troll. reply lucianbr 21 minutes agorootparentMaybe? Every day it seems clearer that Stallman is right. Mouse subscription? Windows displaying ads in start menu and recording everything you do? How many devices have become useless when the servers shot down, or games became unplayable? How many times books or songs or movies have disappeared from \"online collections\" after being paid for? \"The right to read\" seems more and more realistic as time passes. In my opinion, Stallman has been proven right many times over. reply omoikane 1 hour agorootparentprevOld school open source projects don't seem particularly profitable. The projects themselves might thrive, but that seem to rely on altruistic developers with other sources of income. Richard Stallman himself doesn't seem to make money from any software he made directly, but from various grants and such, for example: https://web.archive.org/web/20220123032418/http://tech.mit.e... I thought he was on the payroll for FSF, but his reportable compensation has been zero from 2002 to 2022 according to: https://www.fsf.org/about/financial reply wussboy 10 minutes agorootparent> Old school open source projects don't seem particularly profitable. And is also subject to survivorship bias. For every OSS project that makes it, tens of thousands do not. reply ghshephard 1 hour agorootparentprevGPL is actually a great license for this scenario. The software advances to a particular level of development, inertia, market penetration - then the company that owns the software dual licenses with GPLv3 - which no company can risk to have on their premise, distribute, or use/touch, etc... - ergo you then have to pay for a commercial license to avoid the GPLv3 taint. reply nsm 2 hours agorootparentprevYep! I actually far prefer closed source software, made by non-VC funded companies, where there business is to create good software that actually adds value for the license I'm paying for. Something like Sublime Text or JetBrains. Surecan have people spend years of their life working on something, but release it as open source because VCs are paying for it, and that leads to more mindshare, but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Similar reasons to not use VSCode (commoditizing the complement by using billions of dollars from other products). The \"must be open source (I think they actually mean free as in $$) at all costs\" crowd baffles me because the money to support the humans creating the software in the real world doesn't just magically appear. reply ElijahLynn 43 minutes agorootparentI'm imagining that those closed source softwares wouldn't be possible without open source libraries and tools... reply karmakaze 2 hours agorootparentprevOpensource is opensource: CockroachDB Core up until Nov 24, 2024 is, and not afterward. Anyone who wants to fork it can do so. Mind you this will be a hard fork as there's no way to keep in sync with their enterprise product. What you say is true in that you shouldn't view a VC backed opensource offering as 'permanently' opensource by the same group. reply nazka 15 minutes agorootparentWhat happens the day where the only way to fork it realistically is to pay people. And I mean good people to even keep up? And what if on top of that the bests in the game are already in the corporations that you want to fork from? reply geenat 2 hours agorootparentprevKind of... Certain extensions such as basic backups are closed source and have never been in the OSS version. Many things would have to be re-added from scratch in a fork. reply a-robinson 1 hour agorootparent\"Basic\" (i.e. full) backups have been included in the OSS version since its November 2020 release (20.2): https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/backup-restore/ They are still pretty limited compared to what's in the enterprise version, but it's not right to say basic backups are closed source and have never been there. reply karmakaze 1 hour agorootparentprevI'm having trouble parsing/making sense of this. Was basic backup in Core? If you were running anything more than Core you weren't running an OSS version and had already crossed that line before this announcement. If you were running an OSS version there's nothing to add, just fork, no? reply gerwim 46 minutes agorootparentCore only has the \"full backup\". Incremental and other types are available to enterprise. I run the Core edition (with full backups) for my personal projects. reply jen20 1 hour agorootparentprevCockroachDB Core has not been offered under an OSI (i.e. Open Source) license since 2019 - everything subsequently has either been under Business Source License or the Cockroach Community License. reply candiddevmike 4 hours agorootparentprevLike other folks have said, anytime you see a CLA, you see the true intentions of the project. A project that will always be FOSS won't have a need for a CLA. reply _benedict 3 hours agorootparentThe ASF requires a CLA for all regular contributors or large contributions, so I don’t think this is a particularly good barometer. reply remram 3 hours agorootparentThat's a good point. The ASF's FAQ [1] states that \"All software developed by all projects of The Apache Software Foundation is freely available without charge\" and that it \"is specified in the Foundation's Articles of Incorporation [2]\", however I see no such specification in the linked incorporation. Is there some actual legal guarantee there? [1]: https://www.apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html#IsItFree [2]: https://www.apache.org/foundation/records/incorporator.html reply fweimer 3 hours agorootparentI think it's mentioned in this document: https://www.apache.org/foundation/records/certificate.html reply remram 2 hours agorootparentThanks! It seems a little short of the claim in their FAQ though, but it's something: > The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity [...] including the creation and maintenance of \"open source\" software distributed by the Corporation to the public at no charge reply ted_dunning 2 hours agorootparentI don't think that falls short. The reason for the \"any lawful act\" language is to allow the ASF to do things like run a conference, accept donations, sell t-shirts and other activities. If the statement was only \"develop open-source software\" there are all kinds of important activities that support open source development that would be impossible. The fact is, however, that certificates can be changed by the people who can vote. IN the case of the ASF, the members are the ones who vote. Getting those ~800 members to radically trash the traditional goal of the foundation is not going to be possible as long as the current membership is active. reply saurik 3 hours agorootparentprevThe difference with the ASF/FSF is that they are non-profits with a mission statement (and, if we don't trust that enough--due to OpenAI, as I don't entirely understand what happened there--with clearly-mission-aligned board leadership) that prevent them from pulling the rug out from under their license. (...and, right as I pushed this comment, I see that someone else looked into it, and maybe the ASF fails to have such a clause anywhere ;P but hopefully it is there and just a bit hidden.) reply cortesoft 3 hours agorootparentSure, but that contradicts the statement made in the comment they are replying to: > anytime you see a CLA, you see the true intentions of the project. A project that will always be FOSS won't have a need for a CLA. If there are conditions to the statement, it isn't \"anytime you see a CLA\". reply saurik 2 hours agorootparentSure, but now we would need to find another epicycle for why giving a for-profit corporation this dangerous power over its licensees is safe/benign. There is, at times, some logic to \"the exception that proves the rule\". reply fweimer 3 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on the CLA. In some countries, you cannot not have a CLA because there's always an implied contract. Many CLAs are just a hassle (basically, DCO that has to be reviewed by the legal department). But a lot are asymmetrical in a substantial way and the original developer gets to play by different rules than the rest. CLAs in the second category tend to be problematic. Even that is not a completely clear indicator because in some cases, the asymmetry is only intended to help with potential future relicensing in alignment with the project's goals, and not to enable commercialization (either today or at some point in the future). Some organizations have resisted direct commercialization of the code they have been entrusted with for decades, so that can happen even with an asymmetrical CLA. reply kodablah 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is not necessarily true. Sometimes it's needed to pivot to a better/different open source license without going through the pain of contacting every contributor ever. I have seen that pain in some projects that want to go from LGPL to MIT or something. For many contributors, they're ok giving full ownership of their contributions to a project owner on the owner's terms. Some contributors may not be ok with that of course, but it doesn't mean that every project owner has nefarious plans with said code ownership. reply drdaeman 1 hour agorootparent> better/different open source license And that's why \"open source\" is a really bad term that no one should use unironically, unless they want to confuse the hell out of people. There are protective (copyleft) licenses, and there are permissive licenses - and they're very different beasts. And it's, like, software licensing 101. > that want to go from LGPL to MIT or something I find this extremely weird. In a sane world, picking a copyleft license must mean that you care about user freedoms and want to make sure they're respected no matter what happens. Because that's the whole point of picking a copyleft license - not about letting people peek or tweak some code, not about social brownie points, and most certainly not about marketing campaigns - but about granting users their freedoms. Either people get confused about \"open source\" and pick... I don't know, whatever looks cool, without even understanding what they're doing; or they're giving up on their principles when they smell the money. I can understand wanting to go from, say, GPL to AGPL, or GPLv2 to GPLv3[+] - it would make sense, as it all goes in line of protecting freedoms. But LGPL to MIT is truly a weird one. reply ziddoap 2 hours agorootparentprevFor those of us not in-the-know about licensing acronyms. CLA = Contributor License Agreement reply orthecreedence 1 hour agorootparentprevI think that's a bit reductive. It's possible to have a CLA because you want to sell a non-GPL version of your app to some corporation that's worried about the legalities of the license. This is an additional revenue stream that open-source projects make use of, and it's not fair to say \"any project with a CLA is selling out.\" There's this balance between being a project forever run out of someone's garage and actually growing into a larger and more used system. I'd say the line is dilineated by many factors: who is the project's primary user? Enterprise? Devs? How much money is changing hands? What's the business model? Is there investment involved? How restrictive is the primary license? How restrictive is the CLA? I think any open-source project that has aspirations to actually make money for the creators is shooting themselves in the foot without a CLA. And it's fine to judge them for this, but we live in a system where people have to extract value out of this shit even if it's against their ethos. If people truly and ultimately believe in open-source, then the most logical conclusion is that capitalism does not allow for open source and that must be changed. Fighting things at the license level can only delay the inevitable. But people want to have their cake and eat it too: \"I want the system to stay the same AND I want open-source creators to keep pumping out stuff for free forever.\" reply JohnDeHope 3 hours agorootparentprevMaybe we will have to replace \"open source\" with \"spec driven\". As you point out, open source can be just as bad as closed source, given future changes in direction by the project team. But \"spec driven\" means that anybody can come along and compete, and you can switch to them, regardless of how the original developers feel about it. reply graemep 2 hours agorootparentIs it not more about who does the development? If cone entity does the development, they can change direction or licensing and it is hard for anyone to fork. If you have more of a bazaar form of development with many contributors neither is as easy (even less so if you do not have a CLA). Even if you have a small core team of developers, a really bad direction is likely to lead to a split. reply evantbyrne 2 hours agorootparentI think you are right to think of it in terms of who is doing development. The plus of a non open-source license is well-funded development. The downside is fewer outside contributions. In this specific instance, I think Cockroach was BSL? So, it can be forked into a community project where new contributions are open-source. Another corporation just wouldn't be able to profiteer off the fork directly until the changeover date. reply acedTrex 3 hours agorootparentprevOpen source and profit go together like oil and water reply yawboakye 4 hours agorootparentprevstart open/source available has become a trend among yc-backed startups lately. one wonders how long before a “well, actually, we need a business-y license.” reply brianwawok 3 hours agorootparentLately? This was cool like 12 years ago. Then you turn commercial once you get enough users. It’s the open source chameleon model. reply jzb 4 hours agoparentprevThis is one of the reasons people should hold the line for open source licensing for any infrastructure software: Any licensing scheme that forces a relationship with a single entity / doesn't allow for forking is open to abuse of users and customers at some point. reply zeeg 2 hours agoparentprevYou have nailed their issues - packaging and their revenue model. If you align this well with your target audience the license would have not been a problem for them. Wrote about this a bit here: https://cra.mr/open-source-is-not-a-business-model/ reply ROFISH 4 hours agoparentprevAgreed. I talked with them in the past and the pricing was far too expensive to make it worth it. As always: “If you have to ask, you can’t afford it.” reply JohnDeHope 3 hours agoparentprev> They may be nice folks today, but who knows who will run the place in 5y when the next round of squeeze comes? The same idea applies to political questions. A politician I like is proposing a policy I approve of. Great! Now what happens in the next election cycle, when a politician I don't like gets to use that same power to do something I don't approve of? Woops. reply nickpsecurity 3 hours agorootparentWe can vote for different politicians after a few years. The politicians can vote to remove laws that were problems. There’s a straight-forward solution to that. Building critical features on a single, closed-standard database means you can’t leave unless you rewrite all code that relied on it. The new code must integrate in the system well. The change must also happen without taking down the business.

They released software under a specific license (BSL at that, plenty of opportunities to restrict). reply AYBABTME 4 hours agorootparentIt can be construed as \"abuse\" if another commercial entity is deriving value from the core license while Cockroach Labs doesn't get to enjoy a \"fair\" share of this created value, while pouring its own resources into a product that enables this value creation. I think CR Labs needs to make money from their activities. However they do it, should be in a way that incentivizes a win-win for them and their customers. Right now I think they attempted to \"correct\" for the uncaptured value, but the game theory switched toward discouraging adoption (in my perspective). I may be wrong, probably am. reply jillesvangurp 2 hours agoprevThat's another company that feels like they don't want to be an OSS company after all. After Elastic, I pay more attention to contributor agreements. Basically I consider any project that requires transfer of copyright for OSS contributions as likely to change their license at some point. It's fine; I'm not against that sort of thing and I sometimes pay for software. But I like to know what I'm getting into before and I don't appreciate the bait and switch. It also guides decisions as to what I contribute to actively. I do a simple sanity check with any OSS software before using it: - Make sure there is no contributor agreement requirements. This is a gigantic red flag that the license can and probably will be changed at some point. - Make sure the license is not overly restrictive (like AGPL). I appreciate people have good reasons for picking this license; but it comes with some serious restrictions in a commercial environment. And like it or not, a lot of companies have active policies against this. Either way, I avoid anything with this license. - Make sure the project is actively maintained. You don't want to get stuck with unmaintained software. Replacing dependencies is a PITA. - Make sure the project is not overly dependent on VC funding. Startups fail all the time at which point anything they worked on turns into abandon ware. - Ideally, make sure the project has a healthy diverse group of committers. Healthy here means more than one company is involved. Most projects that fail one or more of the above tests usually aren't very healthy in this sense. reply bityard 2 hours agoparentCockroachDB hasn't been an open source project in more than 5 years.

It's what makes Linux completely bullet proof against license changes. You'd have to track down every copyright holder (everyone that contributed, even if it's just a 1 line change) to get their permission for re-licensing their contribution. Which in the case of Linux is literally tens of thousands of individuals and companies, if not more. reply aseipp 4 minutes agorootparentNo, the FSF specifically requires ownership transfer for GNU projects, so that they can do things like go after infringements in court, or relicense GNU projects to newer versions of the GPL unconditionally, e.g. when GPLv3 was released. Ironically, CLAs like the one Google and Meta use for their projects on GitHub do not require ownership transfer -- only the rights to redistribute, because the prevailing Lawyer-brain belief is (roughly, to my understanding) that just assuming that right from the license itself isn't necessarily sound. For projects that are licensed under e.g. Apache-2.0, assignment/ownership is a kind of irrelevant practical distinction because entities can just distribute proprietary versions anyway (and because it's not clear if you really agree to much more than e.g. Apache 2.0 implies), which is the prevailing worry people have. Most of the people here actually want GPL-style copyleft licenses, even if they don't know it. Because that's the only way to achieve the practical desired outcome, where your code and contributions stay open and are difficult to \"rework\" in this way. The talk about CLAs and all the other stuff is irrelevant; it's a matter of the politics and composition of the project, not the exact legal words in the license. > everyone that contributed, even if it's just a 1 line change This is also wrong. There is a concept called the \"threshold of originality\" which states roughly that some obvious, trivial things just can't be copyrighted. Your typofix patch that changed \"form\" to \"from\" isn't meaningful enough to be given copyright, so you literally do not need to be consulted on the matter at all. It is not clear that simple bugfixes fit under this definition for example. They could also just not include your patch too or rewrite it, in that case, so the \"1 line\" case is meaningless. It's really funny how many people on this site are so totally wrong about basic facts of the matter in multiple ways. But then again, it wouldn't be Hacker News if you weren't! reply arp242 2 hours agorootparentprevMost GNU projects require a copyright assignment. For example, GNU coreutils: \"note that non trivial changes require copyright assignment to the FSF as detailed in the “Copyright Assignment” section of the Coreutils HACKING notes.\" (from: https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils). As far as I know, this is case for most GNU projects.

They want to have standing in court so they can defend infringers, and that's materially easier to establish with copyright assignment agreements. https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.en.html So while I agree with other commenters that a CLA is a clear indication that the entity seeking to have copyright assigned wants to reserve the right to take some kind of legal action at some point (like changing the license), it also applies in cases where the legal action is benevolent rather than malevolent (like defending the copyright). reply orra 2 hours agoparentprev> That's another company that feels like they don't want to be an OSS company after all TBH that's nothing new for Cockroach.

For example, planetscale charges 3x as much per gb of storage if I read the pricing correctly. reply samlambert 3 hours agorootparentwe charge per node and you get 3 nodes by default so it’s not 3x it’s just that you have more nodes. reply vvern 2 hours agorootparentCockroach is also doing 3x replication of the data, so I don’t think that’s particularly relevant here. Cockroach serverless will dynamically scale up sql serving processes based on load. The storage and compute are separated in the cockroach architecture. My point is that if your query load is relatively low, cockroach serverless is definitely cheaper because the storage costs dominate. I think there’s ambiguity on which product is cheaper for a real-world application with meaningful load and data size.

It's an honor system, and even they admit it [0]; even Unity, who also uses a revenue-based model, admits it [1]. I'd prefer licensing models that are able to automatically segment users into customers at the software-level, such as a feature-based or usage-based model. For example, they could segment on CPU count or disk size, requiring an Enterprise offering for databases or clusters over a certain threshold. But completely doing away with Core and requiring license keys even for free users [2] (which I assume is for revenue auditing purposes) ... I feel like that's a big step backwards. All of this because their Enterprise offering seemingly wasn't valuable enough (or from the comments -- it was too expensive). I'd of focused there, on making Enterprise more valuable or more accessible, instead of doing something this drastic. AFAICT, they're also doing away with BUSL and DOSP [3], which is a big bummer.

On the other hand, open source is supposed to help build a bigger pie. If the pie gets bigger faster (i.e. more people using CockroachDB) then is the recapture worth it?

The issue here is that if you're an org with less than $10M turnover, you're currently on the Core plan and don't want to negotiate the full \"Enterprise\" licence (which is presumably priced towards larger users than you anyway), then you can't use the thing at all anymore unless you agree to telemetry and some vague disclosure of personal data thing that will get your lawyers in a spin (especially if you serve states in which GDPR applies).

Does it perform significantly better to justify the cost? Back in the day I worked heavily with databases and we always tilted towards open source. reply zellyn 2 hours agoparentFor most databases (like Postgres), you typically run a single database (per shard, possibly), and replicate changes to a live read-only backup as fast as possible. If the live R/W database fails, you quickly switch the backup to R/W, and point traffic there instead. Then, there's a class of databases that tries to actively commit across multiple geographies. You pay a cost (in terms of latency, and typically also $$$), but when a commit succeeds, it has been written durably and reliably, using some consensus protocol, across multiple geographies. The exemplar is probably Spanner, which uses atomic clocks to get very specific about time to narrow the latency gap as much as possible. Cockroach is broadly in the same class, although without atomic clocks I believe it's using network roundtrip measurements and/or some kind of mathematical time abstraction (like counters of come kind) to do the same thing. Can't ever be quite as fast, but you don't need atomic clocks! What's _really_ funny is when people start out choosing Spanner because of its global replication, then decide it's too expensive, and settle on regional non-replicated Spanner DBs to save cost. Like, that's just a database, man. (Or maybe something slightly above a single database, like Aurora replicated across Availability Zones in the same Region). Other folks can chime in, but there are a growing number of databases in this class. TiDB I believe is one. I _thought_ PlanetScale was just sharded mysql (Vitess+MySQL = clever auto-(re-)sharding), but perhaps it does replicated writes too - I see it getting mentioned here a bunch. reply 999900000999 2 hours agorootparentAssuming I need to host on prem, do any fully open source solutions exist for this .

Presumably only a small subset of postgres users really need this feature - and those that do, are big enough to need an enterprise licence. reply 999900000999 3 hours agorootparentI'll admit I haven't worked directly in this space in a good while, but the whole mystery terms really rubs me the wrong way . For example if I have a company that provisions databases on behalf of my clients, is this 10 million revenue cap for my company, or for the clients themselves . The pricing isn't even on the website for self hosting, I presume it's one of those if you need to ask you can't afford it type situations. Plus you're locking yourself into a vendor that has no worries about changing its terms again later on. >Required only during the trial period.

    "originBody": "Software Apps Browsing Google pulls the plug on uBlock Origin, leaving over 30 million Chrome users susceptible to intrusive ads News By Kevin Okemwa published 2 days ago Google ramps up its campaign against ad blockers on Chrome. Comments (3) When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google Chrome on PC (Image credit: Future) What you need to know Google is transitioning Chrome's extension support from the Manifest V2 framework to the V3. This means users won't be able to use uBlock Origin to block ads on Google Chrome. However, there's a new iteration of the app — uBlock Origin Lite, which is Manifest V3 compliant but doesn't boast the original version's comprehensive ad-blocking features. Google's campaign against ad blockers across its services just got more aggressive. According to a report by PC World, the company has made some alterations to its extension support on Google Chrome. Google Chrome recently changed its extension support from the Manifest V2 framework to the new Manifest V3 framework. The browser policy changes will impact one of the most popular adblockers (arguably), uBlock Origin. The transition to the Manifest V3 framework means extensions like uBlock Origin can't use remotely hosted code. According to Google, it \"presents security risks by allowing unreviewed code to be executed in extensions.\" The new policy changes will only allow an extension to execute JavaScript as part of its package. Over 30 million Google Chrome users use uBlock Origin, but the tool will be automatically disabled soon via an update. Google will let users enable the feature via the settings for a limited period before it's completely scrapped. From this point, users will be forced to switch to another browser or choose another ad blocker. A new version of uBlock Origin The company has released a new version of the app that’s Manifest V3 compliant — uBlock Origin Lite. It's worth noting that while the new app ships with similar features to the original version, including core ad-blocking features, it doesn't support dynamic filters for blocking scriptlet injection. The Lite version's capabilities are relatively limited due to its compliance with the Manifest V3 framework threshold. According to uBlock Origin's developer Raymond Hill \"I consider uBO Lite to be too different from uBO to be an automatic replacement. You will have to explicitly find a replacement to uBO according to what you expect from a content blocker. uBO Lite may or may not fulfill your expectations.\" Get the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

Right. This said, I see three more ways for free (like gratis) services (at least free for users): 1. Government-funded services. If some online services are deemed to be very important for public wellbeing, the government might decide to pay for a service or to run it themselves. One example is public databases like a list of medication covered by health insurance. 2. Non-profits. They can live off voluntary donations from users, governments, and companies. 3. Hobbyist-supported services. People work pro bono to support a service and some hobbyists even pay for third-party services (like hosting). These are not sharply discerned categories. A service might nominally be run by a non-profit, but the non-profit is staffed by hobbyists and the government might pay for hosting and other costs. Such a service would be a government-funded hobbyist service run by a non-profit. reply NoGravitas 5 hours agorootparentIf you're not trying to be global scale and/or the only site in your market segment, you can go pretty far off of voluntary donations.

Edge is in process of updating their timeline [1]. I think the problem is. What if Chromium won't have code supporting V2 anymore? This means, it is just impossible to run V2 extensions because V2 is not only turned off but completely removed.

Vivaldi already has a built-in adblocker in place, so Vivaldi ad-blocking doesn't depend on V2 being available.

Edit: another thing is if you are happy with adblocking on Safari, you won't notice much difference with uBO lite, since Safari only supports effectively the same API as MV3. uBO has never been available on Safari since Safari 13, because Safari already did the equivalent of MV3 in 2019 with their version 13 release. reply odo1242 16 hours agoparentprevSpecifically: - YouTube ad blocking will not work. At all, most likely. The filter lists/scriptlets would have be updated more often than Google would be willing to process extension updates (because filter lists can no longer be updated separately from the extension) - Some sites will show blank space where ads used to be. - If a website bypasses adblocking, it will take (a week?) longer than it normally does for those updates to propagate, because those updates have to go through Google’s review first. - It’ll be hard to update the extension to tackle more advanced ad blocking technologies, because the blocking engine is hardcoded into the browser in MV3 reply eco 16 hours agoparentprevThere's a FAQ that explains things: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/wiki/Frequently-as... To me, the biggest issue is filter lists can only be updated when the extension updates and Google controls the update cadence.

It affects extensions like uBos most, for sure, and for some of its core features it cannot even be worked around. But it also hurts the \"long tail\" of the extension scene badly. I have dozens of mature, not-really-need-to-frequently-update extensions that require (perhaps trivial) changes to fit Manifest V3. But god knows if the author is still around or bothered to update them. I'm sure some of them are not because I had to download the source code and install them manually. It's basically python 2 to 3 transition but for Chrome WebExt, even if you ignore the new API restriction part. --------------- On a broader note, I'm increasingly frustrated by the constant pressure on users to adapt their habits to software changes. This isn't just about Chrome or browsers in general. Every year, I find myself spending countless hours battling changes in Chrome, Firefox, Office, Windows, MacOS, not to mention various websites, just to restore functionalities or user experiences that were already there but have been altered or removed. This often involves tweaking hidden settings, using command line switches, or relying on third-party or self-made extensions and scripts. And it affects so-called 'power users' the most because they're typically the ones who use the software or service to its fullest. I consider myself someone who is open to change. For example, when they move the search button for the umpteenth time (I'm looking at you, Google Play Store), it's annoying, but I can adapt. However, the removal of a feature is something you can't simply \"adapt\" to. It leads to a tangible loss of productivity, and it's even more frustrating when a feature that was previously available is suddenly gone. reply KerryJones 16 hours agoprevBefore people take this at pure headline value: \"uBlock Origin fans can rest at ease since a new and improved version is already available — uBlock Origin Lite.

    "originBody": "Software 21 Google is a monopoly. The fix isn't obvious 21 A business breakup may be coming – but what comes after may not be better Thomas Claburn Thu 15 Aug 2024 // 11:28 UTC Comment After more than 15 years of insisting that \"competition is only a click away,\" Google's antitrust mantra is no longer keeping the regulators at bay. Back in 2013, Google escaped unscathed from a US Federal Trade Commission probe when the watchdog agency closed its investigation without bringing charges. Its other run-ins with competition cops around the world have been similarly inconsequential. There have been fines, but they've been immaterial. In the past eight months, however, Google has lost two major US competition lawsuits: One brought by Epic Games over Google's grip on the Android ecosystem, the other brought by the Department of Justice over the Big G's market-dominating search advertising business. In the Epic Games case this week, the FTC – emboldened under boss Lina Khan – urged the judge to consider an appropriate remedy and ignore Google's fretting about the potential cost of compliance. And in the DoJ's search advertising case, the focus has also turned to possible remedies, now that Google has been declared an unlawful monopolist. The Chocolate Factory has appealed the Epic verdict and also plans to challenge the DoJ's victory. However, given the EU's preliminary findings in 2023 that Google violated antitrust laws with its advertising practices, and a separate trial this September over Justice Department allegations about Google's ad tech operations, it's looking increasingly unlikely the search giant will survive in its current form or with its current arrangements. Reports suggest American prosecutors working on the search advertising case have been discussing remedies including a corporate breakup, to present at a September 6 hearing. These measures include possibly slicing off Chrome and Android from Google into separate entities; forcing the internet giant to ditch its exclusive deals that make it the default search engine on devices and in browsers; and/or making it share data with rivals. Jason Kint, CEO for trade group Digital Content Next, told The Register that with regard to the DoJ's search advertising case, \"Forced divestiture of Chrome and Android I think are both on the table for sure.\" \"What the judge made clear was that they [Google] have an overwhelming monopoly in search,\" said Kint. \"And they've abused it.\" If the pending separate ad tech trial – which covers the backend auction part of Google's ad business – goes the same way as the search one, Google's DoubleClick business, or a related piece of ad auction infrastructure, could be on the chopping block. One of the central issues in the DoJ's search ads case is the payments Google makes to Apple and Mozilla to be the default search engine in Safari and Firefox. If those go away, there will be blood – not just for Google but also for Apple and Mozilla. Apple would have to find other revenue to replace roughly $20 billion in annual payments from Google. That might encourage the iBiz to compete with Google – by building its own search engine, or acquiring one. Mozilla, already showing interest in the ad business, might be pushed further in that direction – an outcome unlikely to appeal to the anti-commercial portion of its constituency. A fitting though unlikely outcome would be for Google to be forced to turn Chrome and the open source Chromium project over to Mozilla. That would probably involve the creation of an independent non-profit foundation that didn't reduce browser diversity – so Chrome and Firefox could continue to lead independent lives. Microsoft pushing, pushing, pushing Edge in Defender slammed as a 'dark pattern' Microsoft tweaks fine print to warn everyone not to take its AI seriously Apple tries again to make EU DMA officials happy – with new fees UK monopoly police launch full blown probe of Amazon's Anthropic tie-up Chrome could also be operated as a for-profit business, but revenue generation might be an issue – netizens expect browsers to be free, so we'd be back to default search deals and selling information to advertisers. The possibility of forcing the divestiture of Android is also intriguing – but it's unclear how Android development and app distribution would work if starved of Google's monopoly money. It's worth asking whether any of Google's peers – Amazon, Apple, Meta, or Microsoft – could turn Android or Chrome into a business that better served the public. The answer is almost certainly not. After all, each of these giants also faces ongoing antitrust scrutiny. And each of them would probably look for ways to make Chrome or Android more extractive. Side note: There are some within Big Tech that believe Google and others like it can outrun any monetary punishment. Whatever fine may be imposed against them, when it comes time to pay after all the ensuing appeals and challenges are over, the corporation being punished will have grown large enough during that time to comfortably file the original fine under its business expenses. There's a real risk that a poorly targeted remedy would just allow some other data predator to thrive, or would degrade the overall ecosystem – as happened when wolves were removed from Yellowstone. Imagine a Meta operating Google Play, and what the privacy disclosures would look like then. The problem is that software platforms need regulation tuned to their specific abuses. Operating a software (or e-commerce) platform is similar to operating a shopping mall, except that platform landlords can impose arbitrary terms on tenants that would never fly in the physical world. In the tech industry, a platform is simply a vehicle for unfair competition – see the FTC allegations against Amazon. Say someone opens a shop selling maps and it proves popular. As the platform landlord, you may decide you too want to run a map shop. It would be a petty thing to do to a shop owner whose efforts and presence add value to your mall, but there's no law against it. Chrome Web Store warns end is nigh for uBlock Origin JUST FYI And if your tenant's shop is doing better, you can rearrange the mall layout to make that shop harder to find while you move your own shop to the entryway where everyone will see it. Or you may decide to impose some arbitrary contractual rule that gives you an advantage. Perhaps you'll implement private APIs that make your maps function better while not allowing your tenant to use those APIs. Maybe you'll choose to charge a commission that makes it hard for the tenant to be profitable. Such self-preferencing is common on software platforms, when it would cause an outcry or a lawsuit in an actual mall. Forcing Google to divest Chrome or Android may help – but whatever remedy is imposed, it needs to also address self-preferencing, just as Europe's Digital Markets Act has done for designated gatekeepers. Platform owners should be forbidden from favoring their own services and competing unfairly with platform tenants. ® Whitepaper: Top 5 Tips For Navigating Your SASE Journey Share More about Antitrust Google Government More like these × More about Antitrust Google Government Law Software Narrower topics AdBlock Plus Android App Application Delivery Controller App stores Audacity Chrome Chromium Competition and Markets Authority Confluence Cross-border data flow Database Digital Services Act Federal government of the United States FOSDEM FOSS Gemini Google AI Google Cloud Platform Google I/O Google Nest Government of the United Kingdom Grab Graphics Interchange Format G Suite IDE Insider Trading Jenkins Kubernetes Legacy Technology LibreOffice Map Microsoft 365 Microsoft Office Microsoft Teams Mobile Device Management OpenOffice Pixel Privacy Sandbox Privacy Shield Programming Language QR code Retro computing Software bug Software License Tavis Ormandy Text Editor User interface Visual Studio Visual Studio Code WebAssembly Web Browser WordPress Broader topics Alphabet Competition Search Engine Sector More about Share 21 COMMENTS More about Antitrust Google Government More like these × More about Antitrust Google Government Law Software Narrower topics AdBlock Plus Android App Application Delivery Controller App stores Audacity Chrome Chromium Competition and Markets Authority Confluence Cross-border data flow Database Digital Services Act Federal government of the United States FOSDEM FOSS Gemini Google AI Google Cloud Platform Google I/O Google Nest Government of the United Kingdom Grab Graphics Interchange Format G Suite IDE Insider Trading Jenkins Kubernetes Legacy Technology LibreOffice Map Microsoft 365 Microsoft Office Microsoft Teams Mobile Device Management OpenOffice Pixel Privacy Sandbox Privacy Shield Programming Language QR code Retro computing Software bug Software License Tavis Ormandy Text Editor User interface Visual Studio Visual Studio Code WebAssembly Web Browser WordPress Broader topics Alphabet Competition Search Engine Sector TIP US OFF Send us news",

Breakup may be coming; what comes after may not be better (theregister.com)157 points by rntn 6 hours agohidepastfavorite283 comments bearjaws 6 hours agoIf what comes after is not better, then we waited too long to break this monopoly up. We either start ripping this band-aids off or we will just continually have a worse and worse internet. reply Red_Leaves_Flyy 4 hours agoparentThe housing and finance markets seem like a fitting example. Under and over investment respectively fueled bubbles that fed each other until their inevitable pop took the entire economy down and required a decade of artificially suppressed rates backed by trillions in debt setting us for bigger problems when an actual economic crisis occurs (Covid). We’re still weathering this storm of financial mismanagement on a national scale. Narrowing in, housing is now being over invested in fueling a bubble while the communities houses exist in are victims of underinvestment. Zooming back out, whatever pain comes from breaking Google up today will be less than the pain of doing so in a decade. Even more broadly, the pain of breaking up any monopoly (a matter how small) today will be less than when their breakup is as or more pressing than any of the historical antitrust cases. As Senator John Sherman put it, \"If we will not endure a king as a political power we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life.\" Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, ATT/Verizon/Tmobile, and hoards of smaller but similarly situated companies behave as kings shaping markets, acting without accountability or culpability, and shaking down the public at their whims. The gospel of the stock market has paralyzed our legislators from taking action to put these corrupt, wasteful, polluting and abusive businesses in their place or out of operation. reply chipdart 2 hours agorootparent> artificially suppressed rates I don't follow your point. All rates are set arbitrarily according to the monetary policy followed on any specific moment. What leads you to believe that arbitrarily setting a rate one way is natural, but arbitrarily setting it another way is more natural? > Zooming back out, whatever pain comes from breaking Google up today will be less than the pain of doing so in a decade. Will it, though? Think about the problem for a second. Do you think it would be more painful to break up Yahoo now than it would have been a decade ago? What about Intel? What about IBM? I mean,do you think Google of all companies is doing great? reply deepsquirrelnet 5 hours agoparentprevThe bigger problem is that by conglomerating all of these businesses that are operating in different industries, Google has cut out competition from companies that would provide those services. Why does Google search use Google adwords? Is it because adwords has given them the better terms than their competition or because they have no choice by virtue of being the same company? reply IX-103 5 hours agorootparentOr because AdWords was designed and specifically optimized for search and then only later released (in a modified form) as a separate product. reply datadrivenangel 4 hours agorootparentAdWords was primarily built by purchasing the biggest competitor, DoubleClick. Google intentionally built the best ad serving engine, in large part by buying the competition out. reply jasode 4 hours agorootparent>AdWords was primarily built by purchasing the biggest competitor, DoubleClick. Your timeline is not right. Google was created in 1998. DoubleClick was acquired by Google +9 years later in 2008. AdWords was a homegrown Google project starting around 2000. AdWords was an internally built auction-based system selling keywords using some ideas from Goto/Overture. In contrast, Doubleclick was an ad-exchange-network marketplace for publishers and advertisers. This was a different market from AdWords that Google wanted to expand into. Today, yes, both products are more integrated with each other. reply nostrademons 2 hours agorootparentprevAdWords came out in 2000. Google acquired DoubleClick in 2007. AdWords was much better before the DoubleClick acquisition. It turned into crap as DoubleClick management forced the engineering-focused AdWords management out. I don't know if you have any personal experience from that time period, but AdWords was magical for an online business in the mid-00s. You could get conversion rates orders of magnitude higher than display ads like DoubleClick. Whole businesses were built off of providing a solution to a problem that people were searching for. It was also a hell of a lot less intrusive than the banner ads that occupied the web in the late 1990s - AdWords was text only, and worked because you had a need, somebody had a solution, and Google matched them up. You didn't have to see all these products that you didn't need. We're unfortunately going back to the brand advertising days of a corporate monoculture, largely because Google Search (and the web in general) sucks now. reply deepsquirrelnet 4 hours agorootparentprevThey didn’t have to go into new business sectors under the same parent company. They chose to because it allowed them to control multiple sectors without competition. Regardless, there is not competition in their business in areas where there should be according to monopoly rules.

I don't follow your logic, because it does not have any logic. Can you clarify your line of reasoning? I mean, if breaking up a company creates more problems than the ones it solves, what leads you to believe that anticipating the breakup would have any impact whatsoever in the fact that breaking up the company creates more problems than the ones it solves? reply jauntywundrkind 2 hours agorootparentThe main thing I specifically value about Google being whole is that there is a part of the business that is a firehouse of money, and some sizable % of this money is used in a Patronage system, supporting not the arts but open source technology & standards. This world would be much poorer a place without this open source work & protocols. I struggle to think of how else we would have got this, what action we would have taken to keep this outcom, while not \"waiting too long\". reply rch 4 hours agoparentprevBreak them all up simultaneously or find a better approach. My perception is that there are too many politicians trying to pick winners for their own benefit. reply danaris 23 minutes agorootparentThe system is very fundamentally not designed to support such an approach (much as I agree that it would produce a better result). The way to break up companies is to win antitrust lawsuits against them. Except in cases where the companies are actually tied together in some meaningful way (ie, they're not fully separate companies in practice), there's no way to link such suits to each other; each one has to stand or fall on its own merits, and on its own timetable. I think it would be hard to argue that Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc are actually arms of the same company. Thus, each of these Big Tech antitrust suits needs to happen separately, and some of the remedies might end up combining in counterproductive ways, because they are generally not able to consider each other's situations (the remedies have to be based on the facts of the individual case, AIUI). It sucks, but it's the only antitrust system we've got right now. reply Narhem 1 hour agoparentprevYou could say the same thing about every technology company. reply matthewfelgate 6 hours agoparentprevWhat about Microsoft? reply sensanaty 5 hours agorootparentIn these types of discussions, people love bringing out the \"But what about $OTHER_OBVIOUS_MONOPOLY?\". The solution is simple (the word simple here is doing a lot of work, I know); Meta, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple and any other similarly sized behemoth should be nuked, and not just in the tech world. Microsoft should've been properly nuked 30 years ago with the original anti-trust, yet alone now, same goes for the others. reply sunaookami 5 hours agorootparentNot to mention that Microsoft wasn't broken up because Bush intervened: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/sep/07/microsoft... reply tantalor 5 hours agorootparentObviously nothing more than a coincidence, but very interesting this news came out days before 9/11. I wonder if this would have gotten more attention at the time. reply extraduder_ire 2 hours agorootparentprevAmazon is a funny example to imagine being broken up, since they famously try to isolate their business units from each other and keep them self-sustaining income wise. It might kill or dramatically change some business units like twitch, or IMDB though. reply danaris 27 minutes agorootparentThat's the point. They use the money from their cash-cow businesses to artificially prop up their other lines of business, insulating them from having to actually compete on an even footing. That's textbook abuse of monopoly (or market-dominant) position. reply abirch 5 hours agorootparentprevThe funny thing is this is going to be benefit Microsoft significantly. Much of what Google did Chrome, Android, etc. was to prevent Microsoft from destroying it like Netscape, Novell, Lotus, Wordperfect, ... It's probably no coincidence that Google's first external CEO Eric Schmidt was the CEO of Novell. reply jonhohle 5 hours agorootparentBy the time Chrome was released, Google was already a behemoth. I can’t think of another .com that was anywhere near their size. Microsoft was only 2x bigger by market cap. They were hardly a small company that Microsoft could push around and had the advantage of not being dependent on anything MS was doing. reply abirch 5 hours agorootparentGoogle came out with Chrome in 2008. Prior to that they were dependent on the Mozilla Foundation. Microsoft came out with Bing in 2009. Some say that Bing is \"Bing is not google\" Much like Windows NT was rumored to be Novell Terminator. reply cma 5 hours agorootparentprevGoogle toolbar came first. Slipped in a Google search box on everyone's browser in exchange for blocking Google's competitors' popup ads (Google didn't use popup ads). Now Google does invasive popovers within the page, etc., and this time with them in charge of the browser they are ahout to implement a plan to block extension makers from stopping it well. reply card_zero 5 hours agorootparentprevThe eternal struggle to control the levers of enshittification. reply danaris 5 hours agorootparentprevWhat this means is that we also need antitrust action against Microsoft (particularly since the first one was thwarted by the election of a very pro-big-business administration, that stopped the implementation of fairly sweeping remedies). It's not exactly a hot take nowadays that all the Big Tech companies are probably overdue for serious antitrust action. reply monooso 5 hours agorootparentprevI don't have a strong opinion either way, but if that's your argument against breaking up Google, it's a weak one. reply airstrike 5 hours agorootparentprev\"What about Y\" has no bearing on X. Go ahead and spawn that separate thread. reply AnimalMuppet 6 hours agoparentprevIt appears to me that your two paragraphs contradict each other. If we break up Google and what comes afterwards is worse, then break it up or we'll get worse? Is it worse if we do and worse if we don't? Which \"worse\" is worse? Or do I misunderstand your point? The whole point of breaking up monopolies is not moral principle. It's so that things get better for customers. If they don't, then what's the justification for breaking them up? reply brookst 5 hours agorootparentGoing to the dentist hurts more than a cavity.

The second best time is now. reply JKCalhoun 5 hours agorootparentprevBreaking up Google gets worse the longer we wait. reply kmmlng 5 hours agorootparentThat seems to be in support of the parent's point. So breaking up Google would have resulted in worse outcomes for consumers 10 years ago, but it would be even worse today? Then it wouldn't have made sense to break them up 10 years ago and it would make even less sense today. I'm not claiming there aren't any good reasons to break up Google (I don't know), but this line of argumentation doesn't work as far as I can see. reply JKCalhoun 5 hours agorootparentIf your of the opinion that Google should not be broken up at all, ever, then your point is valid. reply chipdart 2 hours agorootparent> If your of the opinion that Google should not be broken up at all, ever, then your point is valid. I don't think it's a good sign that you decided to resort to baseless personal accusations in reaction to a simple request to support your baseless clams. The question is very simple: does it still make sense to break the company today? Not a decade ago, but today. It you believe so, why? reply labcomputer 2 hours agorootparentprevIf you are neutral on whether Google should be broken up, and breaking up the company results in consumer harm, then breaking up the company makes no sense.

This argument is perplexing. Isn't the whole point of this sort of intervention to fix things that are broken so that everyone is better off? You're arguing for major interventions at a time they are arguably not needed at all and would expectedly leave everyone worse, and the only mitigating factor you could come up was that perhaps who knows things might \"eventually get better\".

Browsing search engine results these days reminds me of post apocalyptic movie scenery. reply oneplane 5 hours agorootparentI'm not sure Search is the most important product (for users) at this point. It should be, but Gmail and YouTube come to mind as much more important services for end-users. People haven't really been 'browsing the web' for over a decade now. Search hasn't felt good for years, but Gmail for example has been pretty good for a long time. Say the Search product is split off, it would instantly collapse as without the crutches of the Ad business it has no way to support itself. Maybe if we normalise paying for web products, and have some sort of \"10 searches for free per day\" starting point. That could open the door for a sustainable product that actually does what it needs to do. Perhaps the classic (and not in-line) ad sidebar with clear markings (and different markup) could provide some coverage there as well. But others have tried that (from scratch, with no brand recognition) and haven't really become a household name so far... Google has essentially built a software Ouroboros, and if you try to take any of the critical (the most well-known) parts out, it fails and everyone is left with nothing. reply ekianjo 5 hours agorootparentprevThere are alternatives.

Same goes for Android. reply jonhohle 4 hours agorootparentSo if a business mode is successful, regardless of whether it’s actively thwarted competition or acted anticompetitively, it should be regulated?

Textbook definition: \"A market structure characterized by a single seller, selling a unique product in the market.\" Google Search has competitors and is not even selling its search product. reply InsideOutSanta 5 hours agorootparentIn this context, \"selling\" can't just mean \"exchanging for money\", it has to mean something like \"exchanging for a valuable consideration.\" The valuable consideration that you provide in exchange for using Google is your attention on their ads, and your behavioral and personal data that can be sold. And I would say that Google can fairly be called a unique product in the market. They are the default search engine on almost all browsers and operating systems, their mobile phone operating system owns 70% of the global market share, and most of these devices give Google's search engine preferential treatment, their name is synonymous with searching on the web, their market share is over 90%, they have more data on their users than probably any other company and can provide more personalized search results than anyone else, their web index is clearly more complete than e.g. Bing's (if you do a domain-restricted search, Google often finds twice as many results as Bing). It's true that alternatives to Google exist, but Google's overwhelming market dominance makes it imo difficult to argue that they aren't a monopoly in practice. reply olalonde 5 hours agorootparentThey're dominant but mainly due to the quality/cost of their products, not because competing with them is impossible.

Capitalism may be a problem, but Google's specific technology and size, enabling them to reach people at high-speed, is also a problem. The fact is, capitalism on a small scale (trade with money in local communities) is much less damaging than on a global scale due to the anonymizing effects of scale and the economies of scale being much more efficient at effecting tragedy of the commons.

If Chrome wasn't a viable business without Google's ads subsidizing it, isn't its existence in its current form exactly the kind of anti-competitive outcome we would be better off without? Without Google subsidizing Chrome, a real competitive market for browsers might emerge, with more vendors investing more effort into competing for users, without having to compete against one of the richest companies in the world that sees its browser as a loss-leader for its ad business, has the ability to dump infinite money into its product, and can advertise it on the one website that 90% of people regularly visit? reply sdenton4 5 hours agorootparentI dunno, man - a competitive market for browsers likely involves the browser itself inserting a bunch of ads all over the place.

I don't think this is going to be the case. This seems like an extreme conclusion with virtually no precedent. Since an ad browser is such an important piece of software, I imagine it will receive many donations. The reason Chrome doesn't is because it doesn't need them. I think that will change. Also, I think it's possible you will pay for a browser at some point. Ultimately software costs money to make and we've become desensitized to that because we've exchanged that cost for advertising. But advertising sucks. For example, I pay double for HBO Max just so I don't see ads, and I'm not alone in that. reply shadowgovt 3 hours agorootparentThe precedent is that every browser out there currently has one of: - integration to ad infrastructure - integration to the vendor's other service infrastructure - a cost of more than $0 Given that the market is full of people who will only bear $0, the likely conclusion is that a Chrome separated from the ability to integrate to vendor infrastructure will turn to integrating to someone's ad infrastructure (more poorly and less securely than Chrome currently integrates to Google's infra). reply InsideOutSanta 4 hours agorootparentprev\"I will never pay for a browser\" ...in the current market, which was created by companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google, who subsidized their browsers through other income. reply shadowgovt 3 hours agorootparentIf Google is broken up, Apple will still have Safari and Microsoft will still have Edge.

An easier example would be Microsoft and Office; you could spin off an application like that quite successfully, the same might apply to their ERP. But those examples only stem from the fact that they used to be isolated 'offline' products, and Microsoft is working hard to undo that. Trying to draw parallels between that and Google Workspace, that is a technical nightmare considering the entire distributed nature means that half of workspace can't exist outside of Google. You'd have to copy Google to host it outside of it, and I'm not talking about GCP or Borg or anything like that, it's everything, from the GSLB to Zanzibar, from monorail to the custom hardware everything runs on. Perhaps a double-digit years long refactor could change that, but nobody wants to pay for that. reply jerf 5 hours agorootparentMicrosoft for a good long while made money on two things: Office and Windows. You could break them up into \"Office\", \"Windows\", and any combination of \"everything else\", and for the most part what would happen is that the Office and Windows parts would make more money proportionally, and most if not all of the \"everything else\" would die. Even products that could nominally have survived on their own if they had grown up on their own would die because by the time the corporate culture adapted to the new realities they'd mostly already be dead. Given that monopoly-breakups are supposed to be in the public interest, it is a complicated argument to make in court that the public is advantaged by all those ancillary services getting killed. Now, I'm happy to declare that; I think the \"culture of free\" is corrosive, to probably an even greater degree than most other HN users. I'm outright willing to call it morally corrosive, for both the companies and the consumers. You, dear $READER, may not be inclined to go that far, especially perhaps on the consumer side. I'm just putting down my cards so that you can see that when I point out that in court that's going to be a difficult argument, it's an admission against my interests and biases. Google is similar. They make money on ads and everything else is a distant second. Even search might have trouble standing on its own because it is funded on ad revenue; split them up that way and how is search getting funded? Google Cloud could certainly survive on its own for a time, but if it had to reduce investment it could go into an uncompetitive death spiral of having to match investment resources to profits over the years. Gmail could in principle make radically more money if they charged $5/month or something, but how many customers will do that? And how on Earth would you even break up Android? You can't just hack it out as its own thing; it integrates with a lot of Google things and there's no way they'd all end up in the same entity. I'm willing to just hack them to pieces and let the market figure it out. I think in the long term we'd come out stronger. But I'm arguing here in a relatively friendly forum for that and probably a lot of you still disagree with me. I'd hate to be arguing this in court. reply aembleton 3 hours agorootparent> how is search getting funded? With ads, by making deals with ad brokers. Its just that they will be able to shop around rather than using their own in house one reply labcomputer 2 hours agorootparentSure, but why should we think that those deals will be better than what “Search Google” has with “Ads Google” today? Whatever revenue is attributed to Search today is just the result of internal horse-trading, perhaps augmented with some accountant’s estimation of “fair market value” for ad space in search results. After the breakup anything is fair game. Maybe the ad broker keeps 95% of ad revenue. And, if you believe that Google has been using its monopoly to raise ad prices, why shouldn’t prices fall? reply brookst 5 hours agoparentprevAds and search are the two businesses that most directly collude and which could both survive and thrive independently. If the search business worked with other ad networks to maximize their revenue, while the ad business worked with other search engines, we’d likely see higher quality search results, less confusion about what’s an ad versus a result, and better as rates for buyers. That said I don’t support that remedy at all. Maybe ten or fifteen years ago, but now it’s too late and the market is evolving around Google. IMO a consent decree that they won’t pay anyone for exclusive search placement is sufficient. reply nordsieck 5 hours agorootparent> Ads and search are the two businesses that most directly collude and which could both survive and thrive independently.

Whatever the technical integration between Google search and Google ads, why could it not be done with multiple, competing ad networks? reply bluGill 6 hours agoparentprevIf they break up the ad business it could be helpful. Otherwise search and youtube are like you say synergistic and there is no obvious way to break them up. reply oneplane 5 hours agorootparentKeep in mind that without the Ad business, most of Google's products cannot exist. Search gets paid by Ads, same with YouTube. Most of the free product are just Ad delivery platforms, and they are all pretty much on the verge of losing money as-is. The Ad business itself has margin enough to cover that, and without a set of outlets like those services, it wouldn't be able to exist. Vimeo has tried a different approach, but it's hardly in the same league as YouTube. reply IX-103 5 hours agorootparentYouTube has been profitable in recent years -- thanks to an investment in hardware transcoding reducing costs. So that is potentially separable. One point to mention is that there are two different \"Google Ads\". Search ads are very different from page ads (DoubleClick). You could certainly take away the DoubleClick part, but separating Search Ads from Search is much harder. reply bluGill 3 hours agorootparentprevThe larger point is youTube should sell its own ads. As should search. Double click as an agency that sells ads for other websites shouldn't be allowed to sell to the previous google properties, and vice versa. reply pahkah 5 hours agoparentprevAt the very least, spinning off individual businesses prevents self-preferencing. Google can right now leverage its dominance in one area to increase market share in another. For example, if I load my GMail account in a browser other than Chrome, Google will \"helpfully\" suggest that I change my default browser to the \"recommended\" Chrome. This behavior makes it harder for upstarts to get a foot in the door across a wide range of products — by removing these synergies we reduce the grip Google has across all its lines of business. I suspect the AT&T example may be more similar to the current situation than you're thinking. AT&T wasn't just the network, they also manufactured the phones themselves through subsidiary Western Electric. They leveraged their monopoly in phone service to drive customers toward leasing their phones, similarly (if more aggressively) to how Google drives customers from one product to another. Whether this remedy will be so far-reaching beyond search I don't know, but in the abstract there would be benefits to splitting up the conglomerate. reply criddell 6 hours agoparentprevOne of the potential remedies is to require Google to open source their crawling data.

Even though Android itself is open source, Google Play services really are what allow Google to have so much influence on the Android platform. So what happens to Google Play? Would they be forced to split that off with Android? Would they be forced to continue offering their services for free, but with no strings attached? Would Android have to offer a middleware that lets you choose which services to use a la carte? Would Android device manufacturers have to ship their devices with an open source alternative to Google Play like microG?

Adtech needs to either go back to what it was when Google started out (simple contextual ads, no targeting, no data collection, no flashing or popups or video or or or or...), or just die.[0] The reason these things have all been operated entirely by for-profit entities up to this point is because they're too new for government to have caught up. All the parts of Google that I've named above as needing to be utilities are fundamental, necessary parts of the modern internet, and are basic requirements for the average person to operate in Western society. > How would spinning off an individual business like Chrome, Android, or AdWords reduce their respective dominance? As for this question, Google uses the profit from its dominance in adtech to fund its dominance in other businesses. That's the textbook definition of an abusive monopoly.

Maybe the problem was that Apple has \"that default option for sale.\" reply mjevans 2 hours agorootparentSearch without a setting configured should open the Settings dialog to the page which configures search. On that page should be a list of the current well known / trusted providers (this can be a cached copy for offline config), maybe a refresh button (check for an updated version of that list), and a method of providing an end user installed search option. In short: Empower the End User. reply ApolloFortyNine 5 hours agoprevIt is so easy to switch away from Google I just can't take any break up attempt seriously. ATT WAS phone service in the U.S. 90% of the U.S used ATT when it was broken up, and much of that 90% had no alternative. With Google if another better search engine did appear you could switch in minutes. And if you consider Android a monopoly then you'd have to consider iOS one too, and that's one much more obvious in it's user impact with a 30% cut being taken on the only app store you can install apps from. If you don't like default X being purchased, pass a law. Otherwise we'll just be back here in a few years later if some other company becomes unpopular. reply bradley13 2 hours agoparentEasy to switch away from Google? We're techies, so we don't see a lot of what is going on. Turn off your blockers for ads and trackers. Look at the number of websites that have Google trackers. Look at where the ads come from. That doesn't even count search, and Google search has also become a platform for Google-driven ads. Add in YouTube and other Google properties, and \"monopoly\" is an understatement. A breakup would separate the major services: Google search, YouTube, the ad business (DoubleClick et al), etc.. However, even then, the ad business probably needs to be broken up further. This should all have been done much earlier, at least 5 and maybe even 10 years ago. Now Google is so entrenched that it will be difficult.

Okay ... that is some serious wishcasting. reply kbaker 5 hours agoparentMozilla is a bit of a stretch for sure, but I could see Chromium and maybe Android moved off onto their own independent organizations so they are not beholden to Google/Alphabet's whims.

I'm not sure how that would work, but IMO what reduces the quality of Google products and noticeably makes them worse for consumers is that the products either improve ad dollars or they get cut/receive no funding. reply daft_pink 5 hours agoprevIt’s true. If you look at the history, breaking up companies often results in each division doing well and maybe not an improvement as Youtube/Android/Search/Gmail/Adwords/Chrome all need to earn a profit independently. At a minimum, not having Google paying Firefox/Apple to promote them as the default is a good thing. It’s super annoying that Safari doesn’t allow me to switch to Kagi easily. I understand a reason they do this is to protect users like my father from adware/spyware companies putting in fake search engines, but I’m sure not getting money from Google to force a default has something to do with it as well. reply tantalor 5 hours agoparent> super annoying that Safari doesn’t allow me to switch to Kagi What does Apple not allowing you to set a custom search engine on iOS have to do with Google? reply daft_pink 2 minutes agorootparentGoogle pays Apple $20 billion per year to be the default search engine.

They've made themselves so deeply ingrained and essential to using the internet as loss leaders in some areas that it's impossible to imagine those services standing on their own and still making sense. That's what's responsible for their monopolization, and natural monopolies should be tightly state regulated.

Can you give an example? YouTube is the closest thing I can think of, but it is tightly bound to advertising. Wikipedia, archive.org are two examples of non-Google projects that come to mind when I think of internet \"public-good\".

Done! reply soared 6 hours agoparent2 is not how the US breaks up monopolies reply KMag 4 hours agorootparentRight. Government-mandated access to proprietary data isn't how the US breaks up monopolies, but somewhat along those lines, it might make sense for some government to provide some similar data. This seems much closer to a European style government approach, and I wouldn't expect such a thing in the U.S. The infra for a decent crawl is prohibitive. There's a bit of black magic in crawl scheduling, and a bit in de-duplication, but most of the challenge is in scale. I used to work on Google's indexing system, and sat with the guys who wrote the Percolator system that basically used BigTable triggers to drive indexing and make it less batch-oriented. I know France has made at least a couple of attempts at a government-funded \"Google killer\" search engine. I think it would be a better use of government money to make something like a government-run event-driven first-level indexing system where search engine companies could pay basically cloud computing costs to have their proprietary triggers populate their proprietary databases based on the government-run crawling and first-level analysis. When one page updates, you'd want all of the search engine startups running their triggers on the same copy of the data, rather than having to stream the data out to each of the search engine startups. Basically, you want to take some importance metric, some estimate of the probability some content has changed since the last time you crawled it, combine the product of the two plus some additional constraints (crawl every known page at least some maximum period, don't hit any domain too hard, etc.) as a crawl priority. You then crawl the content, convert HTML, PDF, etc. to some marked-up text format (UTF-8 HTML isn't bad, but I think UTF-8 plain text plus some separate annotations in a binary format would be better). You strip out text that's too small or too close to the background color. You calculate one or more locality-sensitive hash functions over the plain text, cluster similar texts, pick a canonical URL for each cluster. You calculate the directed link graph across clusters. The PageRank patent has expired, so you could calculate PageRank and several other link-graph ranking signals across canonical clusters. You'd presumably compute some uniqueness scores, age scores, etc. for each canonical URL, and then in parallel run each of the search engine startup's analysis over this package of analysis data each time you find a change for a particular canonical URL. You might have some startups providing spam scoring or other analysis and providing that (for fees, of course) to search engine startups, etc. Basically, you want to modularize the indexing and analysis to provide competition and nearly seamless transition between competing providers within your ecosystem. I think that's the way to drive innovation in the search engine startup space and properly leverage economies of scale across search engine startups. reply throwadobe 5 hours agoparentprev#2 will get you laughed out of any room.

It's illegal to try to leverage your monopoly to acquire a monopoly on a different line of business. For example, it was found to be illegal for Microsoft to use the Windows monopoly to try to acquire a monopoly on web browsers. This is kind of going the other way. Google had a monopoly on search (arguably - Bing would like a word). All these other actions are to keep that from being eroded. They didn't do Chrome because they wanted to own the browser market, they did Chrome because they wanted browsers to not be owned by somebody else who could make the default search engine be not-Google.

GoogSearch, well, almost nobody wants to pay for search, so they seek some kind of way to get money, and the start up with the integrated ads, soon to result in what we have now. I used to run various Google Search Appliances, but they bailed out of that market. Peel off GMail? More than zero people want to pay for email, so you might see something like a clunky Fastmail with a free tier and a pay tier. The free tier means ads again and you're evolving to a Yahoo model. Ummm, nobody really wanted that. How about hardware? I dunno, are Pixels a loss leader for Google? I'll bow to someone else's insight on this, and I'm not really hip to the phone scene: are there a lot of \"smartphones, we only make smartphones\" companies? Google Docs and various officeware might stand on its own as a distant second to Microsoft. I know some people pay for that. Google Books, maaaaaaaaaaybe. It might stand on its own but here we just see people having to pay for what was once free. I just don't see anything interesting or stimulating coming out of carving up Google.

That said, this is still good work, especially considering your experience and age (I checked out your 2D physics library on github and I found the trailer on youtube). One suggestion: As someone in the game industry, I personally wouldn't label it an MMO as it doesn't include many of the features, particularly the \"massive\" part of MMO, that is usually associated with that term. The work is already impressive enough, you don't need to give it a label that could open it to criticism. Otherwise, this is solid work. If you're aiming for a career in the game industry eventually, it's a good foundation to build on. reply altanis 6 hours agoparentHey, thanks! You're right, I should've probably labeled it as a multi-player game, not an MMO.

I think thse bugs in this kind of game are especially scary because you lose everything when you die, which makes you a little weary of starting again.

WebSockets suffer from the typical head-of-line blocking issues inherent to TCP, which makes it a suboptimal fit for latency sensitive applications like multiplayer games, where you only care about the most recent state. reply modeless 13 hours agoparentI wouldn't suggest WebTransport unless/until Safari gets support. Instead you can use WebRTC DataChannel today for UDP in all browsers. Also, WebTransport doesn't support direct P2P connections but WebRTC does. I have ported Quake III to use DataChannel and it works great (once all the WebRTC boilerplate is in place). You can test it here: https://thelongestyard.link/ Once you click the multiplayer link you will get a URL with your server name, which others can visit to join your server instantly. reply altanis 2 hours agorootparentWebRTC is complicated; there are many more edge cases compared to websockets. Off the top of my head, I know I'd need to run a TURN server for people behind symmetrical NAT or CGNAT networks, which would be a pain. WebSockets are much more accessible for everyone. In the future I'll investigate UDP protocols, but its likely I'll always use TCP for web games. reply modeless 2 hours agorootparentYes, WebRTC is complicated. But you only need a TURN server for the P2P case. If you are using it in a client-server mode like WebSockets then there is no need for a TURN server, and connection establishment should be significantly simpler. And if you don't need the audio/video stuff then you can ignore that complexity as well. (Although voice chat or even video could be a very cool and differentiating feature for a multiplayer game.) reply tillcarlos 10 hours agorootparentprevMost underrated comment, and what a blast from the past.

Quake III is GPL of course and the code is here: https://github.com/jdarpinian/ioq3 In addition to WebRTC multiplayer and a bunch of random improvements I added web gamepad API support as well as touch controls. Yeah, touch controls, because half of everyone is browsing on their phone and I don't think you can really call it a proper web port if it doesn't work on phones. Touch controls for Quake III were a challenge but I think I have something that's fun to use. I'm interested to hear if it works for people.

I restarted the server for a temporary fix and will fix it sometime today. reply cthalupa 14 hours agoparentprevSomething similar for me as well. Played for about 10 minutes and had it happen a few times - I'd be in a fight or killing some shapes, then it would rocket me across the screen and say someone killed me. The \"kill cam\" would have the person who killed me somewhere quite far a way, and I never saw any bullets coming from that direction. reply david_shi 13 hours agoparentprevSame. I was having a lot of fun playing it otherwise! reply butlike 2 hours agoprevThis is really fun! I like the gameplay loop of grinding the shapes for exp and avoiding the higher-level players. Some things I'd like to see: - Dying and losing exp (and levels) feels overly brutal. Losing ~10 levels a death makes me dejected to re-grind. - The level scaling might be better logarithmic so the initial levels make it super clear as to the benefit the upgrade has. - Up to level 5 there should be a \"noob flag\" where you can't damage or be damaged by other players. This can be toggled off and is only on until the first time you reach level 6. reply altanis 2 hours agoparentHey, thanks for the suggestions! By the way, you can hold K to level up to max, this is temporary though. Levels are determined by halving your XP then finding the correct level, just like Diep.io. I agree with you though; I'll probably make it less harsh. Level scaling is already exponential (its harder to get levels as you progress). I actually really like the noob flag idea; when spectating, a bunch of people were confused on what to do and kept dying to a higher level person. I will definitely add this feature in the following week. reply MrFoof 1 hour agoprevSimple and fun. In my very first game I got to Rank 6 with 24K points. However, there's some cases where the client and server get out of sync (despite only supposed 10-20ms latency) where the server eventually syncs you with some wild rubber banding. I died because during this rubber banding where I was shoved across the map, I likely was picked off by the leader with 118K points. Take care of the latency issues and you have the core of something. Something similar-but-different is \"Realm of the Mad God\" which originally was a Ludum Dare entry using the Oryx spritesheet. So add in some interesting NPCs, and deal with the latency issues and you have the core of something that actually is monetizable. reply altanis 1 hour agoparentYeah that \"desync\" is because the server mspt (shown next to your latency) was likely very high. It's because of a memory leak, I'll investigate when I get a chance. I'll look into that game, I've never heard of it. Not sure how I'd incorporate NPCs in a fast paced game like this, if you have any ideas let me know! reply tiborsaas 7 hours agoprevIt's unplayable at the moment.

    "originLink": "https://jonathanolson.net/exact-polygonal-filtering",
    "originBody": "Efficient and accurate filtering of polygonal shapes can be achieved with closed-form solutions based on Green's theorem with piecewise-polynomial filters (e.g. box/bilinear/bicubic). Canvas SVG Box Filter Bilinear Filter Instead of relying on pixel-approximations or super-sampling to achieve filtering effects, it is possible to directly compute the exact filtered coverage, by: Breaking the polygon up into smaller (usually-pixel-sized) clipped polygons Evaluating the filter integral directly for each clipped polygon Furthermore, this can be done on the GPU, and is demonstrated in WebGPU in this article (if it is enabled). Introduction Rasterization is the process of converting vector graphics into pixel data. When rendering a polygon, the rasterizer needs to determine how much the polygon covers each pixel, so that it can determine the polygon's contribution to the pixel. A fast approach, given many polygons, is to see how much of each polygon is contained within the box of each pixel. However, when polygons overlap, this approach can lead to over-coverage, and can result in incorrect blending known as conflation artifacts. To avoid this, it is ideal to compute exact (non-overlapping) coverage, but it can also be approximated by super-sampling. Filtering is a key component of anti-aliasing, which is used to reduce the visual artifacts that occur when rendering high-frequency content at a lower resolution. Browsers' built-in anti-aliasing for SVG and Canvas shapes, particularly when animated, usually does not include a significant amount of filtering. When displaying certain shapes, this results in aliasing artifacts that can be distracting or even misleading. Filters While a pixel is not a little square, a simple way to get a coverage value is to use the area of the polygon that covers the pixel. This is equivalent to applying a box filter to the polygon, which is the simplest form of filtering. Box filter While the box filter results in a sharp result, it can result in spatial aliasing artifacts. These can be reduced by using other filters. Instead of taking the area of the polygon that covers a square around the center of the pixel, others will evaluate a different weighted function over the polygon. The bilinear and Mitchell-Netravali (bicubic) filters are two common filters that are used in practice, and both are piecewise-polynomial filters. Bilinear filter Mitchell-Netravali (bicubic) filter These piecewise-polynomial filters are equivalent to taking the integral of the piecewise-polynomial function within the polygon, where the filter function is centered at where a sample is being taken. The box filter is equivalent to taking the integral of an indicator function that is 1 within the square, and 0 outside. In particular, each of the above filters has one or more clipped areas of the polygon that will Green's Theorem and Polygons We will dive into the math behind how we can evaluate the integral of a filter over a polygon using Green's Theorem. For more related results, see Alpenglow's integrals for anti-aliasing. Overall: To evaluate an integral (i.e. a filter) over a shape, we can instead evaluate an integral over the boundary. For polygons, this means we can evaluate an expression for each edge (given 𝑥 0 , 𝑦 0 , 𝑥 1 , and 𝑦 1 ), and sum those up. If the integrand is a polynomial, we get a closed-form solution that can be evaluated directly. Using Green's Theorem, we can convert a double integral over a region into a line integral over the (closed, oriented counter-clockwise) boundary of the region: ∮ 𝑃 ( 𝐿 𝑑 𝑥 𝑑 𝑡 + 𝑀 𝑑 𝑦 𝑑 𝑡 ) 𝑑 𝑡 = ∬ 𝑃 ( 𝜕 𝑀 𝜕 𝑥 − 𝜕 𝐿 𝜕 𝑦 ) 𝑑 𝑥 𝑑 𝑦 for curves parameterized on 𝑡 . For polygons, this means that if we can evaluate a line integral over each line segment (between ( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ) and ( 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 , 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 ) , finishing with ( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ) to ( 𝑥 0 , 𝑦 0 ) ), we can sum up each edge's contribution to evaluate the double integral for the region inside the polygon. Each line segment is parameterized curve: 𝑥 = 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) = ( 1 − 𝑡 ) 𝑥 𝑖 + ( 𝑡 ) 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 = 𝑥 𝑖 + 𝑡 ( 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 − 𝑥 𝑖 ) 𝑦 = 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) = ( 1 − 𝑡 ) 𝑦 𝑖 + ( 𝑡 ) 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 = 𝑦 𝑖 + 𝑡 ( 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) for 0 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 1 , with the derivatives: 𝑑 𝑥 𝑑 𝑡 = 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 − 𝑥 𝑖 𝑑 𝑦 𝑑 𝑡 = 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 − 𝑦 𝑖 Note: If we reverse an edge (swap its endpoints), it will swap the sign of the contribution to the integral (a polygon can make a degenerate turn and double-back precisely, with no contribution to area). Thus for terms, swapping 𝑖 and 𝑖 + 1 will swap the sign of the contribution. This means that polygons with holes can be evaluated by visiting the holes with the opposite orientation (clockwise). This is evaluated on closed polygons, so any terms that only depend on one endpoint will cancel out (e.g. 𝑥 𝑖 2 𝑦 𝑖 and − 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 2 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 will have their contributions cancel out, since both of those will be evaluated for every point in the polygon). It is useful to adjust the coefficients to these terms, since they can allow us to factor the expressions into simpler forms (e.g. the Shoelace formula below). We can pick 𝐿 and 𝑀 below: 𝐿 = ( 𝑛 − 1 ) ∫ 𝑓 𝑑 𝑦 𝑀 = ( 𝑛 ) ∫ 𝑓 𝑑 𝑥 so that ∬ 𝑃 ( 𝜕 𝑀 𝜕 𝑥 − 𝜕 𝐿 𝜕 𝑦 ) 𝑑 𝑥 𝑑 𝑦 = ∬ 𝑃 ( ( 𝑛 ) 𝑓 − ( 𝑛 − 1 ) 𝑓 ) 𝑑 𝑥 𝑑 𝑦 = ∬ 𝑃 𝑓 𝑑 𝑥 𝑑 𝑦 for any antiderivatives and real 𝑛 , since the double integral will then be integrating our function 𝑓 . It turns out, evaluating Green's Theorem over line segments for polynomial terms for any linear blend (any 𝑛 ) of 𝐿 and 𝑀 will differ only in the \"canceled out\" terms, so each edge's contribution will be the same. Integrating Polynomials over Polygons If we zero out all of the canceled terms, it turns out that we can evaluate the integral of any polynomial term 𝑥 𝑚 𝑦 𝑛 over a polygon 𝑃 by summing up the contributions of each edge: (1) ∬ 𝑃 𝑥 𝑚 𝑦 𝑛 𝑑 𝑥 𝑑 𝑦 = 𝑚 ! 𝑛 ! ( 𝑚 + 𝑛 + 2 ) ! ∑ 𝑖 [ ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 − 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 𝑦 𝑖 ) ∑ 𝑝 = 0 𝑚 ∑ 𝑞 = 0 𝑛 ( 𝑝 + 𝑞 𝑞 ) ( 𝑚 + 𝑛 − 𝑝 − 𝑞 𝑛 − 𝑞 ) 𝑥 𝑖 𝑚 − 𝑝 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 𝑝 𝑦 𝑖 𝑛 − 𝑞 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 𝑞 ] This was first discovered by Soerjadi in 1968. The contributions of each term can be summed up individually to integrate arbitrary polynomials. e.g. for 𝑥 4 𝑦 2 in matrix form:∬ 𝑃 𝑥 4 𝑦 2 𝑑 𝑥 𝑑 𝑦 = 1 840 ∑ 𝑖 ( ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 − 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 𝑦 𝑖 ) [ 𝑥 𝑖 4 𝑥 𝑖 3 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 𝑥 𝑖 2 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 2 𝑥 𝑖 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 3 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 4 ] [ 15 5 1 10 8 3 6 9 6 3 8 10 1 5 15 ] [ 𝑦 𝑖 2 𝑦 𝑖 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 2 ] ) Any polynomial-based (windowed or not) filter can be evaluated over a polygon with this approach. It may be feasible to approximate Gaussian/Sinc filters with polynomials, or find iterative approaches to converge to the integral. Integrals for Filters Box Filter (Area) As seen above, the box filter is equivalent to a step function that is 1 within the box and 0 outside. When a polygon has been clipped, this is equivalent to evaluating the integral of 1 inside the polygon (i.e. computing its area). For 𝑥 0 𝑦 0 = 1 , with adding some canceling terms to better factor, we will obtain the Shoelace formula for finding the area of a polygon: 𝑎 𝑟 𝑒 𝑎 𝑃 = ∬ 𝑃 1 𝑑 𝑥 𝑑 𝑦 = 1 2 ∑ 𝑖 ( 𝑥 𝑖 + 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 ) ( 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) This formula will be evaluated (with the appropriate order and orientation) for every edge ( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 , 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 ) along a polygon. The sum will be the area of the polygon. Bilinear Filter The bilinear filter is equivalent to integrating the tent function over the polygon. As seen above, this is broken into 4 quadrants, each of which is a polynomial function. Without loss of generality, we can focus on computing the integral solely in the 0 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 1 , 0 ≤ 𝑦 ≤ 1 quadrant. The integrand is thus: ( 1 − 𝑥 ) ( 1 − 𝑦 ) = 𝑥 𝑦 − 𝑥 − 𝑦 + 1 This is a weighted sum of the terms 𝑥 1 𝑦 1 , 𝑥 1 𝑦 0 , 𝑥 0 𝑦 1 , and 𝑥 0 𝑦 0 . We can sum up the weighted contribution of the corresponding terms from , resulting in the following evaluated line integral: 1 24 ∑ 𝑖 ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 − 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 𝑦 𝑖 ) ( 12 − 4 ( 𝑥 𝑖 + 𝑦 𝑖 + 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 + 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 ) + 2 ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑦 𝑖 + 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 ) + 𝑥 𝑖 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 + 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 𝑦 𝑖 ) This formula will be evaluated (with the appropriate order and orientation) for every edge ( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑖 + 1 , 𝑦 𝑖 + 1 ) along a polygon (clipped to the unit square). The sum will be the integral of this quadrant of bilinear filter over the polygon (with the filter centered at the origin). Coordinate transformations can be used to evaluate the other quadrants (applying the absolute value to inputs). Note that the polygon needs to be clipped so that it is fully contained within the unit square. Mitchell-Netravali Filter The Mitchell-Netravali filter family, commonly referred to as \"bicubic\", is a piecewise-polynomial filter that that has a larger support, and includes negative lobes to reduce artifacts. It has 16 different polynomial pieces, which will require the integral evaluation of 3 different pieces. We choose to use the \"Mitchell-Netravali\" filter (specifically with constants 𝐵 = 1 / 3 and 𝐶 = 1 / 3 ). It is separable and symmetric, so the integral is equal to 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑓 ( 𝑦 ) , combining 1-dimensional kernels. The two polynomial chunks we get (assuming a 𝑡 > 0 ) are: 𝑓 0 ( 𝑡 ) = 1 6 ( 7 𝑦 3 − 12 𝑡 2 + 16 3 ) for 0 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 1 , and: 𝑓 1 ( 𝑡 ) = 1 6 ( − 7 3 𝑦 3 + 12 𝑡 2 − 20 𝑡 + 32 3 ) for 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 2 . Taking into account symmetry, this gives us three different polynomial chunks we will need to evaluate: 𝑓 0 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑓 0 ( 𝑦 ) 𝑓 0 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑓 1 ( 𝑦 ) 𝑓 1 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑓 1 ( 𝑦 ) Since the others can be obtained by reversing signs and/or reflection with swapping x/y input. All three of these can be evaluated using the formula , since they are simply polynomials in 𝑥 and 𝑦 . Notably: 𝑓 0 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑓 0 ( 𝑦 ) = [ 1 𝑥 𝑥 2 𝑥 3 ] [ 64 81 0 − 16 9 28 27 0 0 0 0 − 16 9 0 4 − 7 3 28 27 0 − 7 3 49 36 ] [ 1 𝑦 𝑦 2 𝑦 3 ]𝑓 0 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑓 1 ( 𝑦 ) = [ 1 𝑥 𝑥 2 𝑥 3 ] [ 128 81 − 80 27 16 9 − 28 81 0 0 0 0 − 32 9 20 3 − 4 7 9 56 27 − 35 9 7 3 − 49 108 ] [ 1 𝑦 𝑦 2 𝑦 3 ]𝑓 1 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑓 1 ( 𝑦 ) = [ 1 𝑥 𝑥 2 𝑥 3 ] [ 256 81 − 160 27 32 9 − 56 81 − 160 27 100 9 − 20 3 35 27 32 9 − 20 3 4 − 7 9 − 56 81 35 27 − 7 9 49 324 ] [ 1 𝑦 𝑦 2 𝑦 3 ] Long story short, evaluating for these, we get some reasonably long expressions that can be evaluated directly. For example: 𝑓 0 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑓 0 ( 𝑦 ) results in: 1/51840 ( 𝑥 0 - 𝑥 1 ) (3 𝑦 0 4 (896 + 735 𝑥 0 3 + 45 𝑥 0 2 (-32 + 7 𝑥 1 ) + 15 𝑥 0 𝑥 1 (-32 + 7 𝑥 1 ) + 3 𝑥 1 2 (-32 + 7 𝑥 1 )) + 128 (160 + 3 𝑥 0 2 (-20 + 7 𝑥 0 ) + 6 𝑥 0 (-20 + 7 𝑥 0 ) 𝑥 1 + 9 (-20 + 7 𝑥 0 ) 𝑥 1 2 + 84 𝑥 1 3 ) 𝑦 1 - 96 (80 + 3 (-4 + 𝑥 0 ) 𝑥 0 2 + 12 (-4 + 𝑥 0 ) 𝑥 0 𝑥 1 + 30 (-4 + 𝑥 0 ) 𝑥 1 2 + 60 𝑥 1 3 ) 𝑦 1 3 + 3 (896 + 3 𝑥 0 2 (-32 + 7 𝑥 0 ) + 15 𝑥 0 (-32 + 7 𝑥 0 ) 𝑥 1 + 45 (-32 + 7 𝑥 0 ) 𝑥 1 2 + 735 𝑥 1 3 ) 𝑦 1 4 + 6 𝑦 0 2 𝑦 1 (-16 (80 + 30 𝑥 0 3 + 36 𝑥 0 2 (-2 + 𝑥 1 ) + 12 (-3 + 𝑥 1 ) 𝑥 1 2 + 9 𝑥 0 𝑥 1 (-8 + 3 𝑥 1 )) + (448 + 3 (35 𝑥 0 3 + 9 𝑥 0 𝑥 1 (-16 + 7 𝑥 1 ) + 𝑥 1 2 (-96 + 35 𝑥 1 ) + 𝑥 0 2 (-96 + 63 𝑥 1 ))) 𝑦 1 ) + 4 𝑦 0 (32 (160 + 84 𝑥 0 3 + 9 𝑥 0 2 (-20 + 7 𝑥 1 ) + 6 𝑥 0 𝑥 1 (-20 + 7 𝑥 1 ) + 3 𝑥 1 2 (-20 + 7 𝑥 1 )) - 24 (80 + 12 (-3 + 𝑥 0 ) 𝑥 0 2 + 9 𝑥 0 (-8 + 3 𝑥 0 ) 𝑥 1 + 36 (-2 + 𝑥 0 ) 𝑥 1 2 + 30 𝑥 1 3 ) 𝑦 1 2 + 3 (224 + 21 𝑥 0 3 + 15 𝑥 1 2 (-16 + 7 𝑥 1 ) + 9 𝑥 0 2 (-8 + 7 𝑥 1 ) + 3 𝑥 0 𝑥 1 (-64 + 35 𝑥 1 )) 𝑦 1 3 ) + 12 𝑦 0 3 (32 (-20 + 7 𝑦 1 ) + 3 (5 𝑥 0 3 (-32 + 7 𝑦 1 ) + 𝑥 1 2 (32 - 8 𝑥 1 - 24 𝑦 1 + 7 𝑥 1 𝑦 1 ) + 5 𝑥 0 2 (64 - 16 𝑥 1 - 16 𝑦 1 + 7 𝑥 1 𝑦 1 ) + 𝑥 0 𝑥 1 (128 - 32 𝑥 1 - 64 𝑦 1 + 21 𝑥 1 𝑦 1 )))) Common terms can be factored out, speeding this up somewhat, but it is still less efficient than the bilinear case. Blurring While the typical filter size is small (and may slightly blur the edges of a polygon), it is possible to dramatically expand the size of the filter (computed for each pixel) to intentionally blur the polygon. Generally when this is done, each of the clipped piecewise-polynomial sections will NOT overlap with those of other pixels, so it takes a bit more computation and clipping to evaluate the integral. Blur Radius Box Bilinear Note that large blur radii are not too much more expensive than small ones, it depends on the geometry of the scene. Each pixel will need to have access to the geometry and shading within its support region. The demo above is slowed down by the GC-hungry CPU procedure that computes occlusion. Implementation Alpenglow has both a CPU and WebGPU implementation of this filtering during rasterization. Both approaches will typically hierarchically clip the polygon into smaller pieces (on the GPU, using the edge-clipped form noted in Alpenglow documentation). On the GPU, this has been done so far by clipping things into approximately 256x256 tiles, and then further into approximately 16x16 sub-tiles, at which the final clipping can be done during the rasterization. There are multiple approaches (using WebGPU compute shaders) to doing this efficiently, it is something I'm working on! The clipped regions need to be expanded by the radius of the filter's support. For example, the bilinear filter will need to be expanded by 1 pixel in each direction, and the bicubic filter will need to be expanded by 2 pixels (from the pixel centers). It turns out that for normal filter sizes, the clipped regions for different pixels will overlap (e.g. for bilinear, pixel 0,0 and 1,1, one of the quadrants will be shared). Thus on the GPU, a workgroup can compute a 16x16 grid of clipped polygons, evaluate all of the 4 potential integrals, and for speed can evaluate the color of that region. Then those integrals can be used to blend the results into a 15x15 section of pixels. This method is the most effective when the occlusion problem has already been solved (e.g. with a computation-area geometry approach like Alpenglow). With that type of approach, the clipped regions will not overlap, and the integrals can be evaluated directly.",

It's clear that GPU compute is the future of 2D rendering, and we need to explore a bunch of different approaches to find the best one. I especially appreciate the focus on rendering quality; the author is absolutely correct that the current state of Vello has conflation artifacts and does not do antialiasing in the correct (linear) colorspace. We do have a plan for conflation free compositing[1] which should closely approximate the quality of the samples here. That in turn depends on sparse strips[2], though a degraded performance experiment could be done to validate the quality outcomes. Sparse strips in turn depend on high performance segmented sort[3]. The analytic approach to path overlaps is intriguing, but I think it will be very challenging to implement efficiently on GPU. I'm looking forward to seeing what results.

There are good reasons why GPUs rely on variations of multisampling. Even CPU-based 3D render engines use similar methods rather than analytic filters, as far as I know. A more interesting approach to antialiasing, in my opinion, is the use of neural nets to generate aesthetically pleasing outputs from limited sample data, as seen for example in NVidia's DLAA [0]. These methods go beyond trying to optimize over-simplistic signal processing reconstruction metrics.

Integrating the phong-exponent light reflections is a little bit insane though (and btw I’ve seen Arvo’s code for it.) The problem you run into with non-constant polygon colors is that you’d have to integrate the product of two different functions here - the polygon color and the filter function. For anything real-world, this is almost certainly going to result in an expression that is not analytically integrable. reply pixelpoet 39 minutes agorootparentYup, I've tried many years ago to follow this work (special cases for even and odd exponents!), with a mix of analytic and numerical integration. IMO linear/tent filter is sufficient. Also more recently there's the Linearly Transformed Cosine stuff, which is most of what people usually want in realtime graphics. Ideally you also want motion blur and probably some other effects, so IMO it just makes sense to use a 2D BVH and high efficiency Monte Carlo importance sampling methods. reply rsp1984 11 hours agoprev> This is equivalent to applying a box filter to the polygon, which is the simplest form of filtering. Am I the only one who has trouble understanding what is meant by this? What is the exact operation that's referred to here? I know box filters in the context of 2D image filtering and they're straightforward but the concept of applying them to shapes just doesn't make any sense to me. Can someone clarify? reply dahart 4 hours agoparentThere’s a picture of the exact operation in the article. Under “Filters”, the first row of 3 pictures has the caption “Box Filter”. The one on the right (with internal caption “Contribution (product of both)”) demonstrates the analytic box filter. The analytic box filter is computed by taking the intersection of the pixel boundary with all visible polygons that touch the pixel, and then summing the resulting colors weighted by their area. Note the polygon fragments also have to be non-overlapping, so if there are overlapping polygons, the hidden parts need to be first trimmed away using boolean clipping operations. This can all be fairly expensive to compute, depending on how many overlapping polygons touch the pixel. reply rsp1984 3 hours agorootparentOK, so reading a bit further this boils down to clipping the polygon to the pixel and then using the shoelace formula for finding the area? Why call it \"box filter\" then? reply dahart 3 hours agorootparentIt’s very useful to point out that it’s a Box Filter because the article moves on to using other filters, and larger clipping regions than a single pixel. This is framing the operation in known signal processing terminology, because that’s what you need to do in order to fully understand very high quality rendering. Dig a little further into the “bilinear filter” and “bicubic filter” that follow the box filter discussion. They are more interesting than the box filter because the contribution of a clipped polygon is not constant across the polygon fragment, unlike the box filter which is constant across each fragment. Integrating non-constant contribution is where Green’s Theorem comes in. It’s also conceptually useful to understand the equivalence between box filtering with analytic computation and box filtering with multi-sample point sampling. It is the same mathematical convolution in both cases, but it expressed very very differently depending on how you sample & integrate. reply mananaysiempre 9 hours agoparentprevThe operation (filtering an ideal, mathematically perfect image) can be described in two equivalent ways: - You take a square a single pixel spacing wide by its center and attach it to a sampling point (“center of a pixel”). The value of that pixel is then your mathematically perfect image (of a polygon) integrated over that square (and normalized). This is perhaps the more intuitive definition. - You take a box kernel (the indicator function of that square, centered, normalized), take the convolution[1] of it with the original perfect image, then sample the result at the final points (“pixel centers”). This is the standard definition, which yields exactly the same result as long as your kernel is symmetric (which the box kernel is). The connection with the pixel-image filtering case is that you take the perfect image to be composed of delta functions at the original pixel centers and multiplied by the original pixel values. That is, in the first definition above, “integrate” means to sum the original pixel values multiplied by the filter’s value at the original pixel centers (for a box filter, zero if outside the box—i.e. throw away the addend—and a normalization constant if inside it). Alternatively, in the second definition above, “take the convolution” means to attach a copy of the filter (still sized according to the new pixel spacing) multiplied by the original pixel value to the original pixel center and sum up any overlaps. Try proving both of these give the answer you’re already accustomed to. This is the most honest signal-processing answer, and it might be a bit challenging to work through but my hope is that it’ll be ultimately doable. I’m sure there’ll be neighboring answers in more elementary terms, but this is ultimately a (two-dimensional) signal processing task and there’s value in knowing exactly what those signal processing people are talking about. [1] (f∗g)(x) = (g∗f)(x) = ∫f(y)g(x-y)dy is the definition you’re most likely to encounter. Equivalently, (f∗g)(x) is f(y)g(z) integrated over the line (plane, etc.) x=y+z, which sounds a bit more vague but exposes the underlying symmetry more directly. Convolving an image with a box filter gives you, at each point, the average of the original over the box centered around that point. reply muyyatin2 11 hours agoparentprevIt is more similar to the convolution of the shape with the filter (you can take the product of the filter, at various offsets, with the polygon) Essentially if you have a polygon function p(x,y) => { 1 if inside the polygon, otherwise 0 }, and a filter function f(x,y) centered at the origin, then you can evaluate the filter at any point x_0,y_0 with the double-integral / total sum of f(x-x_0,y-y_0)*p(x,y). reply blauditore 10 hours agorootparentThis kind of makes sense from a mathematical point of view, but how would this look implementation-wise, in a scenario where you need to render a polygon scene? The article states that box filters are \"the simplest form of filtering\", but it sounds quite non-trivial for that use case. reply Sharlin 10 hours agoparentprevIt literally means that you take a box-shaped piece of the polygon, ie. the intersection of the polygon and a box (a square, in this case the size of one pixel). And do this for each pixel as they’re processed by the rasterizer. If you think of a polygon as a function from R^2 to {0, 1}, where every point inside the polygon maps to 1, then it’s just a signal that you can apply filters to. reply blauditore 10 hours agorootparentBut as I understand it, the article is about rasterization, so if we filter after rasterization, the sampling has already happened, no? In other words: Isn't this about using the intersection of polygon x square instead of single sample per pixel rasterization? reply dahart 4 hours agorootparentThis is about taking an analytic sample of the scene with an expression that includes and accounts for the choice of filter, instead of integrating some number of point samples of the scene within a pixel. In this case, the filtering and the sampling of the scene are both wrapped into the operation of intersection of the square with polygons. The filtering and the sampling are happening during rasterization, not before or after. Keep in mind a pixel is an image sample, which is different from taking one or many point-samples of the scene in order to compute the pixel color. reply Sharlin 5 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is determining the coverage, the contribution of the polygon to a pixel's final color, weighted by a filter. This is relevant at polygon edges, where a pixel straddles one or more edges, and some sort of anti-aliasing is required to prevent jaggies[1] and similar aliasing artifacts, such as moiré, which would result from naive discretization (where each pixel is either 100% or 0% covered by a polygon, typically based on whether the polygon covers the pixel center). [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaggies reply yorwba 10 hours agorootparentprevIt is applying the filter before rasterization, and then taking a single sample of the filtered signal per pixel. reply mfabbri77 11 hours agoprevI am quite convinced that if the goal is the best possible output quality, then the best approach is to analytically compute the non-overlapping areas of each polygon within each pixel. Resolving all contributions (areas) together in the same single pass for each pixel. reply dahart 4 hours agoparentWhy are you convinced of this, and can I help unconvince you? ;) What you describe is what’s called “Box Filtering” in the article. Box filtering is well studied, and it is known to not be the best possible output quality. The reason this is not the best approach is because a pixel is not a little square, a pixel is a sample of a signal, and it has to be approached with signal processing and human perception in mind. (See the famous paper linked in the article: A Pixel is Not a Little Square, A Pixel is Not a Little Square, A Pixel is Not a Little Square http://alvyray.com/Memos/CG/Microsoft/6_pixel.pdf) It can be surprising at first, but when you analytically compute the area of non-overlapping parts of a pixel (i.e., use Box Filtering) you can introduce high frequencies that cause visible aliasing artifacts that will never go away. This is also true if you are using sub-sampling of a pixel, taking point samples and averaging them, no matter how many samples you take. You can see the aliasing I’m talking about in the example at the top of the article, the 3rd one is the Box Filter - equivalent to computing the area of the polygons within each pixel. Look closely near the center of the circle where all the lines converge, and you can see little artifacts above and below, and to the left and right of the center, artifacts that are not there in the “Bilinear Filter” example on the right. reply raphlinus 2 hours agorootparentI think the story is a lot more complicated. Talking about \"the best possible output quality\" is a big claim, and I have no reason to believe it can be achieved by mathematically simple techniques (ie linear convolution with a kernel). Quality is ultimately a function of human perception, which is complex and poorly understood, and optimizing for that is similarly not going to be easy. The Mitchell-Netravali paper[1] correctly describes sampling as a tradeoff space. If you optimize for frequency response (brick wall rejection of aliasing) the impulse response is sinc and you get a lot of ringing. If you optimize for total rejection of aliasing while maintaining positive support, you get something that looks like a Gaussian impulse response, which is very smooth but blurry. And if you optimize for small spatial support and lack of ringing, you get a box filter, which lets some aliasing through. Which is best, I think, depends on what you're filtering. For natural scenes, you can make an argument that the oblique projection approach of Rocha et al[2] is the optimal point in the tradeoff space. I tried it on text, though, and there were noticeable ringing artifacts; box filtering is definitely better quality to my eyes. I like to think about antialiasing specific test images. The Siemens star is very sensitive in showing aliasing, but it also makes sense to look at a half-plane and a thin line, as they're more accurate models of real 2D scenes that people care about. It's hard to imagine doing better than a box filter for a half-plane; either you get ringing (which has the additional negative impact of clipping when the half-planes are at the gamut boundary of the display; not something you have to worry about with natural images) or blurriness. In particular, a tent filter is going to be softer but your eye won't pick up the reduction in aliasing, though it is certainly present in the frequency domain. A thin line is a different story. With a box filter, you get basically a non antialiased line of single pixel thickness, just less alpha, and it's clearly possible to do better; a tent filter is going to look better. But a thin line is just a linear combination of two half-planes. So if you accept that a box filter is better visual quality than a tent filter for a half-plane, and the other way around for a thin line, then the conclusion is that linear filtering is not the correct path to truly highest quality. With the exception of thin lines, for most 2D scenes a box filter with antialiasing done in the correct color space is very close to the best quality - maybe the midwit meme applies, and it does make sense to model a pixel as a little square in that case. But I am interested in the question of how to truly achieve the best quality, and I don't think we really know the answer yet. [1] https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~fussell/courses/cs384g-fall2013/l... [2] https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~eslgastal/SBS3/Rocha_Oliveira_Gast... reply mfabbri77 1 hour agorootparentIn my opinion, if you break down all the polygons in your scene into non-overlapping polygons, then clip them into pixels, calculate the color of each piece of polygon (applying all paints, blend modes, etc) and sum it up, ...in the end that's the best visual quality you can get. And that's the idea i'm working on, but it involves the decomposition/clip step on the CPU, while sum of paint/blend is done by the GPU. reply dahart 55 minutes agorootparentThat isn’t true. Again, please look more closely at the first example in the article, and take the time to understand it. It demonstrates there’s a better method than what you’re suggesting, proving that clipping to pixels and summing the area is not the best visual quality you can get. reply mfabbri77 27 minutes agorootparentAs pointed out by Raphlinus, the moire pattern in the Siemens star isn't such a significant quality indicator for the type of content usually encountered in 2D vector graphics. With the analytical coverage calculation you can have perfect font/text rendering, perfect thin lines/shapes and, by solving all the areas at once, no conflating artifacts. reply dahart 19 minutes agorootparentRaph made an argument that Box is good enough for lots of things, which is subjective and depends entirely on what things you’re doing, and how much you actually care about quality. You are claiming it’s the best possible. Box filter is simply not the best possible, and this fact is well understood and documented. You can relax your claim to say it’s good enough for what you need, and I won’t disagree with you anymore. Personally, I’m sensitive to visible pixelation, and the Box Filter will always result in some visible pixelation with all 2D vector graphics, so if you really care about high quality rendering, I’m very skeptical that you really want Box filtering as the ideal target. Box filter is a compromise, it’s easier & faster to compute. But it’s not the highest quality. It would be good to understand why that’s the case. * Edit to further clarify and respond to this: > With the analytical coverage calculation you can have perfect font/text rendering, perfect thin lines/shapes and, by solving all the areas at once, no conflating artifacts. You cannot get perfect font or text rendering with a Box filter, and you will get some conflating artifacts. They might be very slight, and not bothersome to most people, but they do exist with a Box filter, always. This is a mathematical property of Box filtering, not a subjective claim. reply dahart 1 hour agorootparentprevOh I agree with all of that. And nice to see you on HN Raph - was nice to meet you at HPG the other day. It’s subjective, so box filter being ‘close’ is a somewhat accurate statement. I’m coming from the film world, and so I have a pretty hard time agreeing that it’s “very” close. Box filter breaks often and easily, especially under animation, but it’s certainly better than nearest neighbor sampling, if that’s our baseline. Box filter is pretty bad for nearly any scenario where there are frequencies higher than the pixel spacing, which includes textures, patterns, thin lines, and all kinds of things, and the real world is full of these box-filter-confounding features. One interesting question to ask is whether you the viewer can reliably identify the size of a pixel anywhere in the image. If you can see any stepping of any kind, the pixel size is visible, and that means the filter is inadequate and cannot achieve “best possible output quality”. Most people are not sensitive to this at all, but I’ve sat through many filter evaluation sessions with film directors and lighting/vfx supervisors who are insanely sensitive to the differences between well tuned and closely matching Mitchell and Gaussian filters, for example. Personally, for various reasons based on past experience, I think it’s better to err slightly on the side of too blurry than too sharp. I’d rather use a Gaussian than bicubic, but the film people don’t necessarily agree and they think Gaussian is too blurry once you eliminate aliasing. Once you find the sharpest Gaussian you can that doesn’t alias, you will not be able to identify the size of a pixel - image features transition from sharp to blurry as you consider smaller scales, but pixel boundaries are not visible. I’ve never personally seen another filter that does this always, even under contrived scenarios. That said, I still think it’s tautologically true that box filter is simply not the “best” quality, even if we’re talking about very minor differences. Bilinear and Bicubic are always as good or better, even when the lay person can’t see the differences (or when they don’t know what to look for). My opinion is that there is no such thing as “best” output quality. We are in a tradeoff space, and the optimal result depends on goals that need to be stated explicitly and elaborated carefully. It depends heavily on the specific display, who/what is looking at the display, what the viewer cares about, what the surrounding environment is like, etc., etc.. * edit just to add that even though I don’t think “best” visual quality exists, I do think box filter can never get there, the contention for top spot is between the higher order filters, and box filter isn’t even in the running. I had meant to mention that even a single 2d plane that black on one side and white on the other, when rendered with box filter, yields an edge in which you can identify visible stepping. If you handle gamma & color properly, you can minimize it, but you can still see the pixels, even in this simplest of all cases. For me, that’s one reason box filter is disqualified from any discussion of high quality rendering. reply shiandow 8 hours agoparentprevIf there's one thing I've learned from image processing it's that the idea of a pixel as a perfect square is somewhat overrated. Anti-aliasing is exactly as it sounds, a low-pass filter to prevent artefacts. Convolution with a square pulse is serviceable, but is not actually that good a low-pass filter, you get all kinds of moire effects. This is why a Bicubic kernel that kind of mimics a perfect low-pass filter (which would be a sinc kernel), can perform better. It is tempting to use a square kernel though, because it's pretty much the sharpest possible method of acceptable quality. reply enriquto 10 hours agoparentprev> compute the non-overlapping areas of each polygon within each pixel In the given example (periodic checkerboard), that would be impossible because the pixels that touch the horizon intersect an infinite amount of polygons. Not that TFA solves that problem either. As far as I know the exact rendering of a periodic pattern in perspective is an open problem. reply muyyatin2 11 hours agoparentprevI've been looking into how viable this is as a performant strategy. If you have non-overlapping areas, then contributions to a single pixel can be made independently (since it is just the sum of contributions). The usual approach (computing coverage and blending into the color) is more constrained, where the operations need to be done in back-to-front order. reply mfabbri77 11 hours agorootparentI've been researching this field for 20 years (I'm one of the developers of AmanithVG). Unfortunately, no matter how fast they are made, all the algorithms to analytically decompose areas involve a step to find intersections and therefore sweepline approaches that are difficult to parallelize and therefore must be done in CPU. However, we are working on it for the next AmanithVG rasterizer, so I'm keeping my eyes open for all possible alternatives. reply muyyatin2 11 hours agorootparentI ran across https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/72935.72950 a few weeks ago, it seems like a potential non-sweepline highly-parallel method.

Computing the exact mathematical coverage of a single polygon against a background is useless for animations if you can't seamlessly stitch multiple polygons together. And that's why GPUs use multisampling: Each sample is an exact mathematical point that's covered by either polygon at the seam, without the background bleeding through. reply dahart 3 hours agoparentYou might be making some incorrect assumptions about what this article is describing. It’s not limited to a single polygon against a background. Analytic integration is always superior to multisampling, assuming the same choice of filter, and as long as the analytic integration is correct. Your comment is making an assumption that the analytic integration is incorrect in the presence of multiple polygons. This isn’t true though, the article is using multiple polygons, though the demo is limited in multiple ways for simplicity, it doesn’t appear to handle any arbitrary situation. The limitations of the demo (whether it handles overlapping polygons, stitched meshes, textures, etc.) does not have any bearing on the conceptual point that computing the pixel analytically is better than taking multiple point samples. GPUs use multisampling because it’s easy and finite to compute, not because it’s higher quality. Multisampling is lower quality than analytic, but it’s far, far easier to productize, and it’s good enough for most things (especially games). reply blauditore 9 hours agoparentprevIf you can't stitch polygons together seamlessly, how can you be sure the background doesn't bleed through with sampling? Isn't computing the exact coverage the same as having infinitely many point samples? The bleed-through of the background would then also be proportional to the gap between polygons, so if that one's small, the bleeding would be minor as well. reply codeflo 8 hours agorootparentNo, in animated models, there is no gap between polygons. And if you only compute single-polygon coverage, you can’t determine whether for two polygons that each cover 50% of a pixel, they both cover the same 50%, or complementary 50%, or anything in between. In practice, systems like that tend to show something like 25% background, 25% polygon A and 50% polygon B for the seam pixels, depending on draw order. That is, you get 25% background bleed. reply CodeVenturer 9 hours agoparentprev [–] Multisampling is key for seamless stitching in animations. The exact calculation method focuses more on achieving perfect edges in static images or vector graphics. It’s not a replacement for multisampling, just another tool depending on your needs. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "commentBody": "Markdown Is Meant to Be Shown: Stop Hiding the Syntax (2021) (daringfireball.net)131 points by SoKamil 7 hours agohidepastfavorite110 comments voidhorse 5 hours agoI think the bigger problem is that apps that don't need/shouldn't use markdown reach for it as a default and build upon it when they would have been served better investing in richer markup. Take ulysses (mentioned in the article) for example. It has grown into a full-fledged writing and word processing application, but its being based on markdown originally has only hampered that. They've had to implement all of these clunky extensions and features in terms of markdown, and as the post states, try to hide the fact that it's all markdown to make it feel more like a classic word processor. At this point it just makes the whole experience clunky. People that just want to write markdown deal with weird extensions and frustrating syntax hiding, people that don't need to learn some minimal markdown just to use a word processor... It's 2024. I hope companies start to realize that markdown is a fantastic solution for certain cases but it is not the only solution. Some applications really are better served by more complex, but much more expressive markup languages, especially if they are going to shield the user from it all anyways. reply sbuttgereit 4 hours agoparentCouldn't agree more. I find that I'll choose Markdown (assuming it's a choice) when I expect multi-modal consumption... where a given text will in some contexts simply be presented as-is using plain text and the text can also take advantage of rendering into a more styled presentation. I write in-database comments (e.g. PostgreSQL's `COMMENT ON [...]`) using Markdown for this reason. My go-to database documentation tool of choice (https://schemaspy.org) will very nicely render the Markdown into styled documentation integrated into the rest of the documentation it generates, but the plain text rendering when I'm looking at those same comments via `psql`, where no Markdown rendering is applied, still look decent due to how Markdown works. reply jasonpbecker 5 hours agoparentprevOf course you can use any number of ways to implement rich text or formatting. A lot of people want Markdown because of the portability of plain text. Markdown has served as a good mechanism for plain text formats that still can do a bit more. Ulysses would lose a significant portion of its audience if it moved to it's own syntax or some form of rich text or its own binary. A new audience would likely become interested-- though fighting Microsoft Word is ... hard to say the least. Maybe that's where Ulysses wants to go, and its own implementation of some non-standard elements suggests that. But I also know people who will not use Ulysses because of its non-standard Markdown elements resulting in files that are less portable. reply j1elo 4 hours agoparentprevUlysses? Take an app with a MUCH wider audience: WhatsApp! They use Markdown-esque syntax for message formatting. It mostly is Markdown, with a single caveat that gets me a lot: *Single asterisks* become bold, instead of italic. For italics, you have to use _underscores_. Other syntax works fine. Slack also uses Markdown. In summary that's nice as it is just one single syntax to remember across systems. I wouldn't enjoy too much that every app started having its own different, more expressive syntax, at least not for apps which their primary job is communication, not text edition. reply chrismorgan 4 hours agorootparent> Slack also uses Markdown. No it doesn't. It uses something they call mrkdwn, which is only vaguely superficially similar to Markdown. In most important places, mrkdwn has made different decisions from Markdown. It's a completely different, and far more rudimentary, Lightweight Markup Language. reply riffic 4 hours agorootparentit's better than whatever Microsoft Teams makes you use. reply saratogacx 1 hour agorootparentTeams (and I believe Slack too) uses what I call MS Word formatting (They call it \"Auto format as you type\"). A lot of the markup you can do in teams came from elements that do the same in Word/Outlook/etc. reply voidUpdate 4 hours agorootparentprevIt really annoys me that services can't decide if * is bold or italics. It makes the most sense to me as italics, so when I use whatsapp or youtube I always get annoyed that it did the wrong one reply cwillu 3 hours agorootparentI can't comprehend why * wouldn't be bold. Given that underlining is how you italics when you can't italics, _ makes perfect sense. reply digging 3 hours agorootparent> Given that underlining is how you italics when you can't italics In my experience underlining is how you bold when you can't bold. reply JoshTriplett 3 hours agorootparentIn my experience, underscores are how you underline when you can't underline. Asterisks are emphasis, which is typically italics. reply kccqzy 1 hour agorootparentThat's completely true, but emphasis is normally rendered by italics too. (See for example theelement in HTML with the default CSS.) Emphasis is the semantic, italics is the presentation. From this perspective both underscores and single asterisks should render into italics. reply JoshTriplett 1 hour agorootparent> emphasis is normally rendered by italics too I wasn't disagreeing with that; edited my comment to be clear. Asterisks are emphasis; emphasis is typically italics. I do think that underscores should have been underlining, but unfortunately that's not what Markdown chose. reply gowld 3 minutes agorootparentprevCAPS is how you bold when you can't bold. cwillu 2 hours agorootparentprevFWIW, https://style.mla.org/underscore-instead-of-italics/ reply zo1 1 hour agorootparentprev* was to bold or to emphasize stuff way before markdown was even a thing. That's how I remember the early days of the web in the early 0's. reply Fomite 1 hour agorootparentI think the issue is \"bold *or* emphasize\". There's not a universal consensus on whether or not emphasis is italics or bold. reply eyjafjallajokul 1 hour agorootparentprevSee also: Imperial v/s Metric. :-) reply slightwinder 3 hours agorootparentprevMarkdown is build on popular custom syntax from mails and other message-platforms. WhatsApp is probably doing the same. Similar problem exist with all the other simple markup-languages, doing the same. At the end, there is only limited syntax available for those cases, those they are destined to have similarities and duplicates. reply playingalong 1 hour agorootparentprevWait. In my Slack asterisks mean bold too. reply gkoberger 5 hours agoprevOne thing I love about being able to see the syntax when editing is that you know what's about to happen. A backspace will always delete the previous key; you won't end up in a situation where you're deleting a whole block of content. And when you type, you know if the cursor is on the left or right side of the \"*\", whereas in WYSIWYG it could be on either side of the invisible change from bold to regular. It's much more relaxing for me to write in Markdown, because I don't have to think about the mode I'm in or how to get out of a small pickle. Everything is just a character. I don't think Markdown is for everything. Microsoft Word is not a Markdown editor, and most people are better served by a WYSIWYG editor. But for writing content, I always prefer personally to write in markdown (and to see the syntax), since it's easier to focus more on writing and less on the editor. reply svachalek 1 hour agoparentThe thing where backspace magically reformats half your document is so frustrating. I wonder if Word's solved it as it's been decades since I've used that, but it seems like pretty much anything else I use still has that issue. reply ximm 4 hours agoparentprevYou haven't dealt with bidirectional text yet, have you? reply gkoberger 4 hours agorootparentI feel like that's a hard problem no matter what, and doesn't negate my personal preference for using markdown when writing longform content? reply fenomas 2 hours agoprevRelated: given that markdown is meant to be read, it kind of drives me up the wall that some people nowadays run autoformatters like Prettier on it. Super-aggressive formatters like prettier remove various whitespace, and mangle other things that human authors do for readability. Which is fine if the file is something that's only ever meant to be parsed by scripts, but the whole point of markdown is that people read it! (edited to add: It wouldn't really be an issue if prettier had some config options for not mangling whitespace, but that ship seems to have sailed for some reason.) reply diwank 2 hours agoparentYes! I sometimes prefer to use `====` h1s and `----` h2s especially when I am writing slides or taking notes on a live call for others and I hate that prettier and other linters would automatically turn them into `# ` and `## ` ... Please stop doing that, prettier. reply bastawhiz 1 hour agoparentprev> Which is fine if the file is something that's only ever meant to be parsed by scripts, but the whole point of markdown is that people read it! Nobody is running prettier on their code or markup for the benefit of the computer. If it's not readable, it's just a bad formatting tool (or wasn't configured properly). The whole point of a formatter is to make it easier to read. reply fenomas 49 minutes agorootparentPrettier disagrees, as I understand it. Its authors know it's \"wrong\" to take this: const matrix = [ 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ] and collapse it onto one line. But their view is that reformatting everything from scratch is more important that such things, and that it's reasonable to add /* ignore */ comments to every single place where you want anything preserved. reply Shog9 55 minutes agorootparentprevPretty much the only benefit I've seen of running prettier on Markdown is to highlight mistakes in formatting that otherwise wouldn't be apparent without viewing rendered output (which it highlights mostly by trashing the file in some fairly obvious way). The stated philosophy behind Prettier is to end arguments within a team about how to format code, which... Given Markdown is already heavily constrained, barely applies; unlike other languages supported by Prettier, there are precious few adjustments made to Markdown that are clearly intentionally made in pursuit of consistent readability - indeed, if I recall correctly the Prettier Markdown engine is mostly just a round-trip through the remark.js parser and stringifier, and the results reflect this - the results look mechanical, and it is just as likely to eliminate whitespace that lends clarity as it is to add it (if not, as the GP suggests, more likely). Sadly, there are remark.js plugins that could have been used to e.g. enforce consistent use of whitespace without stripping everything down to the bare minimum, but last I looked the Prettier folk were pretty hostile toward any suggestions that their (default, bare-minimum-effort) \"style\" was at all problematic. reply The_Colonel 2 hours agoparentprevWell, Markdown is a superset of HTML where extra whitespace is usually collapsed, so this behavior isn't surprising. Having \"source\" Markdown looking meaningfully different from the rendered Markdown seems like an anti-pattern. reply Shog9 1 hour agorootparentAs the essay and this discussion repeatedly try to emphasize, thinking of Markdown as a \"superset of HTML\" is missing the point - it is meant to be read. It has both meaningful and collapsible whitespace, and both allows and encourages uses of whitespace that only have a significant effect on source readability. ...Arguably, the reason HTML has collapsible whitespace is to allow writing readable source, and once upon a time it was more common to see HTML produced in a way that didn't get in the way of this (e.g. paragraphs and indentation indicated primarily via whitespace with only opening `` and `` tags). But that ship sailed; tooling long ago coalesced around more rigid conventions, and thus the need for Markdown emerged. Throwing those advantages away raises the question of why bother using Markdown at all. reply msf1024 5 hours agoprevThe reason I write in markdown is because it is fast and keyboard-driven. I don't want to see it when I'm looking at my notes or editing them. The idea that it is meant to be seen is no more than a personal preference. reply Slackwise 4 hours agoparent> because it is fast and keyboard-driven How is it faster to press `*` than `Ctrl-I` in any other rich text editor? > The idea that it is meant to be seen is no more than a personal preference. Actually, the entire philosophy of Markdown is that, even if you didn't process it into HTML or some form of rich text, it uses common conventions that have been used across Usenet, IRC, and plaintext files for years, and is thus readable without ever being processed. In fact, you can likely take various plaintext files and process them and they'll gain many incidental markups and highlights. Meaning, Markdown is Markdown without needing to be turned into HTML or rich text. It is, in itself, a great way to universally markup text as people have been doing online for years. reply kragen 1 hour agorootparenti haven't pushed it to github yet, but i have a keybinding for alt-* similar to the alt-` binding at https://github.com/kragen/kragen-.emacs.d/blob/master/init.e... which italicizes the previous word. that way, to italicize a single word, which is the most common case, i only have to press alt-* once. successive presses expand the italicized region leftwards over more words (this happens whenever the cursor is directly to the right of a *; it isn't activated by an invisible bit that remembers whether the previous command was also an alt-*) (it also ought to italicize the selection when there's an active selection, but i haven't implemented that yet) i think this is a superior interaction paradigm to the paradigm where ctrl-i sets an italics mode that doesn't visibly change anything near the cursor, but affects the future text you type. that design not only usually requires more keystrokes but causes mode errors. this is how ctrl-i and ctrl-b should always have worked, and if larry tesler had thought of the idea by 01983, that's how they always would have worked however, the keystroke ctrl-i is easier to type than the keystroke alt-* reply watwut 3 hours agorootparentprevYou need to highlight first and only then to press ctrl-I. So yes, typing is faster if you do it a lot. reply scintill76 3 hours agorootparentYou may not be aware that Ctrl-I toggles the mode of new text, not just selected text. I think that poster was saying this: If you're writing a new sentence in MSWord, you type \"Emphasize words like this.\" If you write a new sentence in Markdown, you type \"Emphasize words *like this*.\" The keys are neighbors even, at least in a US keyboard layout, so there is not a reason most US users would say it's \"faster\" to type * than Ctrl-I. (And if other layout users disagree, okay, but I don't think that was in the scope of the original point.) reply TeMPOraL 3 hours agorootparentI think in practice, people write \"Emphasize words like this.\", then*, then*. At least I myself usually add markup immediately after writing the words to be marked up. The problem with Word-like editor styling is exactly that the boundaries are invisible, and the style is applied destructively to everything within highlighted range, instead of non-destructively by the range itself. What I mean is, if in the example above, I want to change the emphasis to only italicize \"this\", I can kill the first * and place it a word later. In Word-style editing, I'll have to highlight the whole \"like \" sequence and un-italicize it, hoping I didn't miss a space or a dot that invisibly retains the italics and then screw up editing for you down the line. reply g15jv2dp 2 hours agorootparent> I think in practice, people write \"Emphasize words like this.\", then, then.

Does Backspace turn \"italic\" into \"*italic\"? reply ixwt 5 hours agorootparentI personally like the way that Obsidian and Typora hide the styling: when you get to where it would be, it shows up on screen to show you it's there causing the styling. When your typing indicator moves away from it, it hides it. Some don't like it because it can cause some displacement of text a bit because it's now showing characters it didn't before. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 5 hours agorootparentI found Obsidian’s way of doing it to be a bit jarring at first but now that I’ve used it for awhile I personally quite like it. Just takes a little while of getting used to reply Sylamore 57 minutes agorootparentprevNot a user of either of those but that sounds an awful lot like \"Reveal Codes\" from WordPerfect which saved my ass more than once when formatting got screwed up in a document. reply cnity 5 hours agorootparentprevYou could probably do this in a way that doesn't trigger text reflow if a popover appeared with the visible syntax exactly positioned such that the extra syntax slightly obscured surrounding text. It's a tradeoff but I think that might be slicker. reply diwank 2 hours agorootparentprevIt does on a lot of editors and I hate it. On my vim the highlights only get added/removed when I switch back to normal mode, during editing nothing changes except for the actual keystrokes. reply wccrawford 5 hours agorootparentprevI've seen editors do it that way, and if you know what it looks like in your head, it works quite well, IMO. I can't imagine how it works for people who aren't pretty good at the syntax. reply g15jv2dp 2 hours agorootparentprevCtrl+Z reply Doctor_Fegg 1 hour agoprev> I have no idea why there are now apps that use Markdown as their back end storage format but only show styled text without the Markdown source code visible. Because backend storage of rich text is not a solved problem? RTF is a horrid, over-complex serialisation. Some platforms have their own internal format for rich text (e.g. NSAttributedString) but serialisation is either lacking or platform-specific. Writing as WYSIWYG but storing in the backend as Markdown is not an insane idea, and I say that as someone whose muscle memory has been cmd-B/cmd-I since 1992 and would never choose to actually compose in Markdown unless I had to. reply taeric 3 hours agoprevOh wow. From headline, I first thought this meant that viewing a markdown document should show me the markup. Which falls on its face with images and links, of course. No, this is about editing the document. And... I confess I'm confused on why folks would want the opposite? WYSIWYG is, of course, a thing and popular for many reasons. So, I can see having the option to operate in that way. But a huge benefit of markup languages of any kind is that I can see the markup. Fully agreed that I should be able to see it. reply thinkling 2 hours agoparentI use markdown for note-taking. I do as much reading as editing, and they're generally intertwined. I don't want to switch between \"view mode\" and \"edit mode\". I want to be able to embed links but not have the document become cluttered with long, ugly URLs. I want to use headlines and bulleted lists and have them auto-formatted. I also want to keep my notes in a 100% portable human-readable format. (No MS Word, no Bear, no Evernote, etc.) For my use, the best solution is an app that shows me the formatted (styled) output, until I navigate the insertion point into it, and then expands the text to show the formatting. Obsidian is an app that does this. I don't love other parts of it, but the editing experience works well. (What I really want is the search/browse experience of nvUltra with the editing experience and cross-platform presence of Obsidian.) reply kragen 1 hour agorootparentthis only partially addresses your complaint, but you may or may not be aware that markdown has an option to put urls in footnotes, which you can put anywhere in the file: (This is part of the background work for [Monnier’s paper with him about Elisp’s history][3] for HOPL ’20.) ... [3]: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3386324 (Evolution of Emacs Lisp, by Stefan Monnier and Michael Sperber) in my .emacs.d/init.el i wrote a command https://github.com/kragen/kragen-.emacs.d/blob/master/init.e... which inserts such a footnote link, linking the previous word to the link pasted from the clipboard. it auto-increments the footnote counter, initially setting it higher than any numbered footnote it finds in the file. i have it bound to the fairly horrible key ctrl-alt-]; successive presses of the key expand the link leftwards to include more words (it ought to use the selection as the link text if there is one, and to find an existing block of footnotes to add the footnote to if there is one, but i haven't implemented those features) the upshot of this is that in the above, after typing 'history', i pressed ctrl-alt-] and kept pressing ] until the link had engulfed monnier's name emacs markdown-mode does also automatically syntax-highlight links, headers, bulleted lists, italic, bold, typewriter code, and markdown linebreaks, and it has a command (the also rather horrible keybinding ctrl-c ctrl-o) to open a link. if the link is to a local file, it opens it in emacs rather than your browser. it also uses the tab key to expand and collapse headers, and of course it always has emacs's instantaneous full-text search. but the formatting is much uglier than obsidian's reply taeric 1 hour agorootparentprevThis sounds like an agreement, then?

I find having the text jump around because it became bold or italicized distracting, and it's even worse when a header is suddenly a larger size and everything below it is pushed down the screen. Markdown is simple, and I like working with it simply. I suppose there is some value in having the more complicated aspects, like images and tables, checked for syntax so you can see if you've made a mistake, but I run a macro to generate those anyway, so I'm fairly confident in the result. reply diwank 2 hours agoparentYep but to me this feels like a lot of poor ux decisions too. I would def appreciate the visual indicators of italics and bold text but ffsake please dont toggle it every time I add a bloody keystroke. It's so jarring when editors do that.

Otherwise, if the usecase is consumption you are better to show the generated output. reply jessriedel 1 hour agoparentYes, the blog post could have made it clearer that the author was talking about editing mode only. (His wording was “meant to be visible to the writer”.) The issue, of course, is when the writer is also the reader, such as for the note-taking apps. It’s not always clear then what mode the user wants to be in. I’m pretty happy with the compromise struck by Bear, which does some of what the author is complaining about. Bear’s technique is to show the formatting (i.e., hide the markdown syntax) for everything except the “word” (contiguous non-white-space) that you are currently editing, as determined by the location of your cursor. This lets you edit the markdown directly, ASCII-character-by-ASCII-character, but the rest of the doc looks pretty. It’s not perfect, but hiccups are rare and I find it vastly better than the alternatives: (1) a conventional WYSIWYG editor or (2) a hard distinction between writing and reading mode that the user needs to constantly toggle actively as they use their notes. But it seems fine to me that different users prefer any of these options. reply filcuk 5 hours agoparentprevYeah, I'm happy I can edit via markdown and fallback on it if the site is down, for example, but I see no benefit to intentionally making it less readable when reading/presenting. reply bastawhiz 1 hour agoprevIf you only care to expose limited formatting to the user, whether the file is stored in Markdown or not is immaterial. It could be stored in Word 2003 DOC format and export to Markdown, and if the serialization and deserialization are faithful, it doesn't matter at all. Markdown is portable, fast, safe, and simple. Being able to dump your data as Markdown (which you know works, because the Markdown version is the literal source of truth) means you're guaranteed to be able to extract your data and move it wherever you want with perfect fidelity. That's a huge bonus. The argument here is pointless if your concern isn't the syntax: Markdown _as a serialization format_ versus Markdown _as a typeable syntax_ are two separate concerns. The UX of a tool meant for editing Markdown is going to be extremely different than a tool to edit simple rich text. In my own app, I default to WYSIWYG with an option to edit the raw markdown (for podcast show notes, which have very limited formatting options). Why? Because the alternative is HTML and that sucks to write by hand (especially if you can't use most tags). reply ericyd 5 hours agoprev> Trust me, it’s meant to be shown.

Perhaps this will be ok. But, after about 10 minutes, I show them that `# Header` is how you make a header. Their disdain is now total...How dare I imply that a hashtag implies a header. This is hard. Then, I show them a link. \"It's just like this\", I say: `(https://example.com)[example link]`. \"You'll get used to it.\" Finally, the client pounds his fists on the table. \"That's CODING DAMMIT.

Mind you, a proper encoding of a WYSIWYG format, and corresponding tooling, will be better... but for quick-and-dirty that normally works well, Markdown is ultimately pretty good (unfortunately, in my opinion). reply eslaught 1 hour agoprevI guess I'll defend the minority opinion. For context, I write over 100k words a year. That's something like 150 pages depending on how you format it. This includes both technical documents (which I mainly do in Latex) and more traditional long-form writing (which I do in Markdown). For technical documents, formatting is very much a key part of the presentation, so I want to see the markup. I mainly use Emacs and I render the PDF from the terminal when I want to see it. Fidelity to the final result is essential, so I don't bother with Latex IDEs (unless I'm doing collaborative editing on Overleaf). For my long-form writing, I want the markup to get out of the way. I use Markdown because it's simple and portable and generates a large number of formats (via Pandoc); that does NOT mean that I want the asterisks and hash signs and so on staring me in the face. Also, frankly, it's just easier to write when the text looks pretty. For most of this writing I write in Typora (with a nice variable-width font), and then edit in Emacs with the generated PDF side-by-side. Why bother with Markdown at all? Because Word ultimately gets in the way of me producing nice documents. The fact that I can move my cursor to see exactly what the markup is, and that this markup is simple and straightforward and maps well into what I'm trying to generate, helps me focus on content and avoid distractions. Word has far too many knobs, far too many ways to do something that looks visually correct but generates the wrong markup (especially when you're going to do post-processing in some other tool), and really hinders refactoring (when you need to make global style changes). So I use Markdown, but again, that doesn't mean I want markup staring me in the face. I'm not sure why people are so incredulous that this is a desirable goal? I mean it should be pretty obvious that the apps would not exist if there wasn't a market for it, so clearly I'm not the only one who feels this way. reply Y-bar 6 hours agoprevI am currently trying to fit Obsidian into my workflow as a note taking app, and this is one of my main gripes about the app. Another being that it does not integrate well with the operating system spell checking, so adding a word elsewhere to the system dictionary does not reflect in Obsidian, and the other way around. reply bachmeier 5 hours agoparentObsidian has both live preview and source mode.

And I think some of them, like tables, code blocks or modern link-style, weren't even part of the original markdown. And the reason I prefer Markdown, is because it's not proprietary, and Obsidian, my preferred Markdown-Tool, has a different workflow than the usual WYSIWYG-Tools. If Obsidian would use json or yaml for everything, I would still use it.

As someone who contributed a bit to the early CommonMark spec I think some of us were really doing it the shitty way towards Gruber. How would the Rust people react if we created a \"Standard Rust\" language? reply kaoD 1 hour agorootparentThe usage of the word \"copyright\" made me wonder... can you even copyright Markdown? I don't think you can, can you? You can copyright the spec (if any) or the reference implementation, but you cannot copyright the concept or syntax itself. You could maybe patent Markdown (given the amount of trash software patents I've seen I wouldn't be surprised) but (1) it's not patented AFAIK and (2) it's become so common (mark, heh) that I don't think it could be patented anymore. You could say Markdown is covered as a trademark even if not officially registered maybe? I don't know the specifics though, could anyone chime in? (this is complicated further by the different jurisdictions). But my understanding of the general idea is that if your trademark becomes common (which I guess happened?) or you don't actively defend it (which is what Gruber was trying to do fighting Standard Markdown), you lose it. So, to summarize, I think he was right to be angry (in a moral way) but that's possibly the only right he had in the literal sense. Which is more than enough of course. reply LordDragonfang 1 hour agorootparentprev> if I would take your copyrighted work https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ >Markdown is free software, available under a BSD-style open source license.

This is exactly how fsf is supposed to work. reply Y-bar 48 minutes agorootparentYou are unfortunately making the same incorrect conclusion many of us did back then. It was about the _Name_ , never about the syntax/implementation.

With a small amount of data and minimal training, it can achieve better results. The online experience, See the site here The model begins by processing the audio signal through a U-Net, which isolates the vocal track. The vocal track is then simultaneously fed into PitchNet and HuBERT (Wav2Vec2). PitchNet is responsible for extracting pitch features, while HuBERT captures detailed features of the vocals. The core of the model is CombineNet, which receives features from the Features module. This module consists of three spectrograms: STFT, MFCC, and Chroma, each extracting different aspects of the audio. These features are enhanced by the TimbreBlock before being passed to the Encoder. During this process, noise is introduced via STFT transformation and combined with the features before entering the Encoder for processing. The processed features are then passed to the Decoder, where they are combined with the previous features to generate the final audio output. CombineNet is based on an encoder-decoder architecture and is trained to generate a mask that is used to extract and replace the timbre, ultimately producing the final output audio. The entire AI-powered process is implemented in run.py, while the various network structure models can be referenced in the models folder.

I tried making some AI covers, too, which was kind of fun. For one of my tries, I submitted Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit for AI voice generation to make a cover of Carola's song \"Främling\" (Sweden's ESC song 1983 which came in third, a very non-Nirvana-type of song). At first, I thought the voice sounded pretty much like a Swedish Kurt Cobain, then the more I listened to it, all I could hear was the Swedish artist Nordman, and it dawned upon me that they have similar voice styles. I tried lowering the pitch, and then I was certain I recognised the voice from another artist but couldn't place it.

Apple contributes nothing to their work, but it will get to steal a third of their wages: https://news.patreon.com/articles/understanding-apple-requirements-for-patreon How is this possible? Enshittification: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel Enshittification starts with companies being good to their end users. In this case, Apple made a high quality product – the Iphone and Ipad – and carefully tended to its App Store. That lured in a lot of customers, many of whom made owning an Apple device part of their very identity, as though buying a popular brand of consumer electronics made them part of an oppressed religious minority: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones At the same time, Apple was locking those users in, selling them media that they couldn't play on non-Apple devices and tying their use of a mobile phone to their email, two-factor authentication, family photos, working files and consumer credit. Apple also avidly participated in the expansion of \"IP law,\" which is to say, \"laws that let Apple control the conduct of its customers, critics and competitors\": https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/ In particular, Apple fought for a bizarre and expansive understanding of Section 1201 of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. That's a law that makes it a felony to help someone jailbreak a device, even if this doesn't lead to a single instance of copyright infringement. Once removing a digital lock becomes a crime, then Apple can make anything into a crime – if Apple designs your device so that doing something you desire requires disabling a lock, and then doing that thing becomes illegal. For example, Apple designs its phones so that they won't accept new parts without a manufacturer-supplied unlock code. That means that even if you install an Apple part in your Apple phone, it won't work unless you get Apple's permission (not cheap!) to activate that part. This is called \"parts pairing\" and it's pure rent-seeking, and Oregon just outlawed it: https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/27/24097042/right-to-repair-law-oregon-sb1596-parts-pairing-tina-kotek-signed The reason Oregon had to ban parts-pairing is that bypassing parts-pairing is a felony under DMCA 1201, punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine. That means you can't just buy a tool that some clever reverse-engineer made that fakes the parts-pairing code – not because this is technically impossible, but because it is very, very illegal. DMCA 1201 gives Apple broad latitude to control how you can use your $1,000 phone. DMCA 1201 is why you can't just grab a little $0.99 dongle in the Walmart checkout line that jailbreaks your phone and lets you install a different app store. It's not against the law for an app author to sell you an app without Apple's blessing. It's not illegal for you to run an app you buy on your phone without Apple's blessing. But the technical step needed to let you run software you buy on a gadget you own is a felony, so all those activities become de facto felonies. Jay Freeman calls this \"felony contempt of business model\" – but you could also call it \"private law.\" In passing DMCA 1201, Congress said to companies like Apple, \"Just add a digital lock to anything you make, and then you can create felonies out of thin air, which the US courts will prosecute on your behalf.\" This is the Bizarro-world version of \"Chevron deference,\" the idea that expert agencies, deputized by Congress to fairly and neutrally enforce the law, should have latitude to interpret Congressional intent. So, for example, even if Congress never specifically banned putting rat poison in kids' breakfast cereal, the FDA should still be allowed to make a \"no strychnine in the Fruity Pebbles\" rule. This is a common-sense proposition, but back in July, the Supreme Court killed it: https://prospect.org/justice/supreme-court-stages-coup-against-government-regulation/ So regulators are no longer allowed to regulate, but, thanks to DMCA 1201, corporations can just make up rules out of thin air and give them the force of both criminal and civil statute. The government can't govern, but corporations can. The fact that it's a felony to get your Iphone apps from anyone except Apple means that whatever policies Apple makes for the app store have the force of law. Apple's pristine execution of stage one of enshittification – luring in users, then locking those users in – mean that businesses can't survive without reaching Apple customers, and they can't reach Apple customers without abiding by the app store's rules. Remember when Tumblr banned pornography? It was a bizarre shitshow, especially given how important non-heteronormative, non-vanilla porn had been to Tumblr. To many Tumblr users, this looked like a rehash of the old pattern: get big by courting adult performers and sex workers, then kick the people who built your platform to the curb once you've attained scale. There's a lot of truth to that: under Yahoo and Verizon's ownership, Tumblr clearly didn't give a damn about its users, especially the sex workers (and that went double for the world of queer sex). But even after Tumblr was bought by WordPress, and even after WordPress did its best to restore some adult content to the platform, Tumblr still remains heavily moderated and heavily censored. Why? Because Apple kept kicking Tumblr out of the App Store on the basis that it contained sexual material, and without Apple users, Tumblr was dead in the water: https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/29/go-nuts-show-nuts/#chokepoints This is Apple's \"private law\" – Apple is using its \"IP\" (DMCA 1201, which lets it prevent its customers from choosing rival app stores) to reach beyond the walls of its own offices and into the offices of Tumblr, dictating Tumblr's standards for sexually explicit material. Apple claims this is merely a matter of \"editorial standards,\" no different from a bookstore deciding not to shelve pornography. The difference is that in this case, Apple can block you from patronizing another bookstore, by forcing you to forfeit the $1,000 you spent on your device and potentially many thousands more in media and data and other switching costs. But that's not the end of Apple's ability to regulate the market. Apple doesn't enforce its ban on adult content equally. If Tumblr allows adult content, it gets kicked out of the app store. But Apple chooses not to enforce its sexual material ban against Reddit or Twitter, where the policy is \"go nuts, show nuts.\" Apple's choosing the winners and the losers here, creating the \"market distortion\" that conservatives warn us against. Which brings me back to Patreon. Apple's content-based rules are mere ornaments on Apple's core market-structuring activity. The main event is Apple's 30% App Store Tax. Apple skims a 30% vig off the price of the apps you buy, and everything you buy in them: https://pluralistic.net/2024/03/22/reality-distortion-field/#three-trillion-here-three-trillion-there-pretty-soon-youre-talking-real-money This is a shocking payment processing fee. For comparison, the highly concentrated credit-card sector charges 2-5% to process a payment – a tenth of Apple's charge. What's more, that 2-5% credit card fee is considered to be extremely high (it's gone up 40% since covid started). Apple backstops this payment rule with more content-based rules: app vendors may not send customers to the web to complete their payments through a regular website with a 2-5% fee. Users have to figure this out for themselves. Again, Apple picks winners and losers in this market. Not every app has to pay this fee – for example, Uber is exempted from it. But smaller ridehailing apps – say, one created by a driver co-op – gets soaked for the full amount, meaning that it can't possibly compete against Uber. Apple is effectively crowning Uber the perpetual overlord of ride-hailing apps. Apple also uses this market regulating power to scoop up parts of the market for itself. Apple directly competes with many of its vendors, selling books, music, videos, audiobooks and other digital media, as well as email, mass storage, photo storage, etc. Apple's rivals have to kick a 30% vig up to the Apple Crime Family, but Apple exempts itself from those fees. Again, Apple is picking the winner in the market – itself. It's not just businesses that compete with Apple that get wiped out by Apple's position as de facto supreme planner of the economy. Many businesses simply can't exist in a world in which 30% of their revenue is creamed off by another business. For that matter, Apple couldn't survive under that regime. As Slashdot's theodp writes, Apple netted $97b on revenues of $383b last year. If Apple had to pay a 30% app store tax on that gross revenue, it would be down $115b, for a net loss of $18b: https://apple.slashdot.org/story/24/08/13/1439258/ask-slashdot-could-apple-survive-if-it-had-to-pay-a-30-apple-tax?sbsrc=md Here we have Apple as the fully unfurled regulator of the digital economy. Apple decides what kinds of businesses are prohibited, based on three criteria: I. Does Apple want to compete with them? II. Do they carry sexually explicit material without being Twitter or Reddit? III. Are they an otherwise viable business that doesn't have an extra 30% margin they can afford to give away to Apple? Apple doesn't oppose regulation; Apple loves regulation, so long as they're the ones doing the regulating. They want to be able to shape and define the digital market, backed by the power of the state, but without any input from the state. In modern corporate orthodoxy, the state is an enforcer for corporate will. That's the animating force behind \"binding arbitration\" waivers, the now-ubiquitous contract terms that require you to give up your right to sue no matter what the other party does to you. These waivers are in your phone contract, your employment contract, your travel tickets, your concert tickets, your doctor's office forms, and the terms for most services: https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/12/hot-coffee/#mcgeico By forcing you to click \"OK\" to a binding arbitration waiver, corporations transform the courts from entities that interpret and enforce the law to entities that force the public to surrender every right and protection Congress ever gave them, in favor of the unilateral decisions of a corporate arbitrator paid by the company that wronged them. This is more private law – the state existing as an enforcer for the whims and fiat of corporate strategists. It's a terribly neat illustration of Wilhoit's law, \"Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect\": https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288 Just like the digital locks lurking in your Iphone, you are subject to thousands of unseen and unsuspected binding arbitration waivers buried deep in fine print you have never read. You will only discover the existence of these waivers when you are horribly wronged, whereupon the company that hurt you will produce the waiver and force you to surrender your legal right to redress. The latest example of this is the viral story of a lawsuit brought against Disney by the widower of a doctor who died at Walt Disney World after being fed a meal containing allergens that she had been assured would not be present in her food: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/disney-fighting-restaurant-death-suit-with-disney-terms-absurd-lawyer-says/ Disney has filed a motion seeking to have the widower's case dismissed because he signed up for a free trial of the Disney+ streaming service, and in so doing, \"agreed\" to permanently give up his right to sue Disney for anything: https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-05-31-Defendant-Walt-Disney-Parks-and-Resorts-Motion-to-Compel-Arbitration-and-Stay-Case.pdf This is every bit as much market-structuring conduct as Apple's insistence that only Patreon performers who have an extra 30% in their monthly payments can go on making art. Liability rules – like a rule that makes corporations liable if they kill you by feeding you allergens they've promised not to feed you – are a key part of how we structure markets. By allowing customers who've been wronged, cheated or harmed to seek financial compensation in civil court, Congress created a system of incentives designed to shape the conduct of firms (the alternative is the prohibitively expensive prospect of having on-site round-the-clock inspectors, a measure reserved for a few sensitive industries like meat-packing plants, and, in a wildly imperfect fashion, Boeing). When a company unilaterally removes your ability to access the courts – while preserving its own right to have the courts force you to seek justice from its arbitrators – they incinerate every regulation, every law, and replace it with \"whatever we feel like.\" The law protects them, it binds you. We live in the felony contempt of business model dystopia, where multinational corporations decide which laws apply and when; and where they get to decide who can be in business, and what kind of business they can do.

This distinction seems completely arbitrary to me. I suspect the only reason it exists is that adding a 30% Apple surcharge to every Amazon purchase would cause too much outrage. Disclaimer: I've never used Temu or the Amazon app, but I'm assuming they don't apply a 30% surcharge on physical goods on iOS. reply Doches 5 hours agoparentApp Store policy (written or otherwise? It's hard to say.) only levies the 30% on digital goods delivered in the app. Uber, for example, doesn't pay 30% of rider fees to Apple. Patreon is in this weird gray area because you kinda-sorta are getting digital goods delivered via the Patreon app, depending on how you look at it. And obviously if there's a way that Apple can squint and say it falls under their purview, they will... reply knowriju 4 hours agoparentprevPlaying the devil's advocate here, I believe the rational to take 30% cut for only digital goods is that, usually digital goods have zero marginal cost. To 'manufacture' an additional digital asset, the company doesn't need to spend anything extra. This assumption starts breaking as internet becomes more ubiquitous and for anything really outside gaming coins. Example, for every additional Spotify subscriber, Spotify needs to pay music producers as well. The economics is now very close to physical goods being sold in Temu or Amazon. reply saurik 2 hours agorootparentThis doesn't work for Patreon, which often isn't merely about \"digital assets\": while some people on Patreon might be using it to merely sell access to some digital portfolio, many (I'd even say \"most\") use it as a form of VIP club system, with direct access to the artist, custom work products, physical swag that you receive in the mail, shoutouts during live shows... Patreon isn't a system that inherently scales with anything close to zero marginal cost, at least for most of the tiers of most of the artists I've seen on the platform. reply jacobp100 4 hours agoparentprevDigital goods and tips are required to use IAPs and pay the fee. Patreon is either one or the other, or maybe a mix of both. I suspect this has been published more than they anticipated, and they’ll have to allow tips to use external payment systems. reply brigadier132 5 hours agoparentprev> What's the conceptual difference between Apple charging 30% for Patreon subcribers vs. charging 30% for purchases on Temu or the Amazon app? I can name more than 1 competitor to Amazon. reply II2II 4 hours agorootparentDepending upon how you look at it, there is more than one competitor to Apple. It kinda sucks that most of the competition to iOS runs one operating system, yet that one operating system is supported by multiple hardware vendors and multiple online storefronts. Yet there is also another competitor to Apple on iOS devices. It is called the web. Patreon in no way owes money to Apple if the end user fires up a web browser on their phone and makes their contribution through the website. Argue all that you want about convenience, and you're probably right on that front, but it is a way to circumvent Apple to have more of your contribution delivered to the intended recipient. In the end, the decision of iOS users to support Apple's practices are at issue here. Sometimes you just have to say no using whatever means are at your disposal. reply AlexandrB 5 hours agorootparentprevOf course, but I don't use shopping apps so I don't know who does or does not have an app. Temu just comes to mind because of their dismal reputation and obnoxious marketing. reply brigadier132 5 hours agorootparentI don't think you get it because you wouldn't have asked the question in the first place if you did. If there is actual competition in a market, the surplus generated by economic transactions is more fairly distributed by the participants in the transaction. When there is competition, businesses also need to compete and improve their products to drive efficiencies (for better margins) and to make the product more attractive to buyers. Because Apple is in a monopoly position, the only way to sell to Apple device users is via their app store. If you want to sell on their App store you need to give apple 30% of revenue. To be clear, Apple does not provide 30% of the value here. This 30% is pure rent seeking, once the app is installed Apple provides 0 value. If you really wanted to equate Apple and Amazon, it would be like Amazon taking 30% of the initial transaction then forcing all revenue generated from products sold on Amazon to give 30% of revenue in perpetuity to them. reply AlexandrB 4 hours agorootparentAt no point was I equating Apple and Amazon. I was asking why Apple doesn't collect 30% from Amazon (which Amazon would naturally pass on to consumers) when people buy goods from Amazon's iOS app. My entire point is that this distinction seems increasingly arbitrary on Apple's part and is perhaps driven by the expected outrage if they tried to pull the same stunt with retailers like Amazon or Temu. reply chii 2 hours agorootparent> driven by the expected outrage if they tried to pull the same stunt with retailers which is pretty good evidence that society should pass a law to disallow apple from doing it (rather than let them pick and choose to charge a subset small enough to bypass public outrage, but still rake in an undeserved tax on apple device users)! reply jhanschoo 4 hours agoparentprevWhile the blog post stresses the 30% fee, I read the Patreon post that it was responding to. I am subscribed to a couple infrequent but high-quality creators on Patreon who charge by deliverable instead of as a monthly subscription that won't make sense since months may go by without a deliverable. This will make monetization via Patreon unviable for them. reply mensetmanusman 1 hour agoparentprevSo it sounds like someone should make a Patreon page that renders a video of someone ordering what you want on Amazon, that will help Apple get a 30% markup on Amazon purchases. reply mikehearn 4 hours agoprev\"Every artist, performer and creator on Patreon is about to get screwed out of 30% of their gross revenue\" Does Apple have access to Patreon creators' gross revenue? I thought they only charged commissions on payments through IAP, which I assumed is only a minority of their overall gross. reply barryrandall 4 hours agoprevIt seems like Apple needs to be split up into separate Services, Devices, and Marketplace companies. reply pentagrama 3 hours agoprevI agree with some opinions and the sentiment of this article, but in some parts the author, perhaps unintentionally, makes false or misleading claims to simply provoke outrage and demonize Apple. For example: > Every artist, performer and creator on Patreon is about to get screwed out of 30% of their gross revenue, which will be diverted to Apple. This is inaccurate, as not all Patreon subscribers use iOS devices to support creators. reply Doches 5 hours agoprevThis article reads like an uneducated rant in so, so many ways. Apple rolling over its sleep and squashing Patreon isn't 'enshittification', it's just textbook monopoly abuse.

What I don't get is advocating for radical civil obedience to a company's preferred trademark names. reply a_c_s 4 hours agorootparentCalling any of this \"radical\" is rather dramatic and framing it as \"obedience\" misses the point. If someone says \"My name is spelled e. e. cummings\" then writing it \"E. E. Cummings\" is weird. It feels either uninformed or a deliberate, though tiny, mark of disrespect. It would also be weird to spell the Motorola \"Razr\" phone's name as \"Razor\" as that's not the spelling Motorola gave it. It isn't about \"obeying\" the poet nor the corporation but rather following social norms to spell things as the named person (or the namer of the item) prefers it to be spelled. And if you don't follow this convention then... oh well, most people will probably forget about it seconds after they notice it as they have other things to think about. reply card_zero 4 hours agorootparentI remember many years ago representatives of Photoshop® visiting forums to tell us that we must always add the registered trademark symbol whenever we mention Photoshop® - sorry, Adobe Photoshop® - and that we mustn't use the verb \"photoshopped\" but must instead say \"digitally altered with Adobe Photoshop® software\".

It's like your \"need\" for supernatural bed-time stories that explain human suffering and make you feel cozy; they're just tall tales. You're taking this practice entirely on their word, your \"proof\" that this system works is a backwards understanding of determinism. The only realistic, grounded worldview is to conclude that we don't need fairytales, and that we repeat them as an axiomatic comfort and not a truth. Similar problem pervades with Apple. They have no written obligation to protect you, they've been caught lying about security at the request of larger entities than them. They have no technical obligation to provide a secure experience; no GrapheneOS equivalent exists for iPhone, and Apple sues researchers that attempt to dissect the production build of iOS. They cooperate with governmental bodies worldwide and cannot fend-off state-sponsored attacks even when thousands of personnel are targeted. Default programs like iMessage, Facetime and iCloud Mail are all vulnerable to zero-click exploits. The App Store regularly approves trojan horse variety malware masquerading as brands people trust. Apple's platform security is a veritable trainwreck. If you liken Apple's approach as the diametric opposite of Open Source security, then they are the perfect example of why this mindset fails. There are no half-measures with security, when someone locks your room without giving you the key it's not for your protection.

What’s the concrete proposal here? There ain’t much in the Debian repos, for example, that’s useful to me for anything but tinkering, as far as things that make my everyday life better and easier. I’d have to bring in closed-source software and engage with a bunch of megacorps to make an open-ecosystem device do anything I care to do beyond playing with it. How is that an improvement? What do I tell my wife to do with all this? My dad? “Here, I put an open-source os on your phone, it’ll get worse battery life, much of the automation you use daily is now not available, a bunch of platform features you use are gone, most of the apps you like aren’t here, and things like notifications are probably flakier than you’re used to. Just use the web browser for everything important”? Apple sucks. Sure, we agree. So what? The alternative is—unilaterally—largely disengaging with the benefits of computing technology in day-to-day life and waiting for the government to fix the whole shitty industry. The appeal of Apple is I get a partial solution to the problem of every damn “legitimate” company trying to spy on me and open up back doors to my system, that I can recommend to other people in my life, and since this solution is basically the exact opposite of “become a tech hermit” people will actually do it and be glad they did it.

The difference is that in this case, Apple can block you from patronizing another bookstore, by forcing you to forfeit the $1,000 you spent on your device and potentially many thousands more in media and data and other switching costs. The question at the heart of this issue is simple; do we own our devices, or not? When I pay $1,400 for a computer, do I own it? If yes, then why does Apple get to decide what I get to watch or not? And why does Apple prevent me from deciding what speech I get to engage with my device or not? The app store is, at its heart, an enabler of totalitarianism.

Their business model let them implement much stronger privacy guarantees than their competitors, and this differentiation has been a profitable avenue for them. But ultimately if there’s any lock-down they can get away with (i.e. without affecting their profits either directly or via fines and legislation) they’ll try it, and privacy/security misfeatures are a great way to couch these regressions without appearing directly hostile. That being said, I don’t think Apple’s privacy stance is all hot air, they publish plenty of white papers on their infrastructure.

There’s no doubt that Apple has realized privacy is a competitive advantage, and as a customer, it’s one of the reasons I give them money. Even if you could lay bare the deepest desires and true motives of everyone involved, the result of those motives is a product that is more private and more secure than most alternatives. To boil this down to “this is only about lock-in” completely sidesteps a myriad of other factors in play. Editing to add: I'm not saying Apple is blameless here or that their advertising goals and other business deals shouldn't be scrutinized. I'm not even saying that I buy their privacy marketing, but there is an objective difference between their current model and the companies that exist purely on the basis of selling customer data.

That's just revenue from one company and that's just to be the default search engine. reply haswell 4 hours agorootparentWhen people describe services where “the user is the product”, they’re generally referring to the fact that the primary business model of the company selling those services is to impinge on individual privacy by collecting extremely detailed information about those users and then selling that information to interested parties. It is that intimate detail that makes each user so valuable. Google is buying search traffic from Apple, not user dossiers. To conflate the two is a category error. Even when you consider Apple’s advertising business, it cannot be argued in good faith that they are behaving in the same way most large advertising-driven companies are operating. Selling ads is not by itself enough to make the claim that “users are the product”, and to whatever extent they are, the ad business is secondary and coexists with their core business of selling hardware and services. This remains a meaningful distinction for people who want to buy products not fully predicated on selling their private details. The reductionist take removes all context and makes it impossible to have a substantive discussion about these finer points, and reductionism in general is against site guidelines. reply brigadier132 4 hours agorootparent> When people describe services where “the user is the product”, they’re generally referring to the fact that the primary business model of the company selling those services is to impinge on individual privacy by collecting extremely detailed information about those users and then selling that information to interested parties.

The high customer satisfaction is the lock-in. High customer satisfaction can easily explain the success. The idea that lock-in breeds high customer satisfaction needs to be proven to me. Considering Microsoft’s dominance was cheered on by the Microsoft ecosystem and derided in customer satisfaction is noteworthy to me. Apple has high customer satisfaction and a vocal group that consider the happy customers lemmings. These vocalists believe if Apple got out of the way they could show the happy customers what good really is. reply pornel 3 hours agoparentThe app ecosystem is the lock-in, and creates a very high bar to entry for other players outside the Apple-Google duopoly. Note that Google has created a dependency on proprietary Google Play Services, and owns the Play Store, so even leveraging AOSP is not sufficient to overcome the barrier to entry. There are two established players. Apple can charge whatever they want, and Google can copy their strategy, because they know users have nowhere else to go (the number of people who will permanently switch to independent degoogled phones is too small to affect the duopolists' business) reply detourdog 3 hours agorootparentCustomer satisfaction is high and there are other platforms with lower bars. The high bar is the product differentiation that Apple is using. reply pornel 41 minutes agorootparentThe phones do lots of things, and a lot of them well, so overall satisfaction doesn't mean that App Store pricing is satisfactory, nor fair. Apple forbids developers from itemizing pricing and telling users how much Apple takes, interfering with informed consumer choice. The cut is well known on HN, but I'm not sure that most users are fully aware that they're overpaying 10x on transaction fees, and the major consequences that it's a cut of revenue and not profit — the developer takes all the risk, and needs to cover all the development costs from their part, and can be even in the red, while Apple has a guaranteed profit with a guaranteed margin from every sale. Apple can be easily making more profit than the developers themselves. reply Workaccount2 4 hours agoparentprevI think all that is needed is for customers to have the option to see \"what good really is\" reply talldayo 4 hours agoparentprevIf you're right, what's stopping Apple from providing the same service while also granting fair access to third-parties? If Apple's main product differentiation is customer satisfaction, then in-theory they won't suffer as much from exposure to competition. As we've seen with the App Store on MacOS and AppleTV though, Apple cannot rely on just their premium profile to push a service.

Because majority of the people expect that app exists for everything and because Patreon.com is not just a website, it is a complex web app. And a complex web app usually works better on smartphones when it is in the form of native mobile app than just a website in the internet browser.

Maybe there’s an argument for the creator posts being a bit more complex, but nothing a non PWA shouldn’t be able to handle well.

    "originBody": "More alert details International Study Detects Consciousness in Unresponsive Patients Aug 14, 2024 9 minute read Neurology Research share on facebook share on linkedIn share on X, formerly known as Twitter share by email print article Study co-led by Mass General Brigham found that one in four patients with severe brain injury who appeared unresponsive responded to instructions covertly. Understanding this phenomenon can help guide decisions about life-sustaining treatment, goals of care, and clinical management, according to the authors. New research co-led by experts at Mass General Brigham found that brain scans can detect consciousness in some patients with brain injury who are unresponsive. In the study, 241 participants with severe brain injury who do not respond when given a simple instruction were assessed with functional MRI (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), or both tests. During these tests, participants heard instructions, such as “imagine opening and closing your hand” followed, 15-30 seconds later by “stop imagining opening and closing your hand.” The fMRI and EEG brain responses showed that 60 (25 percent) of participants repeatedly followed this instruction covertly over minutes. According to the authors of the study, published August 15 in the New England Journal of Medicine, patients who demonstrate this phenomenon, called cognitive motor dissociation, understand language, remember instructions and can sustain attention, even though they appear unresponsive. For these patients, cognitive (i.e., thinking) abilities exceed, and are therefore dissociated from, motor abilities. “Some patients with severe brain injury do not appear to be processing their external world. However, when they are assessed with advanced techniques such as task-based fMRI and EEG, we can detect brain activity that suggests otherwise,” said lead study author Yelena Bodien, PhD, an investigator for the Spaulding-Harvard Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems and Massachusetts General Hospital’s Center for Neurotechnology and Neurorecovery. “These results bring up critical ethical, clinical, and scientific questions – such as how can we harness that unseen cognitive capacity to establish a system of communication and promote further recovery?” Following a significant brain injury, individuals may have a disorder of consciousness, which can include coma, a vegetative state or minimally conscious state. Since the first study demonstrating cognitive motor dissociation in individuals with disorders of consciousness was published nearly two decades ago, centers around the world have found that this condition occurs in approximately 15 to 20 percent of unresponsive patients. However, the current study suggests it could be present in 25 percent of patients, or even more. Cognitive motor dissociation was most common in participants assessed with fMRI and EEG, suggesting that multiple tests, using different approaches, may be required to ensure consciousness is not missed. This study included participant data from six different sites spanning the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe collected over approximately 15 years. Each site developed and rigorously tested their methods for detecting cognitive motor dissociation to minimize the possibility that a positive result was obtained spuriously. Some sites recruited participants from the intensive care unit just days after they sustained a severe brain injury, often from a trauma such as a car accident, a stroke or cardiac arrest. Other sites included participants who were months to years after their injury or illness and were living in nursing facilities or at home. In addition to studying the 241 participants who did not respond to simple instructions, the research included 112 participants who did respond to simple instructions at the bedside. This latter group would be expected to perform well on the fMRI and EEG tests, but, in 62 percent of those participants, researchers did not detect brain responses suggesting they were covertly following instructions. The authors note that this finding may reflect the complexity of the fMRI and EEG tasks and underscores the high-level of thinking skills required to perform them. Just knowing that somebody is cognitively aware and more capable than is immediately apparent, can alter their clinical care substantially. “Families have told us that once a positive test result revealing cognitive motor dissociation is shared with the patients’ clinical team, it can change the way that the team interacts with their loved one,” Bodien said. “Suddenly, the team is paying more attention to subtle behavioral signs that could be under volitional control, or speaking to the patient, or playing music in the room. On the other hand, failing to detect cognitive motor dissociation can have serious consequences, including premature withdrawal of life support, missed signs of awareness, and lack of access to intensive rehabilitation.” “We find that this kind of sharp dissociation of retained cognitive capabilities and no behavioral evidence of them is not uncommon. I think we now have an ethical obligation to engage with these patients, to try to help them connect to the world,” said senior study author Nicholas Schiff, MD, the Jerold B. Katz Professor of Neurology and Neuroscience in the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell Medicine and administrative lead of the consortium. “What we need here is what we in our consortium have been trying to get started for twenty years: a sustained effort to benefit patients who have disorders of consciousness with systematic medical research, technology development, and better clinical infrastructure. One limitation of the study was that the testing was not standardized; each of the study sites tested patients in their own way, creating variability within the data. In addition, many participants were enrolled because family members heard about the study and reached out to researchers. This recruitment approach limits the researchers’ ability to determine the global prevalence of cognitive motor dissociation. There are no professional guidelines that stipulate how cognitive motor dissociation should be assessed and most centers are unable to provide this testing; clinical translation will need to be a focal point for future research. “To continue our progress in this field, we need to validate our tools and to develop approaches for systematically and pragmatically assessing unresponsive patients so that the testing is more accessible”, said Bodien. “The Emerging Consciousness Program at Mass General Hospital offers these evaluations clinically, however elsewhere, a patient may have to enroll in a research study to get tested. We know that cognitive motor dissociation is not uncommon, but resources and infrastructure are required to optimize detection of this condition and provide adequate support to patients and their families.” The researchers added that the findings may spur research of specific interventions to foster effective communication, including brain-computer interfaces. A separate team of Mass General Brigham researchers are investigating brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) as a potential intervention that may one day have applications to many types of patients unable to effectively communicate. Another study published in the same August 15th issue of New England Journal of Medicine from co-author Leigh Hochberg, MD, PhD of Mass General Hospital's Department of Neurology and Center for Neurotechnology and Neurorecovery, reported that a man with ALS and severely impaired speech used an investigational BCI implant to convert his attempted speech into text on a screen. Read more about that study, and about the BrainGate clinical trials for which Hochberg serves as principal investigator.

I can't help but wonder how many developers are now considering whether iOS support for PWAs is good enough to sidestep this crap entirely. Tim Cook really needs to learn the definition of the word \"symbiosis\", because a smartphone with no third-party software is barely worth anything. reply hahamaster 19 hours agorootparent> how many developers are now considering whether iOS support for PWAs is good enough to sidestep this crap entirely. It's hard to make any money on a PWA. reply cmeacham98 20 hours agorootparentprevAre they though? I haven't seen any evidence to suggest significant migration away from the iOS App Store. I was under the impression that devs and consumers that cared about side-loading largely already self-selected to Android. reply johnnyanmac 20 hours agorootparentYes, that's market capture. Odds are most people won't even know about other stores on IOS, for years on end. >I was under the impression that devs and consumers that cared about side-loading largely already self-selected to Android. Consumers mostly did, devs would still appreciate the feature since usually the choice isn't to make only an android nor only an iPhone app. reply layer8 19 hours agorootparentprevIt's certainly a major disincentive for me to start developing iOS apps. Dealing with all that patronization and red tape is off-putting and feels just not worth it for projects that you want to do for personal edification and fulfillment. IOS not being particularly fun to develop for likely hurts the platform to some degree. reply dns_snek 20 hours agorootparentprevIt's no surprise that Apple tries to grift developers by creatively redefining the scope of what the developer fees actually get you. Coming up with the slimiest ways to extract money is the core of their DNA. I expect that in a few years they'll say that their \"Core technology fee\" doesn't actually cover the full development experience, only the \"core\" of their technology, i.e. the compiler, while device-specific frameworks/libraries ought to cost extra for the relationship to be \"fair\". As you say, Apple have forgotten how their relationship with 3rd party developers really works. They owe their success in the mobile space to them, yet they're so quick to brush them off and have the nerve to say that actually, developers should be paying them for the privilege - it's disturbing. reply idle_zealot 21 hours agoparentprevIt, among other things, is being investigated by the EC. I wouldn't expect it to be deemed acceptable under the spirit of the DMA, it's just Apple throwing a fit and making their compliance as painful and slow as possible, perhaps in the hope that sentiment towards the new rules will grow sour before they actually have to open their platform. reply littlestymaar 20 hours agoparentprevApple is playing with European Commission's proverbial patience, but in the end they will likely declare that illegal as well. reply Alifatisk 21 hours agoprevThis is so cool, I can still remember the days where I installed Antutu and altstore for getting some apps for free. And now, I can actually download AltStore as an official third-part store without worrying about apps getting revoked again. reply layer8 21 hours agoparentApple still has to review and approve each single app update [0], and apps invariably tend to need updating sooner or later for new iOS versions. [0] https://support.apple.com/en-us/117767#:~:text=All%20apps%20.... reply sebazzz 3 hours agorootparentIf Apple still has to review everything, why would one publish on an altstore anyway? You aren’t cheaper (still need to pay that $90 per year) and you severely limit your audience. reply whazor 2 hours agorootparentThere are now some torrent apps in the Altstore that are not allowed in the Apple app store. So the Apple review is more limited. reply ripply 3 hours agorootparentprevThey publish there because they aren't allowed to publish their app on the app store, which is the whole point of the legislation that precipitated this. reply johnnyanmac 19 hours agorootparentprev> Apple does not enforce the App Store's high standards for business practices and content on apps distributed through alternative app distribution. I guess we'll see how well this ages. I just know some 18+ store is going to release within 12 months and that will truly test if Apple is just \"testing for security\" or not. I suppose EGS and assumedly Fortnite got approved, so that was the other hoop I worried about. This can still potentially mean issues for stuff like Beeper and iSH style apps , though. reply mrkramer 20 hours agoprevMonopoly sucks, Apple is the living proof. reply solarkraft 18 hours agoprevOf course I’m excited, but on further thought I wonder whether this could be set up better. As far as I understand it a MegaGrant is just a bunch of money, which AltStore can freely use and they decided to use it to cover Apple’s excessive fee. Had Epic pledged to pay the fee, they would have had a good reason to fight it (which, as far as I understand, they want to anyway). I’m still waiting for legal exchanges over both notarization and the fee. reply solarkraft 19 hours agoprevI’ve been waiting for somebody to sue over notarization (the reason I STILL can’t install the Pebble app) and my biggest hope was on AltStore. This type of support gives me hope that something is going to happen in this area. Thanks to Riley for putting so much effort into this and thanks to Epic for accidentally being on the side of user freedom :-) reply RockRobotRock 19 hours agoprev [–] So fucking funny, what a middle finger to Apple.
